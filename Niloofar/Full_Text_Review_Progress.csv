A theoretical framework for evaluating mental workload resources in human systems design for manufacturing operations,"As the nature of manufacturing work is changing, requiring more cognitive demands, there is a need to develop system models for measuring and predicting human performance in repetitive task operations. This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATE, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry: This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Profiling cognitive workload in an unmanned vehicle control task with cognitive models and physiological metrics,"In the present study, we use Cognitive Metrics Profiling (CMP) to capture variance in cognitive load within a complex unmanned vehicle control task. We aim to demonstrate convergent validity with existing workload measurement methods, and to decompose workload into constituent cognitive resources to aid in diagnosing causes of workload. A cognitive model of the task was developed and examined to determine the extent to which it could predict behavioral performance, subjective workload, and validated physiological workload metrics. We also examined model activity to draw insights regarding loaded cognitive capacities. We found that composite workload from the model predicted physiological metrics, performance, and subjective workload. Moreover, the model indicates that differences in workload were driven largely by procedural, declarative, and temporal memory demands. We have found preliminary evidence of correspondence between workload predictions of a CMP model and physiological measures of workload. This suggests our approach captures interesting aspects of workload in a complex task environment and may provide a theoretical link between behavioral, physiological, and subjective metrics. This approach may provide a means to design effective workload mitigation interventions and improve decision-making about personnel tasking and automation.","Stevens, CA; Morris, MB; Fisher, CR; Myers, CW",MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY,2023,Article,10.1080/08995605.2022.2130673,4,Psychology,Cognitive workload; computational modeling; EEG; cognitive architecture; memory; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MENTAL WORKLOAD; ACT-R; EEG; ARCHITECTURE; INDEXES,"Profiling cognitive workload in an unmanned vehicle control task with cognitive models and physiological metrics In the present study, we use Cognitive Metrics Profiling (CMP) to capture variance in cognitive load within a complex unmanned vehicle control task.

Towards the Integration and Evaluation of Online Workload Measures in a Cognitive Architecture,"Adapting an automation system to the workload level of a human operator can be beneficial in many situations, e.g. at industrial workplaces or in safety-critical situations like driving and flying an aircraft. However, this requires real-time assessment of workload. We present a model-based approach for online simulation and assessment of cognitive workload, based on analysing the activities of a cognitive architecture during simulation. A driving simulator experiment was used to evaluate the approach. The cognitive workload of participants was manipulated with a variant of the n-back task as secondary task that parametrically varies memory workload. A virtual driver model was created using the cognitive architecture. The model was simulated in the same situations as the human drivers. The activities of the cognitive architecture as indicator of cognitive workload increased with increasing difficulty of the n-back task. To relate model workload to human driver workload, we compared it with neurophysiological workload measures based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain activation as a complementary measure.","Wortelen, B; Unni, A; Rieger, JW; LÃ¼dtke, A",2016 7TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE INFOCOMMUNICATIONS (COGINFOCOM),2016,Proceedings Paper,,12,Engineering; Telecommunications,cognitive workload; cognitive architecture; physiological measure; driving; n-back task; fNIRS; DRIVERS; PILOT,"Towards the Integration and Evaluation of Online Workload Measures in a Cognitive Architecture Adapting an automation system to the workload level of a human operator can be beneficial in many situations, e.g. at industrial workplaces or in safety-critical situations like driving and flying an aircraft.

Determining Cognitive Workload Using Physiological Measurements: Pupillometry and Heart-Rate Variability,"The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing systems has accelerated in recent years, with a shift towards understanding operators' well-being and resilience within the context of creating a human-centric manufacturing environment. In addition to measuring physical workload, monitoring operators' cognitive workload is becoming a key element in maintaining a healthy and high-performing working environment in future digitalized manufacturing systems. The current approaches to the measurement of cognitive workload may be inadequate when human operators are faced with a series of new digitalized technologies, where their impact on operators' mental workload and performance needs to be better understood. Therefore, a new method for measuring and determining the cognitive workload is required. Here, we propose a new method for determining cognitive-workload indices in a human-centric environment. The approach provides a method to define and verify the relationships between the factors of task complexity, cognitive workload, operators' level of expertise, and indirectly, the operator performance level in a highly digitalized manufacturing environment. Our strategy is tested in a series of experiments where operators perform assembly tasks on a Wankel Engine block. The physiological signals from heart-rate variability and pupillometry bio-markers of 17 operators were captured and analysed using eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant differences in both cardiac and pupillometry-based cognitive load indices across the four task complexity levels (rest, low, medium, and high). Notably, these developed indices also provide better indications of cognitive load responding to changes in complexity compared to other measures. Additionally, while experts appear to exhibit lower cognitive loads across all complexity levels, further analysis is required to confirm statistically significant differences. In conclusion, the results from both measurement sensors are found to be compatible and in support of the proposed new approach. Our strategy should be useful for designing and optimizing workplace environments based on the cognitive load experienced by operators.","Ma, XY; Monfared, R; Grant, R; Goh, YM",SENSORS,2024,Article,10.3390/s24062010,2,Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,cognitive workload; task performance; pupillometry; heart-rate variability; cognitive-workload index; STRESS,"Determining Cognitive Workload Using Physiological Measurements: Pupillometry and Heart-Rate Variability The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing systems has accelerated in recent years, with a shift towards understanding operators' well-being and resilience within the context of creating a human-centric manufacturing environment.

Using Past and Present Indicators of Human Workload to Explain Variance in Human Performance,"Cognitive workload is assumed to influence performance due to resource competition. However, there is a lack of evidence for a direct relationship between changes in workload within an individual over time and changes in that individual's performance. We collected performance data using a multiple object-tracking task in which we measured workload objectively in real-time using a modified detection response task. Using a multi-level Bayesian model controlling for task difficulty and past performance, we found strong evidence that workload both during and preceding a tracking trial was predictive of performance, such that higher workload led to poorer performance. These negative workload-performance relationships were remarkably consistent across individuals. Importantly, we demonstrate that fluctuations in workload independent from the task demands accounted for significant performance variation. The outcomes have implications for designing real-time adaptive systems to proactively mitigate human performance decrements, but also highlight the pervasive influence of cognitive workload more generally.","Howard, ZL; Innes, R; Eidels, A; Loft, S",PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,2021,Article,10.3758/s13423-021-01961-6,7,Psychology,Cognitive and attentional control; Attention and executive control; Bayesian statistics; Dual-task performance; MENTAL WORKLOAD; EGO DEPLETION; DISTRACTION; AUTOMATION; ATTENTION; ACCOUNT; MODEL,"Using Past and Present Indicators of Human Workload to Explain Variance in Human Performance Cognitive workload is assumed to influence performance due to resource competition.

Effect of cognitive automation in a material handling system on manufacturing flexibility,"Manufacturing flexibility has become a competitive strategy to deal with market uncertainty. The application of advanced automation technology in manufacturing systems has tremendously increased manufacturing flexibility; however, this creates significant mental pressure for operators who must deal with a series of decisions, and this decreases their job satisfaction. In this study, we primarily investigated how cognitive automation and mechanical automaton in the material handling system affect manufacturing flexibility. Cognitive automation is defined as a computerized system that provides relevant information to operators, thereby reducing the cognitive workload; mechanical automation refers to an automated system to reduce the physical workload. The case of a truck-body production line of a truck company was investigated by applying modified DYNAMO+ + for the material handling system. Then, a simulation program, AnyLogic 6.9.0 was used to investigate the effect of the cognitive and mechanical automation in the material handling system on manufacturing flexibility. The research results showed that the levels of cognitive and mechanical automation of the material handling system were increased by 52.4% and 48.0%, respectively, which resulted in improving manufacturing flexibility by 14.2% in cycle time, 53.3% in downtime, and 26.3% in the number of tasks. Cognitive automation, in particular, contributed total improvements in cycle time and downtime of 64.2% and 74.1%, respectively, which showed that cognitive automation has a very critical effect on manufacturing flexibility in the material handling system.

Overloaded and at Work: Investigating the Effect of Cognitive Workload on Assembly Task Performance,"Objective This study investigates the effect of cognitive overload on assembly task performance and muscle activity. Background Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. Method Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. Results Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by then-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. Conclusion This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times.

What do subjective workload scales really measure? Operational and representational solutions to divergence of workload measures,"We examine the continuing use of subjective workload responses to index an operator's state, either by themselves or as part of a collective suite of measurements. Lack of convergence of subjective scales with physiological and performance-based measures calls into question whether there is any unitary workload construct that underpins conscious experience, physiological state and the individual's profile of task-related performance. We examine philosophical and measurement perspectives on the divergence problem, and we consider three possible solutions. First, difficulties in reliable and valid measurement of workload may contribute to divergence but do not fully explain it. Second, workload may be treated operationally: use of specific measures is justified by demonstrating their pragmatic utility in predicting important outcomes. Third, further efforts may be made to develop representational workload measurements that correspond to real empirical phenomena. Application of formal standards for test validity can identify multiple latent constructs supporting subjective workload, including those defining self-regulation in performance contexts.

Effect of interface design on cognitive workload in unmanned aerial vehicle control,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control interfaces are critical channels for transferring information between the vehicle and an operator. Research on system performance has focused on enhancing vehicle automation and some work has evaluated cognitive workload for existing UAV interfaces. The potential for usable interface design to reduce cognitive workload during the early design phase has been largely overlooked.

We prototyped three different interface designs, classified as baseline, enhanced and degraded interfaces. Cognitive workload in UAV operation was manipulated in terms of levels of vehicle speed (low and high). Physiological and subjective measures of workload were collected for all combinations of interface design and task demand.

Real-time prediction of short-timescale fluctuations in cognitive workload,"Human operators often experience large fluctuations in cognitive workload over seconds timescales that can lead to sub-optimal performance, ranging from overload to neglect. Adaptive automation could potentially address this issue, but to do so it needs to be aware of real-time changes in operators' spare cognitive capacity, so it can provide help in times of peak demand and take advantage of troughs to elicit operator engagement. However, it is unclear whether rapid changes in task demands are reflected in similarly rapid fluctuations in spare capacity, and if so what aspects of responses to those demands are predictive of the current level of spare capacity. We used the ISO standard detection response task (DRT) to measure cognitive workload approximately every 4 s in a demanding task requiring monitoring and refueling of a fleet of simulated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We showed that the DRT provided a valid measure that can detect differences in workload due to changes in the number of UAVs. We used cross-validation to assess whether measures related to task performance immediately preceding the DRT could predict detection performance as a proxy for cognitive workload. Although the simple occurrence of task events had weak predictive ability, composite measures that tapped operators' situational awareness with respect to fuel levels were much more effective. We conclude that cognitive workload does vary rapidly as a function of recent task events, and that real-time predictive models of operators' cognitive workload provide a potential avenue for automation to adapt without an ongoing need for intrusive workload measurements.","Boehm, U; Matzke, D; Gretton, M; Castro, S; Cooper, J; Skinner, M; Strayer, D; Heathcote, A",COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS,2021,Article,10.1186/s41235-021-00289-y,8,Psychology,Cognitive workload; Detection response task; Cross-validation; Workload prediction; Human-automation teaming; MENTAL WORKLOAD; MODEL SELECTION; SYSTEM; TASKS; PERFORMANCE; COMPLEXITY,"Real-time prediction of short-timescale fluctuations in cognitive workload Human operators often experience large fluctuations in cognitive workload over seconds timescales that can lead to sub-optimal performance, ranging from overload to neglect.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to compare NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) toWorkload Profile (WP) in terms of their sensitivity. The comparison considers the impact of experience and task differentiation in the same individual once a degree of experience has been developed in the execution of the same tasks. It also considers the acceptability and intrusivity of the techniques. METHODS: The sample consisted of 30 participants who performed four tasks in two sessions. The first session was performed when participants had no experience; the second session was performed after a time of practice. Mental workload was assessed after each session. Statistical methods were used to compare the results. RESULTS: The NASA-TLX proved to be more sensitive to experience, while the WP showed greater sensitivity to task differentiation. In addition, while both techniques featured a similar degree of intrusivity, the NASA-TLX received greater acceptability.

Using Cognitive Workload Analysis to Predict and Mitigate Workload for Training Simulation,"Constructive simulation-based training does not always go according to plan. Instructors observe scenarios and direct adaptive responses to unexpected events. Simulation operators typically use a graphical interface to monitor the scenario and generate specific interventions that implement the instructor's intent. These activities require the operators' attention and cognitive resources, particularly for complex directions and scenarios with multiple entities to monitor. We are developing automated tools to reduce operator workload, thereby increasing the cost effectiveness of training. We use cognitive workload analysis to identify situations in which operators would be overloaded, and to identify the factors that cause the overloading. By identifying workload hot spots, we can target more effective automated support strategies. GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection) is a theoretical framework for workload analysis that has been applied to many modeling and automation applications. We use GOMS to create a detailed characterization of a set of typical monitoring and intervention tasks for fixed-wing air combat training.

A robust operators' cognitive workload recognition method based on masked autoencoder,"Identifying the cognitive workload of operators is crucial in complex human-automation collaboration systems. An excessive workload can lead to fatigue or accidents, while an insufficient workload may diminish situational awareness and efficiency. However, existing supervised learning-based methods for workload recognition are ineffective when dealing with imperfect input data, such as missing or noisy data, which is not practical in real applications. This study introduces a robust Electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled cognitive workload recognition model using self-supervised learning. The proposed method, DMAEEG, combines the training strategies of denoising autoencoders and masked autoencoders, demonstrating strong robustness against noisy and incomplete data. More specifically, we adopt the temporal convolutional network and multi-head self- attention mechanisms as the backbone, effectively capturing both the temporal and spatial features from EEG. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on an open dataset and a self-collected dataset. The results indicate that DMAEEG performs superior to other state-of-the-art across various evaluation metrics. Moreover, DMAEEG maintains high accuracy in workload inference even when EEG signals are corrupted with a high masking ratio or strong noises. This signifies its superiority in capturing robust intrinsic patterns from imperfect EEG data.

However, existing supervised learning-based methods for workload recognition are ineffective when dealing with imperfect input data, such as missing or noisy data, which is not practical in real applications. This study introduces a robust Electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled cognitive workload recognition model using self-supervised learning. The proposed method, DMAEEG, combines the training strategies of denoising autoencoders and masked autoencoders, demonstrating strong robustness against noisy and incomplete data. More specifically, we adopt the temporal convolutional network and multi-head self- attention mechanisms as the backbone, effectively capturing both the temporal and spatial features from EEG. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on an open dataset and a self-collected dataset. The results indicate that DMAEEG performs superior to other state-of-the-art across various evaluation metrics. Moreover, DMAEEG maintains high accuracy in workload inference even when EEG signals are corrupted with a high masking ratio or strong noises. This signifies its superiority in capturing robust intrinsic patterns from imperfect EEG data.

Electroencephalographic Workload Indicators During Teleoperation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Shepherding a Swarm of Unmanned Ground Vehicles in Contested Environments,"Background: Although many electroencephalographic (EEG) indicators have been proposed in the literature, it is unclear which of the power bands and various indices are best as indicators of mental workload. Spectral powers (Theta, Alpha, and Beta) and ratios (Beta/(Alpha + Theta), Theta/Alpha, Theta/Beta) were identified in the literature as prominent indicators of cognitive workload. Objective: The aim of the present study is to identify a set of EEG indicators that can be used for the objective assessment of cognitive workload in a multitasking setting and as a foundational step toward a human-autonomy augmented cognition system. Methods: The participants' perceived workload was modulated during a teleoperation task involving an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shepherding a swarm of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Three sources of data were recorded from sixteen participants (n = 16): heart rate (HR), EEG, and subjective indicators of the perceived workload using the Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT). Results: The HR data predicted the scores from ATWIT. Nineteen common EEG features offered a discriminatory power of the four workload setups with high classification accuracy (82.23%), exhibiting a higher sensitivity than ATWIT and HR.

Multi-class classification of control room operators' cognitive workload using the fusion of eye-tracking and electroencephalography,"Chemical process industries are hazard intensive. Most industrial accidents occur today due to human error. For safe and efficient operation, it is therefore critical to ensure optimal operator performance.

Dynamic assessment of control room operator's cognitive workload using Electroencephalography (EEG),"In modern plants with high levels of automation, acquiring an adequate mental model of the process has become a challenge for operators.

A Multimodal Approach to Investigate the Role of Cognitive Workload and User Interfaces in Human-Robot Collaboration,"One of the primary aims of Industry 5.0 is to refine the interaction between humans, machines, and robots by developing human-centered design solutions to enhance Human-Robot Collaboration, performance, trust, and safety. This research investigated how deploying a user interface utilizing a 2-D and 3-D display affects participants' cognitive effort, task performance, trust, and situational awareness while performing a collaborative task using a robot. The study used a within-subject design where fifteen participants were subjected to three conditions: no interface, display User Interface, and mixed reality User Interface where vision assistance was provided. Participants performed a pick-and-place task with a robot in each condition under two levels of cognitive workload (i.e., high and low). The cognitive workload was measured using subjective (i.e., NASA TLX) and objective measures (i.e., heart rate variability). Additionally, task performance, situation awareness, and trust when using these interfaces were measured to understand the impact of different user interfaces during a Human-Robot Collaboration task. Findings from this study indicated that cognitive workload and user interfaces impacted task performance, where a significant decrease in efficiency and accuracy was observed while using the mixed reality interface.

This research investigated how deploying a user interface utilizing a 2-D and 3-D display affects participants' cognitive effort, task performance, trust, and situational awareness while performing a collaborative task using a robot. The study used a within-subject design where fifteen participants were subjected to three conditions: no interface, display User Interface, and mixed reality User Interface where vision assistance was provided. Participants performed a pick-and-place task with a robot in each condition under two levels of cognitive workload (i.e., high and low). The cognitive workload was measured using subjective (i.e., NASA TLX) and objective measures (i.e., heart rate variability). Additionally, task performance, situation awareness, and trust when using these interfaces were measured to understand the impact of different user interfaces during a Human-Robot Collaboration task. Findings from this study indicated that cognitive workload and user interfaces impacted task performance, where a significant decrease in efficiency and accuracy was observed while using the mixed reality interface.

Evaluation of Fatigue and Workload among Workers Conducting Complex Manual Assembly in Manufacturing,"OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONS We conducted a study to evaluate fatigue and workload among workers performing complex assembly tasks. We investigate several predictors of fatigue, including subjective workload estimates, sleep duration, the shift being worked, and production levels. High levels of fatigue were reported in one-third of the shifts evaluated. The main predictors of high fatigue were workload estimates, working evening shifts, and baseline fatigue. Among the six dimensions of workload, only mental demand and frustration were predictors of high fatigue. Mental demand was also rated highest. Participants reported less than seven hours of sleep in 60% of the nights evaluated. These results suggest that managers and supervisors should consider cognitive workload as a key contributing factor to fatigue in complex manual assembly. Similarly, work schedule planning should consider shift duration, start times, and end times, because of the negative influence on fatigue and the potential disruptions on sleep among workers. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: General fatigue and mental workload have been studied extensively in safety-critical contexts; wherein human performance degradation can lead to catastrophic outcomes. In the manufacturing sector, the physical demands of a job have received most of the attention because of the presence of biomechanical loads and the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders. However, in complex manual assembly, cognitive and chronobiology aspects of work can contribute to fatigue and degrade worker performance. Purpose: We aimed to evaluate self-reported levels of fatigue and workload among a group of workers performing complex assembly tasks. We also sought to investigate several predictors of fatigue, including workload estimates, sleep duration, the shift being worked, and production levels. Methods: Fourteen assembly line workers participated in a two-week study. They evaluated their levels of fatigue at the beginning and end of each shift using the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Scale. They also evaluated their workload according to the NASA-TLX scale at the end of each shift. Results: High levels of fatigue (fatigue score >= 5) were reported in approximately one-third of 114 work shifts evaluated. Binary logistic regression indicated that fatigue scores at the beginning of the shift, NASA-TLX scores, and working evening shifts were significant predictors of high levels of fatigue. Among the six dimensions measured by NASA-TLX, only mental demand and frustration were predictors of high fatigue. Mental demand was also rated highest by the workers. Participants reported less than seven hours of sleep in 60% of the nights evaluated. Conclusions: These results suggest that cognitive load can contribute to fatigue in complex manual assembly work. Circadian and homeostatic processes related to shift duration, start times, and end times are also potential contributing factors. Similarly, existing work schedules may be contributing to sleep disruptions among workers.","Torres, Y; Nadeau, S; Landau, K",IISE TRANSACTIONS ON OCCUPATIONAL ERGONOMICS & HUMAN FACTORS,2021,Article,10.1080/24725838.2021.1997835,8,Engineering,Production demand; shift work; sleep; mental demand; subjective metrics; NASA-TLX; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; MENTAL WORKLOAD; SLEEP; QUALITY; ERGONOMICS; TASK; INSTRUCTIONS; PRINCIPLES; HEALTH,"Evaluation of Fatigue and Workload among Workers Conducting Complex Manual Assembly in Manufacturing OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONS We conducted a study to evaluate fatigue and workload among workers performing complex assembly tasks.

The Moderating Effects of Task Complexity and Age on the Relationship between Automation Use and Cognitive Workload,"In recent decades, automation has become increasingly integrated into knowledge work environments, i.e., jobs that require specialized skills for task completion. Some research has shown that automation may reduce cognitive workload. However, other work reports that increasing automation does not always lower cognitive workload. These conflicting results suggest that further investigation is needed to identify factors that influence the relationship between automation use and cognitive workload. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how two potential moderators, task complexity and age, influence that relationship. A total of 24 younger and 24 middle-aged adults performed an object identification task that resembled a baggage scanning procedure conducted by airport security personnel. The task was manipulated by varying the level of automation (4 increasing levels) that provided support in identifying objects of interest as well as the complexity of task (two types: component and coordinative). In addition, participants completed a pattern identification and sorting memory task, which helped emulate a knowledge work environment. Performance (i.e., object identification accuracy, average completion time, pattern identification accuracy, and sorting memory task accuracy) and subjective workload (NASA-RTLX score) measures were recorded. Participants also rated the usability of the automation. Overall, results showed that while the use of automation was associated with reduced cognitive workload, both types of task complexity negatively affected this relationship such that increased complexity was associated with a decrease in accuracy. Age did not moderate the relationship between automation and cognitive workload, but there were qualitative differences in terms of how the two age groups perceived the utility and usability of the automated systems.

A multi-measure approach for connecting cognitive workload and automation,"Eye behavior metrics, time of run, and subjective survey results were assessed during human-computer interaction with high, low, and intermediate system autonomy levels. The results of this study are provided as a contribution to knowledge on the relationship between cognitive workload physiology and automation. Research suggests that changes in eye behavior metrics are related to changes in cognitive workload. Few studies have investigated the relationship between eye behavior metrics physiology measures and levels of automation.

Human interaction with robotic systems: performance and workload evaluations,"We first tested the effect of differing tactile informational forms (i.e. directional cues vs. static cues vs. dynamic cues) on objective performance and perceived workload in a collaborative human-robot task.

The effect of cognitive workload on decision authority assignment in human-robot collaboration,"Human-robot collaboration in dynamic industrial environments warrants robot flexibility and shifting between tasks. Adaptive robot behavior unavoidably carries decision-making needs regarding task allocation and scheduling. Such decisions can be made either by the human team members or autonomously, by the robot's controlling algorithm. Human authority may help preserve situational awareness but increases mental demands due to increased responsibilities. Conversely, granting authority to the robot can offload the operator, at the cost of reduced intervention readiness. This paper aims to investigate the question of decision authority assignment in a human-robot team, in terms of performance, perceived workload and subjective preference. We hypothesized that the answer is influenced by the cognitive workload imposed on the human operator by the work process. An experiment with 21 participants was conducted, in which decision authority and induced workload through a secondary task were varied between trials. Results confirmed that operators can support the robot better when decision authority is allocated according to their workload. However, operator decision authority (a) may cause inferior performance at any secondary tasks performed in parallel with robot supervision and (b) increases perceived workload. Subjective preference was found to be evenly divided between the two levels of decision authority, and unaffected by task difficulty.

Adaptive robot behavior unavoidably carries decision-making needs regarding task allocation and scheduling. Such decisions can be made either by the human team members or autonomously, by the robot's controlling algorithm. Human authority may help preserve situational awareness but increases mental demands due to increased responsibilities. Conversely, granting authority to the robot can offload the operator, at the cost of reduced intervention readiness. This paper aims to investigate the question of decision authority assignment in a human-robot team, in terms of performance, perceived workload and subjective preference. We hypothesized that the answer is influenced by the cognitive workload imposed on the human operator by the work process. An experiment with 21 participants was conducted, in which decision authority and induced workload through a secondary task were varied between trials. Results confirmed that operators can support the robot better when decision authority is allocated according to their workload. However, operator decision authority (a) may cause inferior performance at any secondary tasks performed in parallel with robot supervision and (b) increases perceived workload. Subjective preference was found to be evenly divided between the two levels of decision authority, and unaffected by task difficulty. In brief, if human-robot team performance is a priority, humans should be granted decision authority when their overall workload allows it.

"Effects of unreliable automation, non-driving related task, and takeover time budget on drivers' takeover performance and workload","The objective of this study was to assess the effects of unreliable automation, non-driving related tasks (NDRTs), and takeover time budget (TOTB) on drivers' takeover performance and cognitive workload when faced with critical incidents. Automated vehicles are expected to improve traffic safety. However, there are still some concerns about the effects of automation failures on driver performance and workload. Twenty-eight drivers participated in a driving simulation study. The findings suggested that drivers require at least 8 s of TOTB to safely take over the control of the vehicle. In addition, drivers exhibited safer takeover performance under the conditionally automated driving situation than negotiating the critical incident in the manual driving condition. The results of drivers' cognitive workload were inconclusive, which might be due to the individual and recall biases in subjective measures that could not capture subtle differences in workload during takeover requests. Practitioner Summary: A driving simulation study was conducted to assess the effect of unreliable automation, non-driving related tasks, and different takeover time budgets on drivers' performance and workload.

Measuring workload effects of augmented reality head-up displays using detection response task,"Augmented reality (AR) technology could establish direct relationships between displayed information and objects in the real driving environment, e.g. by highlighting relevant objects in the traffic environment. However, it is unclear how these potential benefits of augmentation affect drivers' distraction from the driving task and their level of workload. Since gaze detection cannot separate glances at AR-elements from glances at the driving scene, new evaluation criteria are needed for measuring the distraction potential of AR-elements. The paper evaluates a methodology based on the Detection Response Task (DRT) for measuring the distraction and workload effects of three different display technologies: Head-Down Display (HDD), Head-Up Display (HUD), and Augmented-Reality HUD (AR-HUD). The DRT measures cognitive and visual workload based on a recognition-response task using the two parameters, reaction time and misses. Two experimental studies using driving simulation (N = 24) and production vehicles in real traffic (N = 24) are reported. As use cases, the subjects had to navigate through an urban traffic environment and pass different intersections. During that they were assisted by navigation systems based on the above mentioned display technologies. The resulting workload is compared to a baseline drive without the need to navigate and a reference drive in which the subjects had to work on a secondary task while driving. The results of the DRT are compared with subjective measures, gaze behaviour, and driving performance. In addition, drivers' preference and user experience regarding the three display technologies and their feedback concerning the DRT method were assessed. The results of both experimental studies show that drivers prefer the AR-HUD display technology. Reasons are mainly the hedonic aspects of the AR-HUD such as the novelty of the technology. Nevertheless, drivers report that AR-elements could obstruct important areas of the road and distract more from the driving task than HUDs. The subjective and visual-cognitive workload measured by the DRT do not differ between the HMI conditions. An analysis for each type of intersection yields most misses for the AR-HUD condition and fewest misses in the HDD condition. However, visual workload (i.e. eyes-off-road time) is higher for HDD compared to (AR-)HUD. Feedback by participants reveals that the DRT as a method for workload assessment is well accepted. All in all, the two DRT measures, misses and reaction time, allow a valid and objective workload measurement and could serve as a supplement or substitute for gaze analysis.

Advanced workstations and collaborative robots: exploiting eye-tracking and cardiac activity indices to unveil senior workers' mental workload in assembly tasks,"Introduction: As a result of Industry 5.0's technological advancements, collaborative robots (cobots) have emerged as pivotal enablers for refining manufacturing processes while re-focusing on humans. However, the successful integration of these cutting-edge tools hinges on a better understanding of human factors when interacting with such new technologies, eventually fostering workers' trust and acceptance and promoting low-fatigue work. This study thus delves into the intricate dynamics of human-cobot interactions by adopting a human-centric view.Methods: With this intent, we targeted senior workers, who often contend with diminishing work capabilities, and we explored the nexus between various human factors and task outcomes during a joint assembly operation with a cobot on an ergonomic workstation. Exploiting a dual-task manipulation to increase the task demand, we measured performance, subjective perceptions, eye-tracking indices and cardiac activity during the task. Firstly, we provided an overview of the senior workers' perceptions regarding their shared work with the cobot, by measuring technology acceptance, perceived wellbeing, work experience, and the estimated social impact of this technology in the industrial sector. Secondly, we asked whether the considered human factors varied significantly under dual-tasking, thus responding to a higher mental load while working alongside the cobot. Finally, we explored the predictive power of the collected measurements over the number of errors committed at the work task and the participants' perceived workload.Results: The present findings demonstrated how senior workers exhibited strong acceptance and positive experiences with our advanced workstation and the cobot, even under higher mental strain. Besides, their task performance suffered increased errors and duration during dual-tasking, while the eye behavior partially reflected the increased mental demand. Some interesting outcomes were also gained about the predictive power of some of the collected indices over the number of errors committed at the assembly task, even though the same did not apply to predicting perceived workload levels.Discussion: Overall, the paper discusses possible applications of these results in the 5.0 manufacturing sector, emphasizing the importance of adopting a holistic human-centered approach to understand the human-cobot complex better.","Pluchino, P; Pernice, GFA; Nenna, F; Mingardi, M; Bettelli, A; Bacchin, D; Spagnolli, A; Jacucci, G; Ragazzon, A; Miglioranzi, L; Pettenon, C; Gamberini, L",FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI,2023,Article,10.3389/frobt.2023.1275572,1,Robotics,human factors; ergonomic workstations; collaborative robots; mental workload; psychophysiology; COGNITIVE WORKLOAD; NASA-TLX; DESIGN; ACCEPTANCE; MODEL; TRUST,"Advanced workstations and collaborative robots: exploiting eye-tracking and cardiac activity indices to unveil senior workers' mental workload in assembly tasks Introduction: As a result of Industry 5.0's technological advancements, collaborative robots (cobots) have emerged as pivotal enablers for refining manufacturing processes while re-focusing on humans.
