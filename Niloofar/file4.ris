AB  - Contemporary industrial environments are usually constrained or limited in order to fit a fast, cheap and non-error prone production. Human-like system capabilities are not generally desirable there. But, recent trends in industrial robotics demand robust, flexible and efficient robots with a certain level of autonomy. Therefore, new and different approaches and perspectives in designing of industrial facilities are required. This paper reveals how a context-based reasoning can be used to achieve an intelligent robot group behavior. In order to achieve adaptivity, self-recovery or scalability of the system, a COgnitive MOdel for the Robot group control (COMOR) is developed. COMOR can be understood as an interpreter used to transform high-level context to low-level data, allowing machines to make context-based decisions. COMOR has three main parts and relies on a simulated Social Capital phenomenon as a feature of people. The first part is used to collect significant information from the environment. The second part is used to provide a set of possible solutions respecting the semantic domain description. The last part of COMOR is used to provide a behavioral component ensuring an optimal solution to given environmental conditions.

AB  - Current Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) methods have focused on the impact of environmental conditions or Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) on human errors, while current research has ignored two aspects: one the influence of Human Inherent Factors (HIFs) associated with accidents, the other the Human Error Probability (HEP) calculations, whose results were not based on HIFs tests. The purpose of this study was to examine HEP based on HIFs’ assessments that contained physiological and psychological factor tests, including Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) was chosen as a framework. Additionally, the evaluation of Common Performance Commons (CPCs) was optimized so that assessment of CPCs in objective circumstances could be achieved. This method was applied within a pharmaceutical company to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in order for it to be more widely applied in HEP calculations in other various industries to appraise tasks in relation to status management, and staff personnel management.

AB  - This article presents a methodology for accident analysis developed from the combination of CAST - Causal Analysis based on System Theory, derived from the STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Process) accident causation model and the human error analysis/investigation tool TRACEr (Technique for the Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors). This combination was proposed from the perceived need to structure one of the stages of the application of the CAST technique where unsafe control actions, or human errors, that occurred in the course of accidental events are analyzed, for which the application of the TRACEr technique proved extremely useful. From the application of the proposed combination to an accident that occurred in an oil production unit in operation on the coast of southeastern Brazil, it was possible to obtain a deeper understanding of the psychological phenomena that preceded one of the unsafe control actions, as well as the identification of performance shaping factors that contributed to its occurrence. These results demonstrated the conceptual cohesion and mutual complementarity of the associated techniques, which allowed a comprehensive understanding of the accidental event and, consequently, the elaboration of safety recommendations more appropriate to the findings of the analysis, better specified to the aspects of human factors involved.

AB  - Human-robot collaborative (HRC) assembly has become popular in recent years. It takes full advantage of the strength, repeatability and accuracy of robots and the high-level cognition, flexibility and adaptability of humans to achieve an ergonomic working environment with better overall productivity. However, HRC assembly is still in its infancy nowadays. How to ensure the safety and efficiency of HRC assembly while reducing assembly failures caused by human errors is challenging. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a novel human-cyber-physical assembly system (HCPaS) framework, which combines the powerful perception and control capacity of digital twin with the virtual-reality interaction capacity of augmented reality (AR) to achieve a safe and efficient HRC environment. Based on the framework, a deep learning-enabled fusion method of HCPaS is proposed from the perspective of robot-level fusion and part-level fusion. Robot-level fusion perceives the pose of robots with the combination of PointNet and iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, where the status of robots together with their surroundings could be registered into AR environment to improve the human's cognitive ability of complex assembly environment, thus ensuring the safe HRC assembly. Part-level fusion recognizes the type and pose of parts being assembled with a parallel network that takes an extended Pixel-wise Voting Network (PVNet) as the base architecture, on which assembly sequence/process information of the part could be registered into AR environment to provide smart guidance for manual work to avoid human errors. Eventually, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach.

In this wireless communication incorporating cognitive radio supports for providing opportunistic wireless link to user optimally by sensing spectral environment. Since the sensors used are battery dependent, increasing the lifetime of network is an essential task, implementing machine learning approach dynamically indicate path for effective data transmission between network intermediate and server. Consequently, energy harvesting and standard deviation of utilised energy estimation also need to be concentrated in this work while number sensors are incorporated in WBAN. Proposed scheme is validated with effectiveness of numerical results and proposes modified algorithm with low computational complexity. Reducing energy consumption of mobile communication networks has gained significant attentions since it takes a major part of the total energy consumption of information and communication technology (ICT).

AB  - Forming strategic partnerships, particularly university partnerships, is among the important aspects of companies’ innovation strategies that shape their innovation performance. While research has uncovered many macro-level attributes of such partnerships, the micro-level, including the human side, of these inter-organizational relationships is only partly understood. We especially lack an understanding of how individual, manager-level characteristics facilitate company collaboration with partners such as universities. Applying a micro-foundational lens and building on 10 qualitative case studies, we identify how companies’ human capital helps overcome barriers and enhance the drivers of university–industry collaboration. We propose a two-dimensional framework consisting of companies’ human capital components and their managerial roles for university partnerships—attitudinal, relational, and cognitive—to guide future research on human capital in the context of university–industry strategic partnerships. The framework will also assist managers and recruiters in better understanding the role of human capital in their collaborations with universities.

AB  - Several research studies have ranked indoor pollution among the top environmental risks to public health in recent years. Good indoor air quality is an essential component of a healthy indoor environment and significantly affects human health and well-being. Poor air quality in such environments may cause respiratory disease for millions of pupils around the globe and, in the current pandemic-dominated era, require ever more urgent actions to tackle the burden of its impacts. The poor indoor quality in such environments could result from poor management, operation, maintenance, and cleaning. Pupils are a different segment of the population from adults in many ways, and they are more exposed to the poor indoor environment: They breathe in more air per unit weight and are more sensitive to heat/cold and moisture. Thus, their vulnerability is higher than adults, and poor conditions may affect proper development. However, a healthy learning environment can reduce the absence rate, improves test scores, and enhances pupil/teacher learning/teaching productivity. In this article, we analyzed recent literature on indoor air quality and health in schools, with the primary focus on ventilation, thermal comfort, productivity, and exposure risk. This study conducts a comprehensive review to summarizes the existing knowledge to highlight the latest research and solutions and proposes a roadmap for the future school environment. In conclusion, we summarize the critical limitations of the existing studies, reveal insights for future research directions, and propose a roadmap for further improvements in school air quality. More parameters and specific data should be obtained from in-site measurements to get a more in-depth understanding at contaminant characteristics. Meanwhile, site-specific strategies for different school locations, such as proximity to transportation routes and industrial areas, should be developed to suit the characteristics of schools in different regions. The socio-economic consequences of health and performance effects on children in classrooms should be considered. There is a great need for more comprehensive studies with larger sample sizes to study on environmental health exposure, student performance, and indoor satisfaction. More complex mitigation measures should be evaluated by considering energy efficiency, IAQ and health effects.

AB  - Organizations' value creation is dependent on the reliable and continuous operations of their inherently unreliable information systems (IS). Year after year industry and academic surveys show that IS-related incidents persist as a top concern on IS managers' agendas. While past research has addressed technological improvements and planning methodologies as a means of improving the continuity of organizational technologies (IS continuity), the “social” part – that is, the humans and their social and cognitive processes – has largely remained in the background and under researched. This current research seeks to bring to the foreground the implications of the social for IS continuity by developing conceptual foundations of the social dynamics in the IS continuity process. This study proposes a framework of IS continuity process with three phases: (1) preparing for incidents; (2) coping with and mitigating the impact of incidents; and (3) recovering from incidents. Implications of and potential theoretical and conceptual foundations for the social in the IS continuity process are discussed together with their practical implications. Addressing the challenges that pertain to the management of IS continuity requires multidisciplinary approaches that broadly take use of social and cognitive theories on individual and collective levels of analysis.

AB  - With the recent developments in robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI), academics and industrial practitioners are now pursuing robust and adaptive decision making (DM) in real-life engineering applications and automated business workflows and processes to accommodate context awareness, adaptation to environment and customisation. The emerging research via RPA, AI and soft computing offers sophisticated decision analysis methods, data-driven DM and scenario analysis with regard to the consideration of decision choices and provides benefits in numerous engineering applications. The emerging intelligent automation (IA) – the combination of RPA, AI and soft computing – can further transcend traditional DM to achieve unprecedented levels of operational efficiency, decision quality and system reliability. RPA allows an intelligent agent to eliminate operational errors and mimic manual routine decisions, including rule-based, well-structured and repetitive decisions involving enormous data, in a digital system, while AI has the cognitive capabilities to emulate the actions of human behaviour and process unstructured data via machine learning, natural language processing and image processing. Insights from IA drive new opportunities in providing automated DM processes, fault diagnosis, knowledge elicitation and solutions under complex decision environments with the presence of context-aware data, uncertainty and customer preferences. This sophisticated review attempts to deliver the relevant research directions and applications from the selected literature to the readers and address the key contributions of the selected literature, IA’s benefits, implementation considerations, challenges and potential IA applications to foster the relevant research development in the domain.

To build the model, a driving scenario was first identified based on the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) driving route. The driving model was created using IMPRINT, a discrete event simulation tool that characterizes four classes of human resources that may contribute to driver workload: visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor (VACP). For this initial model we tested limited number and type of distractions. The initial use of a sample of driver aids and their importance to mitigating driver distractions has also been included.
Relevance to Industry
This study investigated the use of a driver workload simulation model to provide commercial vehicle interface designers a tool to investigate the impact of the multiple activities an operator performs while driving. A simulation model can predict the changes in driver workload due to multiple secondary tasks performed in varying driving conditions.

AB  - Introduction
With an increase in the number of mentally demanding jobs, as well as the increase in work performed while sedentary, there is a growing imbalance in the use of body resources. This often results in an increase in fatigue in the working population. The diversity of the workforce is also increasing, whereas physiological differences based on culture are important to consider. The objective of this study was to identify the differences in the levels of fatigue in the workplace experienced by Asian and Western workers in mentally demanding jobs.
Method
Eight Asian and eight Western participants completed an observation-based study. Each participant was observed for four hours in their workplace while they were working on highly mentally demanding work-tasks either computer programming or mathematical simulations. To balance the effect of time, half of the participants from each ethnic group were observed in the morning session and the other half in the afternoon session. Perceived fatigue was measured every 30 min using the single dimensional Borg and multidimensional SOFI scales. Workload was measured using NASA-TLX, and as a change in resting heart rate.
Result
Ethnicity and time interacted to significantly affect the perceived fatigue measured by Borg (F (9,126) = 2.03, p = 0.0412) and SOFI (F(9,126) = 3.28, p = 0.0013) scales. Asian participants reported significantly higher workload measured by NASA-TLX scores (F(1, 14) = 3.68, p = 0.0024) and change in resting heart rate (F(1, 14) = 7.77, p = 0.0145) was measured higher compared to Western participants. Unlike fatigue, no significant interactions were observed between time and ethnicity to affect either NASA-TLX scores or change in resting heart rate. Post-hoc analyses show that the rate of fatigue was higher for Asian participants. Correlations between the dependent variables were significant (p < 0.0001), with a stronger correlation identified for Asian participants.
Conclusion
As compared to the Western participants, Asian participants reported higher values in all dependent measures, including fatigue in both scales, NASA-TLX scores, and change in resting heart rate.
Relevance to industry
The significant growth in white-collar as well as mentally demanding jobs requires more cognitive resources, while reducing physical activities. The consequences of the imbalances in the use of body resources have yet to be studied. This study has been designed to investigate the issues of imbalance in the workplace.

AB  - Since human errors are the critical factor contributing to accidents in safety-critical industries, human reliability analysis (HRA) becomes significant to improve the reliability of many complex engineering systems. In the real world, the assessment of human errors relies heavily on experts’ knowledge and experience. Moreover, there are challenges regarding the human error probability (HEP) estimation because of state evaluation information uncertainty, multiple common performance conditions (CPCs), and the correlations between CPCs. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a new improved cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) by integrating linguistic D numbers and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory-based analytic network process (DANP) method for the quantitative analysis of human errors. First, the linguistic D numbers are utilized to express the uncertain CPC state evaluations and the direct relations between CPCs provided by experts. Second, the DANP method is incorporated into the CREAM to determine the weights of CPCs considering their interdependencies and interactions. Then, a CPC effect index is introduced to quantify the CPCs’ overall effect upon performance reliability and obtain the HEP estimation. Finally, the feasibility and practicality of the proposed CREAM model are demonstrated through a practical case of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cargo loading process. The results show that the new improved CREAM can effectively capture the uncertain state evaluation information, better depict the interdependences between CPCs, and obtain more reasonable HEP estimation in the HRA.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of High-Performance Work Systems (HPWS) on radical and incremental innovation in the services industry. Insights from the Social Exchange Theory (SET) and Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) Framework have been used to assess the role of social capital (SC) as a mediator between HPWS, radical innovation (RI), and incremental innovation (II). By using a simple random sampling technique, 328 responses were received from respondents in Pakistan's banking sector firms. For data analysis, structural equation modeling was applied. The results of the study show that HPWS is a significant driver of II, but not RI, in banking sector firms. Moreover, SC plays the role of mediator in the HPWS-innovation link. Outcomes of the study extend the understanding of the “black-box” (i.e., the transmission mechanism between systems of human resources(HR) practices and innovation). It also contributes to understanding HPWS, SC, II, and RI in the context of Pakistan's banking sector. This study expands on earlier research in the areas of HPWS, SC, and Innovation. It supports the view that internal SC enables RI and II. Prior studies indicated that HPWS drives innovations, yet there has been no clear explanation about the mechanism of this effect. By providing empirical evidence on the mediating role of SC, this study expands on existing literature. Empirical validation of an association between HPWS RI, and II contributes to theory by supporting the tenets of the AMO Framework. Unlike prior research that focused on short-term financial outcomes, this study used RI and II as alternate indicators of organizational performance. Our study expanded the literature into the services sector. Furthermore, we contributed to the methodology by conceptualizing HPWS as a high-order formative construct, resulting in significant model parsimony. Insights from our study are relevant to managers because it shows that HPWS implementation not only helps banks to attract, develop, and retain talent but also facilitates the development of SC, which is critical for enabling the innovation capability of the firm. Top managers need to consider internal SC in the design of HPWS because carefully designed HPWS drives SC. This enables idiosyncratic relationships among members of the organization. Thus, the firm gets a competitive advantage that is harder to be copied by competitors. First, data were collected from a single industry. It will be useful to know the effects of multiple industries in future research. Second, this study did not differentiate between different dimensions of SC, i.e., structural, cognitive, and relational. It will be interesting to see how these dimensions relate to HPWS and innovation in future research.

AB  - Accurate burning state recognition plays an important role in rotary kiln sintering process control. In order to avoid significant discrepancy between human feedback cognitive mechanisms and traditional open-loop recognition methods, a novel intelligent cognitive model based on a variable granularity simulated feedback mechanism is explored in this paper, where evaluation indexes of cognitive results are established to freely regulate cognitive granularity, and the variable granularity simulated feedback mechanism is constructed to update cognitive features and cognitive rules with different granularities. The proposed cognitive model is applied to improve burning state recognition accuracy. With the initial granularity, a burning state recognition decision information system is developed using extracted flame image features. Random vector functional-linker (RVFL) network ensembles are employed to build the initial burning state recognition rules. By using cognitive errors and granularity transformation rules, a heuristic feedback mechanism is proposed to update the decision information system and recognition rules. The experimental results show that our method is effective and outperforms other open-loop recognition techniques.

AB  - Research has clearly established that intelligence is one of the most important individual differences in human resource management (HR) and industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology. Despite its importance and the dramatic changes that have occurred in the world of work, the conceptualization and use of intelligence in workplace processes have changed very little over the past sixty years. In many other fields (e.g., cognitive and developmental psychology, and the neurosciences) researchers have made considerable progress in understanding this critical and complex construct and its role in the modern world. These developments have not only propelled our thinking about intelligence forward, but have also led to the reconsideration of a number of “truths” about intelligence. However, this modern research and thinking has minimally impacted the fields of HR and I/O psychology. The goal of this special issue is to introduce HR and I/O researchers and practitioners to modern thinking on intelligence as well as some of the innovations and developments in the conceptualization, use, and measurement of intelligence that have the potential to impact practice and research in the workplace.

AB  - Decision making in engineering represents a highly complex and therefore challenging process for the involved stakeholders. The high complexity emerges from the combination of a multitude of factors that have to be considered simultaneously within a decision situation. Hereby the factors examined represent decision situation and human (decision-maker) attributes. To help decision-makers in dealing with highly complex decisions several decision support tools, methods and systems (DSS) have been developed. One main disadvantage of DSS is the little adaptation to and integration of user needs and attributes. This paper aims in providing a multilevel stepwise approach for the management of human and decision situation attribute complexity in order to enable a more effective decision support. The decision support is tailored to adapt to decision makers individually and therefore a higher acceptance and use-rate of DSS can be achieved. The approach was developed using findings from literature research and results from several research projects performed in cooperation with industry partners. The presented procedure represents a main design element of the user-centered DSS currently being developed at the Institute of Product Development.

AB  - Ageing management of critical equipment is essential for major accident hazard prevention. In European Union, the Seveso Directive explicitly refers to equipment ageing and specific procedures and tools have been developed in some countries to verify the adequacy of ageing management plans. Ageing management requires up-to-date knowledge of damage mechanisms, failure rates, and inspection techniques. Although the energy transition is moving towards innovative and low-impact processes, the issue of equipment ageing remains a concern for the future due to several factors as many existing petroleum industries will be kept operating for years and green fuels will partially use existing plants. The use of digital technologies, such as inspection robots and pervasive sensors, is increasing in order to optimize maintenance costs and extend the useful lifetime of critical equipment. This poses challenges for stakeholders in the establishment, control bodies, and competent authorities, which need to effectively manage knowledge in the face of digital and energy transitions. Ontologies represent a fundamental methodology for organizing and integrating information throughout the equipment life cycle. These are beneficial for activities with high cognitive content such as incident analysis, risk assessment, maintenance management, and inspection planning. This work aims to strengthen an ontology for ageing management by making it able to incorporate emerging digital inspection technologies and damage mechanisms related to green fuels; finally, through the developed web-application, the ontology is available to establishment operators and auditors for the evaluation of the adequacy of ageing management.

AB  - This paper takes an interdisciplinary approach to find out what makes the experience of spaces different and how can it be enhanced? Based on a literature review this paper draws on cognitive theory to provide a model for enhancing quality of spatial experiences. The model has three stages: encouraging, enabling, and enclosing. The model asserts that in every enhanced spatial experience the audience gets encouraged at the outset by a variety of strategies such as persuasion, designing for meanings, and including concepts in design. The audience must be then enabled by special means, such as immersive and interactive capabilities of the environment along with its security and safety attributes, to get involved with the spatial experience. Consequently, the experience shifts towards a cognitive level at the enclosing stage, focusing on emotion and engagement. To compose this model, at the very beginning, essential components, dimensions, and elements of experience were identified and defined. Seven selected experts were then informed and asked to decide on the priority of the experience's elements. Finally, selected elements were employed to propose the model for enhancing quality of spatial experiences in the built environment. The proposed model is then followed by an example that clarifies how the film industry could apply the model to enhance the quality of spatial experience in the built environment of a movie theatre.

AB  - Underground space is being diversified for more and more functions, including industrial, commercial, transport, educational, and recreational uses. Mixed-use complexes and multi-functional hubs are also being developed underground. As more uses are found for underground space, we should ensure that underground working does not affect human psychology and health. Previous research has examined psychological, health and social aspects associated with underground spaces but mainly employing relatively mono-disciplinary approaches and methodologies, many times in a non-systematic way. Additionally, research up to now has not employed the modern research tools that cognitive neuroscience, experimental social psychology and epidemiology offer. Our research project examines human health, behavior and attitude aspects related to the underground working environment in a multi-disciplinary and holistic way. The overall aim is to examine and address possible psychological and health-related impacts and to enhance social acceptance of underground workspaces. This project begins a unified, systematic and holistic examination of the interaction of human psychology and health with underground spaces to improve public acceptance of underground work. In this study, we present the key elements of a systematic research program examining the relationship between environmental and architectural characteristics of underground spaces with human behavior, cognition and well-being. Initial findings of the research plan show a multi-faceted set of aspects that can affect underground work, from psychological effects on work performance and creativity, social effects on cooperative and risk taking behaviors, health effects, and engineering parameters such as the aesthetic appearance of the space. Problems can arise from the design of underground workspaces, such as disruption from regular exposure to the outdoor environment. Social beliefs, attitudes and cultural meanings can affect the willingness to work underground. The confined environment that is created can amplify issues that are common to all workplaces, including environmental, emotional and motivational factors.

AB  - Companies in different industries are all facing the same challenge: demographic change. When designing workstations for elderly workers, it is necessary to take into account age-related changes in physical and sensory skills as well as in cognitive or mental capabilities. Although extensive data regarding age-related changes are available in the literature, there is a lack of knowledge on how to prepare for an ageing workforce in many companies. Further, age-related declines are mostly not taken into account in workstation design, hence being a reason for physical overload and sick leave. Thus the identification, assessment, and reduction of physical stress takes on a high priority and is the basis for deriving adequate measures given an ageing population. Although the impact of ageing on workplace design is already being researched, there is hardly any research work known that takes into account learning factories as a potential research resource. The aim of this paper is (1) to discuss the influences of demographic change on assembly work, (2) to discuss how learning factories can contribute to solutions and (3) to specify possible contributions of our learning factory within this field. The concepts described are and will be developed and applied in the LEAD factory of the Institute of Innovation and Industrial Management at Graz University of Technology.

However, human safety is the main concern, preventing any fenceless cooperation between humans and industrial robots. This paper presents elements of new strategy for ensuring human safety during various levels of interaction with heavy-load industrial robots. The proposed approach classifies the human–robot interaction (HRI) into four levels. In every level, different kinds of safety functions are developed and analyzed. An additional algorithm has been developed for classifying the dangerous during the interaction. The proposed approach is tested and analyzed on a HRI platform.

AB  - This paper discusses the utilization of latent variable modeling related to occupational health and safety in the mining industry. Latent variable modeling, which is a statistical model that relates observable and latent variables, could be used to facilitate researchers’ understandings of the underlying constructs or hypothetical factors and their magnitude of effect that constitute a complex system. This enhanced understanding, in turn, can help emphasize the important factors to improve mine safety. The most commonly used techniques include the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the structural equation model with latent variables (SEM). A critical comparison of the three techniques regarding mine safety is provided. Possible applications of latent variable modeling in mining engineering are explored. In this scope, relevant research papers were reviewed. They suggest that the application of such methods could prove useful in mine accident and safety research. Application of latent variables analysis in cognitive work analysis was proposed to improve the understanding of human-work relationships in mining operations.

AB  - Health information technology (IT) is a promising way to achieve safer medication management in the delivery of healthcare. However, human factors/ergonomics dictates that in order to make the complex, cognitive work of healthcare delivery safer, health IT must properly support human cognition. This means, for example, that new health IT must reduce, not increase, workload during safety-critical tasks. The present study was the first to quantitatively assess the short- and long-term impact of bar coded medication administration (BCMA) IT on nurses' mental workload as well as on perceived medication safety. One-hundred seventy registered nurses across 3 dissimilar clinical units at an academic, freestanding pediatric hospital in the Midwest US participated in surveys administered before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the hospital implemented BCMA. Nurses rated their external mental workload (interruptions, divided attention, being rushed) and internal mental workload (concentration, mental effort) during medication administration tasks as well as the likelihood of each of three medication safety events: medication administration errors, medication errors on the clinical unit, and clinical unit-level adverse drug events. Clinical unit differences were assessed. Findings generally confirmed the hypothesis that external but not internal mental workload was associated with the perceived likelihood of a medication safety event. Comparisons of mental workload from pre- to post-BCMA revealed statistically significant changes in the critical care unit only. Medication safety appeared to improve over the long term in the hematology/oncology unit only. In the critical care and medical/surgical units, medication safety exhibited short-term improvements that were eliminated over time. Changes in mental workload and medication safety, two classically microergonomic constructs, were deeply embedded in macroergonomic phenomena. These included the fit between the BCMA system and the nature of nursing work, the process of BCMA implementation, and BCMA interactions with concurrent changes occurring in the hospital. Findings raise questions about achieving sustainable performance improvement with health IT as well as the balance between micro- and macroergonomic approaches to studying technology change.
Relevance to industry
Designers must consider how technology changes cognitive work, including mental workload. Hospitals and other implementers of technology must ensure that new technology fits its users, their tasks, and the context of use, which may entail tailoring implementation, for example, to specific clinical units. Evaluators must look over time to assess both changes in cognitive work and implementation issues. Healthcare practitioners must also recognize that new technology means a complex transformation to an already complex sociotechnical system, which calls for a macroergonomic approach to design and analysis.

Organized as a “state-owned, industrial and commercial enterprise”, EPM has established itself at the forefront of the sector. Since late 2012, the EPM Group has been remodeling itself “in line with a new strategic direction for the 10.583 family members who are beneficiaries of a set of services for health and safety within a framework of prevention and promotion as a strategy to improve quality of life.” Through human development and occupational risk and welfare, this example of EPM's business commitment is expressed in a series of actions and services for integral development, carried out through programs that focus on physical/recreational, intellectual, spiritual, social and cognitive components. Particularly significant is the physical activity program, created as a strategy model for health in the workplace. The program extends to the family group (beneficiaries), with an emphasis on how the benefits of sports and physical exercise can improve performance at work, as well as constituting a healthy lifestyle habit. A relationship between ergonomics and prevention is also established as a way to facilitate the creation of a culture of self-care.

Due to a high product variety the instruction quality need to be perceptual in order for the operator to make fast and correct decisions. To educate and support personnel making instructions five guidelines that support operators’ cognitive abilities have been developed. The guidelines were tested in three case studies with three different used groups: production technicians, students from higher vocational education and bachelor students. Results indicate that the theory behind the instructions is useful and valuable and that further development and testing is needed. The main thing both technicians and students learnt was to support the active cognitive processes, that instructions should be picture based and be as simple as possible.

AB  - Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) trainings are used by global industries to mitigate risks and are often provided in a lingua franca (often English). This research investigated a strategy for overcoming language barriers associated with performance, comprehension, and training effectiveness. Non-linguistic (e.g., EU's Napo animated trainings) and English language (ENG) versions of EHS training were compared for effectiveness with native English language participants (L1), non-native English language participants (L2), and non-English language participants (L0). In the 1st study, 102 L1 & L2 U.S. employees completed one of the two trainings and were assessed on their reaction to and comprehension of the training. For this study, ENG was more effective and preferred by both language groups and this may be due to the workers' English proficiency and the number of channels of communication provided by the training medium. In the 2nd study, 78 L0 Brazilian and Chinese employees completed trainings and were assessed identically to the 1st study. For these participants, Napo training was more effective and preferred by both groups and this was likely because ENG L0 trainees had no channels for processing the information versus Napo's single channel of information. Interestingly, Brazilians in the ENG group outperformed their Chinese counterparts. Conversely, Chinese in the Napo group outperformed Brazilians in the Napo group. Though these findings are somewhat intuitive, they are extremely important for two reasons: 1) there is remarkable dearth of empirical research regarding the effects of the use of lingua franca for safety training. 2) Even though the idea of using lingua franca for training with L0 workers may seem obvious, there are a large number of international companies that use this for their EHS training. The findings from this study may provide a more effective and affordable method for some of these companies’ safety training needs.

AB  - With the vigorous development of the information technology industry, the information data available to mankind has shown an explosive growth trend. Dynamic concept learning is an approach that can effectively process the acquired massive data and extract valuable information from them. Concept cognitive learning (CCL) is a very active research direction in the field of dynamic concept learning, while partial order formal structure analysis (POFSA) is a concrete and practical model of CCL. However, the existing CCL algorithms in POFSA face some challenges when processing constantly changing data. Therefore, this paper is devoted to explore an incremental CCL algorithm based on three-way object partial order structure diagram (OPOSD) in POFSA with the incorporation of the thoughts of incremental learning. The features of five object categories are considered, and their incremental influences on three-way OPOSD are analyzed and their incremental CCL algorithms in three-way OPOSD are established. Based on some real famous formal contexts, this paper conducts numerical experiments, and the results show that the incremental CCL algorithm based on three-way OPOSD is consistent with human cognitive principles, and can improve the CCL performance of POFSA as well.

AB  - The current Hong Kong construction industry safety state of affairs are undesirable. While a myriad of safety approaches have been adopted in the industry through normative compliance, error prevention, and climate intervention, the situations remain dismal. One of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of these approaches to ensure construction projects’ safety performance is the mismatch between the approaches’ rigid and static formulations of construction operations that are put to use in the operations that are emergent and dynamic. We propose that the deficiency can be rectified through the project team adaptive inputs and interactions that are grounded in the project team social capital. We (1) explore such possibility by establishing the theoretical underpinning through extant literature and (2) propose a conceptual framework befitting a relational approach to ensuring project safety outcomes. To accomplish the objectives set forth above, we conduct literature search and review in the domains of social capital, construction safety, social psychology, and small team research. Through the process of convergent and refinement of the literary domains, we put forth a conceptual framework that can be put into empirical test. The framework reveals that project team social capital can be modeled as a multi-level phenomenon emanating from individual level network structure. These structural features, together with the relational and cognitive features at the group level, influence the individual safety behaviors, and in turn, their safety outcomes. The analysis through literature review and modeling have shown that project team members’ safety behaviors are influenced by the interaction of both the individual and group level relational phenomena. This study enriches current safety research agenda by highlighting the effects of team dynamics in safety performance. In this respect, we also provide methodological suggestions to empirically test the framework.

AB  - In most studies on Kansei, the product form analysis model is based on the external features or elements of the product components. However, such an approach cannot completely convert consumer emotional perceptions into design elements. Therefore, this study combined the ergonomic technology used in Kansei engineering with the unique cognitive ability of humans to identify patterns and establish an emotional perception model that can integrate the overall interrelations of the constituent elements. Steering wheel design was used as the object of examination. Three types of adjectives were applied to describe the constituent elements. The first type was esthetic factors and involve external esthetics. The second type comprised two pairs of adjectives, sturdy/delicate and lightweight/heavy, called operational strength factors because they relate to form and strength. The third type comprised simplistic/changeful and artificial/spontaneous, called modernity factors because they pertain to the modern sense of beauty of the parts. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to construct a Kansei engineering model and compare the performance of individual elements and the product as a whole. The results show that the R2 values in the overall model were greater than those in the element-oriented model, indicating that the integrated model outperformed the element-oriented model in variance explanation. The differences between the numerical values of the adjective pairs classic/fashionable (esthetic factors), sturdy/delicate (operational strength factors), and simplistic/changeful and artificial/spontaneous (modernity factors) were significant, demonstrating that the overall model is useful in predicting how consumers make assessments according to emotional perceptions. The R2 increase of the modernity factors was the most obvious, indicating that the overall model assesses modernity more accurately. Comparing results and verifying test samples demonstrated that the overall model is more useful in predicting consumer appraisals that are based on emotional perception.
Relevance to industry
This study determined that esthetics, operational strength, and modernity are the three most crucial factors in the emotional perceptions and preferences of consumer regarding steering wheel design. The results demonstrate that a model that integrates constituent elements can evaluate consumer behavior and assist product designers in understanding consumers.

AB  - The selection of alerts within an industrial plant is not an easy task, due to the huge amount of variables involved. By this fact, it is necessary to have the means to easiest the acquirement of necessary information throughout the extraction of the knowledge in order to assist operator in the decision-making process. In this sense, a context-sensitive recommendation system can identify a situation from patterns of events. From the recognition of a situation in a particular ontological context, a proactive approach based on knowledge seems to be more effective for this task. The industrial alarm management system, generally used in supervision systems and process controls, has a problem related to the cognitive overload of their operators. Unfortunately, this occurs mainly during perturbations in the process. In this context, this work aims to investigate and develop methods to adopt proper actions sensitive to the present situation in an industrial alarm management system through semantic web technology and machine learning techniques. This problem involves questions related to the way of obtaining the context data, the context model that describes the situation and the way in which the context data of the plant are related, which allows to infer a situation. In this sense, it is proposed the appliance of data mining techniques to obtain knowledge of the process, taken into consideration an adaptive interface that makes non-intrusive recommendations and help the operator in an industrial plant. To combine deterministic knowledge with probabilistic knowledge, a Bayesian Networks is used. For the concept evaluation, a case study was conducted based on a real historical database, which shows sound and promising results.

AB  - For Internet of Things (IoT) applications the interaction between heterogeneous objects, is mainly constrained by problems of interoperability, security and confidentiality. These issues are often related to classes of applications, and may limit scalability due to increase of connected things. A new approach to handle IoT device interactions has emerged known as Social Internet of Things (SIoT). It aims to provide socio inspired relationship between objects coming from social human behavior theories. The SIoT paradigm opens new perspectives to manage object interactions, with opportunities to extend the functionalities of Industrial IoT devices (IIoT) beyond the existing deterministic and constrained mechanisms that drive current industrial communications. By taking into account current research works, this paper contributes to the field by proposing a solid reference architecture for a Social Communicating Industrial Object, along with its associated properties and its socio-related interaction protocols. It aims at supporting a fully computerized management of social interaction between industrial assets. The potential application of SIoT paradigm in an industrial study case is analyzed, and the impacts are considered on product, resource and monetization of services.

AB  - Due to the increasing complexity in socioeconomic environments and the fuzziness in human cognition, the cognitive information over alternatives provided by a decision organization consisting of several experts is usually uncertain and hesitant. Consequently, in order to solve the fuzziness and uncertainty of preference information in the matching process of complex product manufacturing tasks on the cloud manufacturing platform, a novel two-sided matching model based on dual hesitant fuzzy preference information is proposed. Firstly, the two-sided matching problem and the dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) are described. Then, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is constructed and normalized according to the preference information provided by agents on both sides. Sequentially, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is transformed into the satisfaction degree matrix by the projection technology. Simultaneously, considering the stable matching constraint, a multi-objective two-sided matching optimization model which maximizes the satisfaction degree and minimizes the difference degree of two-sided agents is established. Further, the matching relative competition degree is used to convert the multi-objective optimization model into a single-objective optimization model, and the matching algorithm is designed for solving the model. Moreover, an illustrative example is employed to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the developed model. Subsequently, the sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the stability of the proposed matching results, and the comparative analysis is carried out to illustrate the reliability of the proposed matching algorithm and the merits of the developed model. It reveals that the proposed model can not only obtain stable matching results but also give more choices in matching methods.

After considering the framework’s origins, this paper reviews its progress, predictably covering experimental research on ecological interface design, case studies of the application of CWA to human factors and engineering problems in industry, and methods and modelling tools for CWA. Emphasis is placed, however, on studying the nexus between some of the recent results obtained with CWA and the original field studies of human problem-solving that motivated the framework’s development. Of particular interest is a case study of the use of CWA for military doctrine development, a problem commonly regarded as lying outside the fields of human factors and engineering. It is concluded that the value of CWA, even for such diverse problems, is likely to result from its conceptual grounding in empirical observations of patterns of human reasoning in complex systems.

AB  - Most of the world’s most advanced defense technologies are robots, and the defence industry is slowly moving toward including AI in the military robots they build. For these smart robots to make their own decisions about where to go and what to do, they need to be limited by several algorithms that run continuously and at the same time. Autonomy is the range of automated systems that can be adapted to a specific mission, residual risk, and level of team cohesion between humans and robots. Self-driving robotic systems should be collaborative, which means they should be able to interact actively with humans in a shared space or in proximity to humans and robots. Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC) works better when these COBOTs are aware of their surroundings. Mobile Robot (MR) teams whose perceptual and cognitive abilities are very well developed can help a lot with context awareness. To work well with humans, these robots should know what is going on with their human and other robot teammates so they can make decisions on their own. Also, robots should be able to share information about their surroundings so that humans can benefit from a better understanding of the situation. At the same time, humans should be able to see what the robots are doing. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based framework for humans and robots to work together to understand the context of Defense missions. An ontological model of contexts for missions, agents, and situations; a knowledge base comprising all the tools necessary for a sort of situation; and an efficient and reliable method of collaborative learning are some of its main contributions. The framework works well in terms of how long it takes for people to talk to each other. As the team continues to expand, it can also easily manage communication challenges and a widely differing event frequency range.

AB  - Telecom operators have applied the cell association and load balancing technique with femtocell (HeNB) in urban dense 5G Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) for reducing loads of macrocells (MeNBs) and improving the total capacity. However, this deployment creates an interference scenario; mainly, the problem occurs severely from the users of the connected and autonomous vehicle in MeNBs coverage to HeNBs coverage. The main reason is that deploying HeNBs in MeNBs applies the co-subchannels by HeNB and MeNB, leading to severe cross-tier interference (CSI) in the OFDMA subcarrier. Due to this CSI occurrence, the spectral efficiency, Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR), and system outages affect severely. As a result, the MeNB User Equipment (MUEs) and HeNB User Equipment (HUEs) suffer from service disruption, and the entire system’s performance degrades. This challenge has attracted the attention of many researchers and the telecom industries. As a result, several interferences controlling methods such as enhanced frequency allocation strategies, power management, control technique, resource scheduling, spectrum sharing, and Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques have been suggested for 5G communications. However, the study suggests that downlink interference is still challenging in dense urban zones, especially in multilevel and high-rise complex buildings. This paper proposes the EBBDSA-CSI technique where a novel Evolutionary Biogeography-based Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation (EBBDSA) algorithm is introduced for reducing the cross-tier Subcarriers interference (CSI) issues in MeNB and HeNB. The system-level simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm reduces the system outage to 88.1%, and total spectral efficiency achieves 83.6% compared to the existing techniques.

AB  - In today's market, every product seems to be marked by the label of "experience". It is expected that successful products give the consumer "extraordinary experiences". The research in consumption experience is growing, but much work still needs to be done to understand the food and beverage experience. A qualitative study was conducted using contextual focus groups to explore the building blocks of consumers' drinking experience of industrial and craft beers. The results show that drinking experience is shaped by our cognitive, sensory or affective systems, especially during the core consumption experience. Elements such as attitudes, consumption habits, and individual versus social consumption, shopping experience and product benefits are also responsible for shaping the experience, but are more relevant during the pre-consumption or post-consumption experience. Gender differences occur more frequently in the affective experience, as women search more for relaxation while men for excitement and stimulation while drinking beer. When comparing industrial users versus craft, in the latter the cognitive and shopping experiences are more relevant. Overall, the results showed that the drinking experience of beers can be studied as a function of the salient human system used during product interaction, and this systems act as the building blocks of the drinking experience of beer. This information can be applied in consumer research studies to further study the experiential differences across products and consumers.

KW  - Low carbon development
KW  - Social contract
KW  - Great transformation towards sustainability
AB  - The transition to a low carbon and sustainable economy represents a major transformation that can only be compared to one other comprehensive transition in modern human history: the industrial revolution. Like the low-carbon transformation, the process of industrialisation was above all an energy regime change. However, industrialisation cannot be solely reduced to a fundamental change in the energy system. The “global methamorphosis” towards industrial societies was driven by economic, cultural and social processes progressing at different speeds. Transformations are actually the result of “Häufigkeitsverdichtungen von Veränderungen” (Osterhammel, 2009), a concurrence of multiple changes. The non-linearity of far-reaching transformations becomes particularly apparent in the non-parallelism between the history of ideas and real socio-economic changes. The social, cultural and cognitive “software” of modern societies was already developed by the thinkers of the Enlightenment. The concept of “Sustainability” follows very similar trajectories. Against this background the concept of a social contract for sustainability gains relevance. It symbolises that the transformation to sustainability implies a fundamental realignment of societies, which requires the legitimation of their citizens. In the last part of his paper the author describes emerging pillars for the social contract of sustainability. An optimistic interpretation of these trends would be: although global emissions are still rising, in many societies the cognitive, normative and cultural conditions for a sustainability transformation are now being established.

AB  - The objective of this research is to achieve innovation with a disruptive edge in a human-driven operational environment where layering key information is critical to the customer's current story-boarding solution space. However, new online video data sources present an increasing complexity, with visual cues trapped in hours of video data with no automated means to easily locate and extract key data nuggets. The solution is the introduction of disruptive concepts with an ‘operational experimentation’ focus to mimic the customer's approach. This new method will embrace the larger ‘tell me a story’ perceptive approach to automate the process of building a user defined text story representation based on the accurate discovery / identification of relevant content in the online videos. This paper will cover overall components of the operational experimentation methodology which is part of a long-term (12-24 month) software research and development (R&D) prototyping strategy to operationalize software through a customer driven partnership. This methodology borrows ideas from multiple disciplines including cognitive ergonomics, computer science and industrial engineering. This case study emphasizes the importance of incorporating how humans cognitively process film based stimulation as a ‘story’, to design a system that will assist humans by automating the processing of online social media based video streams and imagery. The significance of this work demonstrates a paradigm shift in how automated video analysis is designed and accomplished through sharing pros and cons of selecting and operationally testing analytics through a series of vignettes. Beginning with an on-line video and concluding with a text based story of that video that is now searchable, understandable, and available to traditional cloud based analytics tailored to an organization's particular needs. This paper will include the results of the customer's experience through the seven stages of the operational experimentation process for Phase 1 of system development.

AB  - One challenge that has received attention in maritime industry is assessing the risk level of dynamic positioning (DP) systems in emergency situations. Statistics from recent years have shown that the risk level of some DP operations is above the industry's risk criteria. Operators have a significant impact on incidents’ consequences by making responsive decisions. In emergencies, one is afforded little time to make a decision. Available risk models are not efficient enough to provide systems’ risk level in a short period of time. In this study, the application of a new supervised methodology to assist decision making in emergencies is proposed. This method significantly reduces the processing and execution time of a system's probabilistic risk assessment models. In this methodology, the most probable failure scenarios are generated using an optimization model. The objective of the optimization model in this study is to find scenarios with the highest occurrence probabilities. The constraints are a system's dynamic simulation and its risk model. The proposed method is applied to three incidents that occurred in the Norwegian offshore sector in previous years. The results show that the model can predict the most probable scenarios with an acceptable accuracy in a very short time.

AB  - Software defect prevention is an important way to reduce the defect introduction rate. As the primary cause of software defects, human error can be the key to understanding and preventing software defects. This paper proposes a defect prevention approach based on human error mechanisms: DPeHE. The approach includes both knowledge and regulation training in human error prevention. Knowledge training provides programmers with explicit knowledge on why programmers commit errors, what kinds of errors tend to be committed under different circumstances, and how these errors can be prevented. Regulation training further helps programmers to promote the awareness and ability to prevent human errors through practice. The practice is facilitated by a problem solving checklist and a root cause identification checklist. This paper provides a systematic framework that integrates knowledge across disciplines, e.g., cognitive science, software psychology and software engineering to defend against human errors in software development. Furthermore, we applied this approach in an international company at CMM Level 5 and a software development institution at CMM Level 1 in the Chinese Aviation Industry. The application cases show that the approach is feasible and effective in promoting developers’ ability to prevent software defects, independent of process maturity levels.

AB  - Over the years, safety in maritime industries has been reinforced by many state-of-the-art technologies. However, the accident rate hasn’t dropped significantly with the advanced technology onboard. The main cause of this phenomenon is human errors which drive researchers to study human factors in the maritime domain. One of the key factors that contribute to human performance is their mental states such as cognitive workload and stress. In this paper, we propose and implement an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based psychophysiological evaluation system to be used in maritime virtual simulators for monitoring, training and assessing the seafarers. The system includes an EEG processing part, visualization part, and an evaluation part. By using the processing part of the system, different brain states including cognitive workload and stress can be identified from the raw EEG data recorded during maritime exercises in the simulator. By using the visualization part, the identified brain states, raw EEG signals, and videos recorded during the maritime exercises can be synchronized and displayed together. By using the evaluation part of the system, an indicative recommendation on “pass”, “retrain”, or “fail” of the seafarers’ performance can be obtained based on the EEG-based cognitive workload and stress recognition. Detailed analysis of the demanding events in the maritime tasks is provided by the system for each seafarer that could be used to improve their training. A case study is presented using the proposed system. EEG data from 4 pilots were recorded when they were performing maritime tasks in the simulator. The data are processed and evaluated. The results show that one pilot gets a “pass” recommendation, one pilot gets a “retrain” recommendation, and the other two get “fail” results regarding their performance in the simulator.

AB  - The emergence of new visualization technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) had been widely implemented in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Although cumulative evidence pointed out a positive impact of these visualization technologies on construction task performance, there is still an obvious disagreement on the benefits or implications of these new visualization technologies, due to the lack of understanding of the mechanisms in which the visualization affects cognitive processes related to information processing. To obtain more evidence, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 90) to investigate the impact of information format on the performance of an industrial pipeline maintenance task. The investigation centers around how different engineering information formats affect the attention patterns as a potential explanation for the changes in performance. A between-group experiment design was used where the participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups (2D group, 3D group, and VR group) depending on what type of information was given to review the pipe operation instruction. After the review session, the participants were asked to perform the operation task in the virtual environment based on their memory. The results showed that the 3D and VR groups outperformed the 2D group in task performance. The analysis of eye-tracking data further indicated that the information format significantly changed the gaze scanning pattern when participants were reviewing the operational instructions. We also found that the task performance was correlated with eye-tracking features including gaze movement and pupil dilation. Our findings provided more evidence about the mechanisms in which new visualization technologies affect the attention patterns, helped resolve the current disagreement within the literature. In addition, a prediction model was proposed to use eye-tracking features to predict construction task performance.

AB  - This research explores the socio-cognitive mechanisms of human intelligence through the lens of anthropomorphic, xˆenocentric, intentional, and social (AXˆIS) robotics. After delving into three pivotal AXˆIS concepts – robotic anthropomorphism, intentionality, and sociality – the study examines their impact on robot likeability and successful human-robot interaction (HRI) implementation. The research introduces the concept of robotic xˆenocentrism (represented by perceived inferiority and social aggrandizement) as a new global dimension in social robotics literature, positioning it as a higher-order concept that moderates the impact of pivotal independent variables on robot likeability. Analyzing a sample of 308 respondents in global cross-cultural teams, the study confirms that pivotal AXÍS robotics concepts foster positive robot likeability and successful HRI implementation for both industrial and social robots. Perceived inferiority negatively moderated the relationship between anthropomorphism and robot likeability, but it was a positive moderator between intentionality and robot likeability. However, social aggrandizement did not act as a significant boundary condition. Sociality remains unaffected by the moderating influence of xˆenocentrism. The study concludes by outlining future research directions for AXˆIS robotics.

AB  - In recent years, with the popularization of 3D-CAD, various curved surface shapes have been used in the styling of industrial products. However, evaluation and control of shape features are done in trial and error based on the experience and intuition of the designer, causing the inefficiency of styling design. Therefore, this study aims to support the styling design by quantifying cognitive characteristics in curved surface shape. First, this research proposed total absolute curvature to quantify “complexity”, which is one of the shape features related to “beauty”, and described its geometric meaning as the total area of the Gauss map on the curved surface shape. Next, the tangible calculation method is shown by applying it to the curved surface shape represented by a triangular polygon mesh. Then, sensory evaluation experiments were carried out using three types of shapes generated by extrusion, rotation, and emergent shape generation system to confirm the applicability of the proposed quantification method. Finally, the result revealed that the logarithmic approximation between the proposed index and human perceived “complexity”.

AB  - Context:
eHealth apps are mobile apps that help in self-management of critical illnesses, provide home-based disease management, and help with personalized care. Users of eHealth apps are naturally very diverse in terms of their human aspects, e.g., their age, gender, emotional reactions to the apps, cognitive style, physical and mental challenges. Unfortunately, many eHealth apps do not take these user differences sufficiently into account, making them ineffective or even unusable.
Objective:
This paper reports a study from eHealth app stakeholders’ – developers and end-users – perspectives on critical challenges and benefits of better incorporating human aspects into eHealth app development and usage. We also investigate how different human aspects are being addressed by developers, which ones are the most important for different user groups, and which ones are currently missing/poorly handled.
Method:
A mixed-method approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative research was used for this study. We gathered and analyzed data from 240 online survey responses and 25 detailed interviews within the same study and validated the results.
Results:
We report key issues encountered in eHealth app design, difficulty in addressing different human aspects, areas requiring further research and practical assistance, and recommend our findings to best address these challenges. We found addressing human aspects throughout the app development life-cycle is beneficial for more effective eHealth apps. Our findings also suggest the need for improved standards and guidelines, better developer-user collaborative culture, and better human aspects education to produce more effective eHealth apps.
Conclusion:
This paper investigates current approaches used in the eHealth app domain that take into account the human aspects of app users. The paper guides eHealth app stakeholders, future researchers, academia and industry partners be aware of human aspects related challenges and improve produce apps.

AB  - Over the past years, supply chains have become more complex, widespread, and interlinked – in particular, due to increasing digitalization. Nevertheless, companies face substantial maturity differences regarding the implementation of digitalization technologies, which causes several risks for buyer-supplier relationships (BSRs). Managing these risks within BSRs requires human decision-making in various steps. However, research shows that human decisions are often biased which can negatively affect risk management. We contribute to this issue by combining a systematic literature review on I4.0 maturity in BSRs and cognitive biases with practice insights from discussions with experts to derive first guidelines for supplier risk management, considering I4.0 maturity differences.

AB  - With a value-sensitive approach in mind, a theoretical and empirical analysis was conducted and reported here to explain the factors that influence potential user adoption of cloud computing by integrating quality factors as well as cognitive motivations as primary determining factors. The factors are explored as human values and the methodology how designers should take these values into account is examined. The results show that user intentions and behaviors are largely influenced by the perceived values of cloud services, which include availability, access, security and reliability. These values were found to be the significant antecedents of usefulness and ease of use in cloud computing. Theoretically, the model proposed in this paper advances the existing technology acceptance models and can be used to predict the acceptance and diffusion of cloud computing. Practically, the findings should guide the government and industry promoting cloud services to increase user acceptance by enhancing user experience and ensuring security.

AB  - This paper describes a distributed collaborative effort between industry and academia to systematize data management in an academic biomedical laboratory. Heterogeneous and voluminous nature of research data created in biomedical laboratories make information management difficult and research unproductive. One such collaborative effort was evaluated over a period of four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in biomedical laboratories. Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system. Technology transfer experience in a complex environment such as the biomedical laboratory can be eased with use of information systems that support human and cognitive interoperability. Such informatics features can also contribute to successful collaboration and hopefully to scientific productivity.

AB  - Much research on modeling human performance associated with visual perception is formulated by schematic models based on neural mechanisms or cognitive architectures. But, these two modeling paradigms are limited in the domains of multiple monitor environments. Although the schematic model based on neural mechanisms can represent human visual systems in multiple monitor environments by providing a detailed account of eye and head movements, these models cannot easily be applied in complex cognitive interactions. On the other hand, the cognitive architectures can model the interaction of multiple aspects of cognition, but these architectures have not focused on modeling the visual orienting behavior of eye and head movements. Thus, in this study, a specific cognitive architecture, which is ACT-R, is extended by an existing schematic model of human visual systems based on neural mechanisms in order to model human performance in multiple monitor environments more accurately. And, this study proposes a method of modeling human performance using the extended ACT-R. The proposed method is validated by an experiment, confirming that the proposed method is able to predict human performance more accurately in multiple monitor environments.
Relevance to industry
Predicting human performance with a computational model can be used as an alternative method to implementing iterative user testing for developing a system interface. The computational model in this study can predict human performance in multiple monitor environments, so that the model can be applied early on in the design phase, to evaluate the system interface in multiple monitor environments.

AB  - Industrial passive low-back exoskeletons have gained recent attention as ergonomic interventions to manual handling tasks. This research utilized a two-armed experimental approach (single vs dual-task paradigms) to quantify neural and biomechanical tradeoffs associated with short-term human-exoskeleton interaction (HEI) during asymmetrical lifting in twelve healthy adults balanced by gender. A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate dual-task manipulations.

A deep understanding of inspectors' cognition and actions in the wild may establish the requirements to develop intelligent automation that truly enhances their perceptual, cognitive and social abilities. This paper takes a two-pronged approach to uncover and model the complexity of industrial inspection in a manner that aligns with the technical development stages of a Cyber-Physical-Social System. The findings offer thick descriptions accompanied by four descriptive empirical models that depict inspectors' meaning-making and decision-making processes. It includes how they gather, process, and apply domain-specific knowledge to diagnose a component's condition and how they deal with domain-related factors (norms, institution's rules, standard operating procedures). This study also highlights the support provided by empirical data/models in designers' work packages. It concludes by presenting the design implications of these findings to envision future human-automation work situations.

We manipulated two complexity factors, convergence angle and aircrafts minimum distance at closest approach, in a multidimensional workload assessment method based on psychophysiological, performance, and subjective measures. Conflict trials resulted more complex and time-consuming than no conflicts, requiring more frequent fixations and saccades. Moreover, large saccades showed reduced burst power with higher task complexity. A motion-based and a ratio-based strategy were suggested for conflicts and no conflicts on the basis of ocular metrics analysis: aircrafts differential speed and distance to convergence point at trial start were considered determinant for strategy adoption.
Relevance to industry
Eye metrics measurement for online workload assessment enhances better identification of workload-inducing scenarios and adopted strategy for traffic management. System design, as well as air traffic control operators training programs, might benefit from on line workload measurement.

AB  - Context As autonomous driving technology matures toward series production, it is necessary to take a deeper look at various aspects of electrical/electronic (E/E) architectures for autonomous driving. Objective This paper describes a functional reference architecture for autonomous driving, along with various considerations that influence such an architecture. The functionality is described at the logical level, without dependence on specific implementation technologies. Method Engineering design has been used as the research method, which focuses on creating solutions intended for practical application. The architecture has been refined and applied over a 5 year period to the construction of prototype autonomous vehicles in three different categories, with both academic and industrial stakeholders. Results The architectural components are divided into categories pertaining to (i) perception, (ii) decision and control, and (iii) vehicle platform manipulation. The architecture itself is divided into two layers comprising the vehicle platform and a cognitive driving intelligence. The distribution of components among the architectural layers considers two extremes: one where the vehicle platform is as “dumb” as possible, and the other, where the vehicle platform can be treated as an autonomous system with limited intelligence. We recommend a clean split between the driving intelligence and the vehicle platform. The architecture description includes identification of stakeholder concerns, which are grouped under the business and engineering categories. A comparison with similar architectures is also made, wherein we claim that the presence of explicit components for world modeling, semantic understanding, and vehicle platform abstraction seem unique to our architecture. Conclusion The concluding discussion examines the influences of implementation technologies on functional architectures and how an architecture is affected when a human driver is replaced by a computer. The discussion also proposes that reduction and acceleration of testing, verification, and validation processes is the key to incorporating continuous deployment processes.

AB  - Quality function deployment (QFD) is one of the very effective customer-driven quality system tools typically applied to fulfill customer needs or requirements (CRs). It is a crucial step in QFD to derive the prioritization of design requirements (DRs) from CRs for a product. However, effective prioritization of DRs is seriously challenged due to two types of uncertainties: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. This paper tries to propose a novel two-stage group decision-making approach to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD. The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers’ fuzzy preference relations into an overall one by fuzzy majority. Two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing approaches. Implementation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and model customer heterogeneity and design team’s preference. Due to its easiness, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in QFD planning. Extensions to the proposed approach are also given to address application contexts involving a wider set of HOQ elements.

This mainly concerns the area of industrial production, where the aim is to apply new technologies on the principle of artificial intelligence, using the possibilities of a new direction in the use of a technology called the Internet of Things (IoT). With this idea, however, the question of the user disappears, who in this chaos of massive information can get into a state, where his activities will no longer be manageable. To cope with this situation, it is necessary to examine the impact of these technologies on the quality of life in the work and home environment. This paper investigates process modelling and the creation of predictive models to obtain the emotional state of users. The created predictive models will later allow the simulation of complex sensory systems, which will be able to predict the emotional states of users based on their physiological states. The aim is to also find connections between physiological states and basic emotions to be able to classify user emotions with the highest possible accuracy in the classification process.

AB  - Intelligence amplification systems and technologies have gained significant interest from academia and industry during the past few decades. One of the main reasons behind this trend is the fact that most experts agree that truly intelligent artificial system is yet to be developed. The question increasing often asked is this: Is full replication of human intelligence desirable key aim in intelligence related technology and research? In this context, the concept of Augmented Intelligence, also known as Cognitive Augmentation or Intelligence Amplification (IA) comes into play. One of the main reasons behind this interest in this concept is the potential of such technologies to revolutionize human life as they intend to work under complex decision-making environments, adapting to a comprehensive range of unforeseen changes, and exhibiting prospective behavior. The combination of these properties aims to enhance human capabilities and create more intelligent and efficient human-centered environments. In this paper we discuss how Decisional DNA (DDNA), a multi-domain knowledge structure that has the Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) at its core can be utilized as an experience-based intelligence augmentation in a number of different domains.

AB  - The speed of manufacturing processes today depends on a trade-off between the physical processes of production, the wider system that allows these processes to operate and the co-ordination of a supply chain in the pursuit of meeting customer needs. Could the speed of this activity be doubled? This paper explores this hypothetical question, starting with examination of a diverse set of case studies spanning the activities of manufacturing. This reveals that the constraints on increasing manufacturing speed have some common themes, and several of these are examined in more detail, to identify absolute limits to performance. The physical processes of production are constrained by factors such as machine stiffness, actuator acceleration, heat transfer and the delivery of fluids, and for each of these, a simplified model is used to analyse the gap between current and limiting performance. The wider systems of production require the co-ordination of resources and push at the limits of human biophysical and cognitive limits. Evidence about these is explored and related to current practice. Out of this discussion, five promising innovations are explored to show examples of how manufacturing speed is increasing—with line arrays of point actuators, parallel tools, tailored application of precision, hybridisation and task taxonomies. The paper addresses a broad question which could be pursued by a wider community and in greater depth, but even this first examination suggests the possibility of unanticipated innovations in current manufacturing practices.

AB  - Mobile computing and fast wireless connections are working in tandem to satisfy an inherent human and business continuous growing data demand. Moreover, machine-to-machine communications will further expand the demand to even higher levels. In addition, Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) created-data will contribute to increasing such demand by 100 and possibly 1000 folds. This increase in demand can be supported by densification and expansion of wireless networks. Such expansion poses new challenge on energy efficiency. This paper presents several techniques to enable energy savings for both devices and infrastructure. These techniques are based on cognitive and cooperative concepts to enable low power network acquisition, energy efficient paging, and dynamic/opportunistic network energy savings. A simulation analysis based on the information from a commercially deployed network presents a promising results on the possible infrastructure energy saving gains as well as a seamless location service offering.

AB  - This paper investigates the presence of explicit labour-saving heuristics within robotic patents. It analyses innovative actors engaged in robotic technology and their economic environment (identity, location, industry), and identifies the technological fields more exposed to labour-saving innovations. It exploits advanced natural language processing and probabilistic topic modelling techniques applied to the universe of USPTO patent applications between 2009 and 2018, matched with the ORBIS (Bureau van Dijk) firm-level dataset. The results show that labour-saving patent holders comprise not only robot producers, but mainly adopters. Consequently, labour-saving robotic patents appear along the entire supply chain. Additionally, labour-saving innovations are directed towards manual activities in services (e.g. in the logistics sector), activities entailing social intelligence (e.g. in the healthcare sector) and cognitive skills (e.g. learning and predicting).

KW  - Rationalizing neural prediction
AB  - Text classification is one of the key problems in natural language processing (NLP), and in early years, it was usually accomplished by feature-based machine learning models. Recently, the deep neural network has become a powerful learning machine, making it possible to work with text itself as raw input for the classification problems. However, existing neural networks are typically end-to-end and lack explicit interpretation of the prediction. In this paper, we propose Jumper, a novel framework that models text classification as a sequential decision process. Generally, Jumper is a neural system that scans a piece of text sequentially and makes classification decisions at the time it wishes, which is inspired by the cognitive process of human text reading. In our framework, both the classification result and when to make the classification are part of the decision process, controlled by a policy network and trained with reinforcement learning. Experimental results of real-world applications demonstrate the following properties of a properly trained Jumper: (1) it tends to make decisions whenever the evidence is enough, therefore reducing total text reading by 30–40% and often finding the key rationale of the prediction; and (2) it achieves classification accuracy better than or comparable to state-of-the-art models in several benchmark and industrial datasets. We further conduct a simulation experiment with mock data, which confirms that Jumper is able to make a decision at the theoretically optimal decision position.

AB  - Traditional industrial applications involve robots with limited mobility. Consequently, interaction (e.g. manipulation) was treated separately from whole-body posture (e.g. balancing), assuming the robot firmly connected to the ground. Foreseen applications involve robots with augmented autonomy and physical mobility. Within this novel context, physical interaction influences stability and balance. To allow robots to surpass barriers between interaction and posture control, forthcoming robotic research needs to investigate the principles governing whole-body motion and coordination with contact dynamics. There is a need to investigate the principles of motion and coordination of physical interaction, including the aspects related to unpredictability. Recent developments in compliant actuation and touch sensing allow safe and robust physical interaction from unexpected contact including humans. The next advancement for cognitive robots, however, is the ability not only to cope with unpredictable contact, but also to exploit predictable contact in ways that will assist in goal achievement. Last but not least, theoretical results needs to be validated in real-world scenarios with humanoid robots engaged in whole-body goal-directed tasks. Robots should be capable of exploiting rigid supportive contacts, learning to compensate for compliant contacts, and utilizing assistive physical interaction from humans. The work presented in this paper presents state-of-the-art in these domains as well as some recent advances made within the framework of the CoDyCo European project.

For this reason, the proposed study analyses this system using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps arriving at the formation of a real map of the causal relationships between the concepts identified, then divided by areas of membership. In doing so, the most relevant factors affecting the Green Supply Chain decision-making process have been identified and analysed.

AB  - Many species exploit immediately apparent dimensions of objects during tool use and manufacture and operate over internal perceptual representations of objects (they move and reorient objects in space, have rules of operation to deform or modify objects, etc). Humans, however, actively test for functionally relevant object properties before such operations begin, even when no previous percepts of a particular object's qualities in the domain have been established. We hypothesize that such prospective diagnostic interventions are a human specialization of cognitive function that has been entirely overlooked in the neuropsychological literature. We presented chimpanzees with visually identical rakes: one was functional for retrieving a food reward; the other was non-functional (its base was spring-loaded). Initially, they learned that only the functional tool could retrieve a distant reward. In test 1, we explored if they would manually test for the rakes' rigidity during tool selection, but before using it. We found no evidence of such behavior. In test 2, we obliged the apes to deform the non-functional tool's base before using it, in order to evaluate whether this would cause them to switch rakes. It did not. Tests 3–6 attempted to focus the apes' attention on the functionally relevant property (rigidity). Although one ape eventually learned to abandon the non-functional rake before using it, she still did not attempt to test the rakes for rigidity prior to use. While these results underscore the ability of chimpanzees to use novel tools, at the same time they point toward a fundamental (and heretofore unexplored) difference in causal reasoning between humans and apes. We propose that this behavioral difference reflects a human specialization in how object properties are represented, which could have contributed significantly to the evolution of our technological culture. We discuss developing a new line of evolutionarily motivated neuropsychological research on action disorders.

To respond the growing needs of industrial community, this study apply the cognitive-apprenticeship strategy using various teaching materials, including three-view diagram and tangible 3D materials, in the 3D modeling course. The lag sequential analysis and interviews are adopted to explore the pattern transformation of the learners' meta-cognition behavior during the problem-solving tasks. The results show that different teaching methods and materials lead to differentiated metacognitive behaviors. Moreover, comparing to traditional instruction strategy, using 3D tangible object in cognitive-apprenticeship instruction stimulates more meta-cognition behaviors, further leads to successful problem-solving.

AB  - Owing to the fact that the number and complexity of machines is increasing in Industry 4.0, the maintenance process is more time-consuming and labor-intensive, which contains plenty of refined maintenance operations. Fortunately, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can integrate human intelligence into the collaborative robot (cobot), which can realize not merely the nimble and sapiential maintenance operations of personnel but also the reliable and repeated maintenance manipulation of cobots. However, the existing HRC maintenance lacks the precise understand of the maintenance intention, the efficient HRC decision-making for executing robotized maintenance tasks (e.g., repetitive manual tasks) and the convenient interaction interface for executing cognitive tasks (e.g., maintenance preparation and guidance job). Hence, a mixed perception-based human-robot collaborative maintenance approach consisting of three-hierarchy structures is proposed in this paper, which can help reduce the severity of the mentioned problems. In the first stage, a mixed perception module is proposed to help the cobot recognize human safety and maintenance request according to human actions and gestures separately. During the second stage, an improved online deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making module with the asynchronous structure and the function of anti-disturbance is proposed in this paper, which can realize the execution of robotized maintenance tasks. In the third stage, an augmented reality-assisted (AR) user-friendly interaction interface is designed to help the personnel interact with the cobot and execute the auxiliary maintenance task without the limitation of spatial and human factors. In addition, the auxiliary of maintenance operation can also be supported by the AR-assisted visible guidance. Finally, comparative numerical experiments are implemented in a typical machining workshop, and the experimental results show a competitive performance of the proposed HRC maintenance approach compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - As software-intensive systems become more and more complex, so does the assessment of the risks that these systems may have on people's businesses, privacy, livelihoods, and very lives. For very large long-lived industrial programmes, such as the Galileo programme of the European Space Agency (ESA), or the French Pentagon programme for the Ministry of Defence, traditional risk management approaches are now reaching their limit. This is true for tooling, but even more so for humans. This paper proposes novel techniques to deal with cognitive scalability issues in risk assessment studies, amongst which graphical extensions to traditional risk management approaches, such as chain diagrams, and the seamless integration of attack trees. Feedback and results were collected from security experts and other stakeholders, in a large industrial context (namely, the Galileo risk assessment programme) and through dedicated research and development demonstrations. The feedback and results show effective improvements with respect to standard practices, even though fine tuning is still needed to reach an adequate and financially acceptable equilibrium between: (i) dealing with a large number of small independent problems; and (ii) maintaining an overall understanding of the system’s risks and risks treatment.

AB  - Skills required for non-routine situations are learned in initial training but are rarely applied during work. Such skills decay if they are not rehearsed repeatedly, e.g. in refresher interventions. A promising concept to counteract skill decay is gaze guiding, which has the potential to reduce the consequences of skill decay by means of cued recall. The present study explores whether gaze guiding can be used as an alternative to refresher interventions. Fifty-five participants learned a complex cognitive skill required for a production task. After two weeks, they recalled the initially learned skill either with support of the gaze-guiding tool (Gaze-Guiding group) or without support (Practice-refresher intervention group or Control group). The participants of the Practice-refresher intervention group repeated the initially learned skill in week 2. The results show that gaze guiding supports the precise execution of a task and is a promising technical tool for cued recall and retrieval support.
Relevance to industry
Refresher interventions are popular methods for skill retention. A resource-saving alternative is an adaptive computer-based job aid which supports the operator's skill retrieval in the recall situation. It is a further development of step-by-step guidance with computer-based procedures and appears only when the operator fails to remember the task operation.

AB  - Human reliability analysis (HRA) is used in the context of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) to provide risk information regarding human performance to support risk-informed decision-making with respect to high-reliability industries. The IntegrateD Human Event Analysis System (IDHEAS) is a new HRA method developed for internal, at-power nuclear power plant (NPP) events. It was motivated by the intention to reduce unnecessary and inappropriate variability in HRA results and improve the reliability of human error probability (HEP) estimates. The method has a strong foundation in human performance and cognitive psychology theories, and employs a cause-based quantification model. This paper documents a study conducted to pilot test IDHEAS to (1) identify issues that needed to be addressed and (2) provide feedback to refine the method before the method was finalized. An introduction on IDHEAS is provided first. Then sample IDHEAS analysis results are presented for illustration purposes. Next, insights from the testing in terms of method strengths and weaknesses are discussed, which is followed by concluding remarks.

Although the importance of prevention through design has been argued for many years, the mechanism between design and unsafe behavior is still unclear, which impedes the promotion of design for safety. This study aims to reduce accidents in the construction industry and promote safety design by understanding the mechanism through design leads to unsafe behavior and quantify the probability that design failure will cause unsafe behavior. Real inspection data were combined with a Bayesian network, and Bayesian parameter learning was used to identify how design lead to unsafe behavior and calculate the probability of the unsafe behavior. The result highlighted the significance of engineering design specify the mechanism of design on behavior, which outlined a theoretical foundation for prevention through design.

Interventions intended to improve the situation have largely failed. This is due to a lack of a deep understanding of primary health care. Human Factors approaches and methods will aid in understanding the cognitive, social and technical needs of these specialties, and in designing and testing proposed innovations. In 2012, Ben-Tzion Karsh, Ph.D., conceived a transdisciplinary conference to frame the opportunities for research human factors and industrial engineering in primary care. In 2013, this conference brought together experts in primary care and human factors to outline areas where human factors methods can be applied. The results of this expert consensus panel highlighted four major research areas: Cognitive and social needs, patient engagement, care of community, and integration of care. Work in these areas can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of innovations in Primary Care. We provide descriptions of these research areas, highlight examples and give suggestions for future research.

AB  - Product personality and product usability are two important factors which can influence consumers' product choice. Published literature are available regarding independent impact of product personality and product usability on product choice but no research has been reported so far for understanding their collective influence on product choice. In addition, which factor between usability and product personality contributing more in product choice is still not clear. Current research thus aimed to bridge these research gaps by establishing inter-relationships among product personality, usability and product choice. To achieve this goal, two separate experiments were conducted. Results of first experiment revealed that products having high product usability also possessed strong product personality. Following second experiment, it was observed that solitary influence of product usability on product choice was more than the standalone influence of product personality in human-product physical interaction. Moreover, it unfolded the fact that product usability mediates the influence of product personality towards product choice. Established interrelationships among product personality, usability and product choice, would help designer and ergonomists to decide how product attributes could be manipulated to enhance product personality and/or product usability to ensure product choice.
Relevance to industry
Techniques mentioned in the current paper for product usability/personality assessment, have significant implication in product design. Gained knowledge will be helpful for industrial designer or human factors experts to incorporate various positive product usability attributes to enhance product personality or vice-versa for assuring acceptance of product in market.

AB  - Human computer interaction is increasingly utilized in smart home, industry 4.0 and personal health. Communication between human and computer can benefit by a flawless exchange of emotions. As emotions have substantial influence on cognitive processes of the human brain such as learning, memory, perception and problem solving, emotional interactions benefit different applications. It can further be relevant in modern health care especially in interaction with patients suffering from stress or depression. Additionally rehabilitation applications, guiding patients through their rehabilitation training while adapting to the patients emotional state, would be highly motivating and might lead to a faster recovery. Depending on the application area, different systems for emotion recognition suit different purposes. The aim of this work is to give an overview of methods to recognize emotions and to compare their applicability based on existing studies. This review paper should enable practitioners, researchers and engineers to find a system most suitable for certain applications. An entirely contact-less method is to analyze facial features with the help of a video camera. This is useful when computers, smart-phones or tablets with integrated cameras are included in the task. Smart wearables provide contact with the skin and physiological parameters such as electro-dermal activity and heart related signals can be recorded unobtrusively also during dynamical tasks. Next to unimodal solutions, multimodal affective computing systems are analyzed since they promise higher classification accuracy. Accuracy varies based on the amount of detected emotions, extracted features, classification method and the quality of the database. Electroencephalography achieves 88.86 % accuracy for four emotions, multimodal measurements (Electrocardiography, Electromyography and bio-signals) 79.3 % for four emotive states, facial recognition 89 % for seven states and speech recognition 80.46 % for happiness and sadness. Looking forward, heart-related parameters might be an option to measure emotions accurately and unobtrusive with the help of smart wearables. This can be used in dynamic or outdoor tasks. Facial recognition on the other hand is a useful contact-less tool when it comes to emotion recognition during computer interaction.

AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the effects of interruption task similarity and complexity on performance of a simulated industrial assembly operation. Eighteen participants performed a simulated industrial assembly operation, including one trial with no interruption and eight others presenting an interruption task. Interruption conditions comprised a full crossing of task similarity to the primary assembly operation (similar, dissimilar) and complexity (simple, complex) with replication for each participant. Order of condition presentation was randomized. Findings revealed greater time to return to primary visual-manual assembly performance after a similar task interruption. Results also indicated complex interruptions may promote cognitive arousal that increases productivity following assembly interruptions. The majority of results are explained in terms of the Activation-Based Memory for Goals model. Findings provide some guidance for interruption management protocol design for workers engaged in procedural visual-manual assembly operations.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems lead to an emerging quantity and quality of data that can be collected and processed within the whole production process. [1] This data helps to rationalize and optimize the production planning as well as the operative level. In order to handle this amount of complex information, digital support systems are required. Besides assistant systems, crosslinking of data and machines within a company is one of the central aspects of Industrie 4.0. In a round based training concept the connection between manufacturing execution systems and assistant systems will be explained. Furthermore the changes of work caused by decision support systems as well as the functionalities of assistance systems will be included in the new training concept. Assistant systems can be divided into cognitive and physical assistance. [2] In this article we focus on cognitive assistance. It has perceiving functions and the decision support function because there will be an increasing incidence in the future due to a higher amount of data. To support this theory research results from the project SOPHIE regarding digital and human centered decision support systems will be used. [3] Beside the effects of networking in a company for the employees of production and assembly on the shopfloor the new concept also tries to show the changes on the dispositive level and for employees in the middle management and decision makers.

AB  - To extend the results of a previous study on the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) and bioeffluents on humans, the new study reported in this paper was carried out. The purpose of this study was to examine, whether exposure to CO2 at 5000 ppm would cause sensory discomfort, evoke acute health symptoms, reduce the performance of cognitive tasks, or result in changes in physiological responses. The outdoor air supply rate was set high enough in a low-emission stainless-steel climate chamber to create a reference condition with CO2 at 500 ppm when subjects were present, and chemically pure CO2 was added to the supply air to create an exposure condition with CO2 at 5000 ppm (the measured exposure level was ca. 4900 ppm). Ten healthy college-age students were exposed twice to each of the two conditions for 2.5 h in a design balanced for order of presentation. The raised CO2 concentration had no effect on perceived air quality or physiological responses except for end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), which increased more (to 5.3 kPa) than it was in the reference condition (5.1 kPa). Other results indicate additionally that a 2.5-h exposure to CO2 up to 5000 ppm did not increase intensity of health symptoms reported by healthy young individuals and their performance of simple or moderately difficult cognitive tests and some tasks resembling office work. These results accord well with the current occupational exposure limit recommendation for CO2 and with many other reports published in the literature.

AB  - The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines Conditional Automated Driving (CAD) or SAE level 3 as the next step in the transition to higher automated driving. A human factors challenge at this level is to keep the fallback-ready user aware of the driving situation. The problem with the widely accepted terminology of SAE is that it does not consider the human factors of achieving this safety-critical transition and lacks in defining a required or appropriate state of fallback readiness and how a human reaches this state. This paper aims to understand how research and industry currently perceive the problem and how they counteract it. We conducted exploratory expert interviews with N = 15 subject matter experts from universities, research centres and vehicle manufacturers. Based on the findings of the expert interviews, we discuss how fallback-ready users might be kept in the loop. The results show that the user should remain physically and sensory in the state of regular drivers to allow a safe transition, which narrows down the problem to maintaining an appropriate cognitive state, level of arousal, and motivational conditions. Lastly, the experts identify that the NDRA should be (a) limited to the onboard-entertainment system and (b) context-aware and (temporarily) restricted or interrupted. We provide concrete design recommendations grounded in (or drawing upon) theoretical frameworks and current human factors expert views and highlight specific challenges that require more research.

AB  - With the increasing complexity of modern buildings, it is becoming more challenging for the professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to effectively digest complex engineering and design information and develop an accurate spatial memory that is critical to their daily tasks. As emerging visualization technologies, such as Virtual Reality, are considered as a promising solution, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanism by which different information visualization methods affect AEC task performance. Cognition literature has discovered a strong relationship between attention and memory development, but little has been done to understand how the visual attention patterns during the design documents review affect the effectiveness of spatial memory in AEC tasks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 63) to test how spatial knowledge is acquired in a building inspection task and how the different visual attention patterns affect the development of spatial memory. Participants were asked to review the design information of a real building on campus. To trigger different attention patterns, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups based on the forms of information given in the review session, including 2D, 3D, and VR groups. After a brief review session, participants were asked to go to the real building to identify discrepancies (based on memory) that were intentionally inserted by the authors. The inspection performance was used to evaluate the spatial memory development. The results indicate that in general there is a positive relationship between test subjects’ visual attention (fixation time) and spatial memory, but the increasing rate varies across the three groups, suggesting that visual context plays a critical role in the development efficiency of spatial memory. The findings also indicate that the visual attention – spatial memory relationship may be mediated by the use of different spatial knowledge acquisition strategies. This study is expected to contribute to the construction information technology literature by setting the cornerstone of a cognition-driven information system that tailors into the spatial cognitive process of AEC professionals.

AB  - The presence of robots in everyday life is increasing day by day at a growing pace. Industrial and working environments, health-care assistance in public or domestic areas can benefit from robots' services to accomplish manifold tasks that are difficult and annoying for humans. In such scenarios, Natural Language interactions, enabling collaboration and robot control, are meant to be situated, in the sense that both the user and the robot access and make reference to the environment. Contextual knowledge may thus play a key role in solving inherent ambiguities of grounded language as, for example, the prepositional phrase attachment. In this work, we present a linguistic pipeline for semantic processing of robotic commands, that combines discriminative structured learning, distributional semantics and contextual evidence extracted from the working environment. The final goal is to make the interpretation process of linguistic exchanges depending on physical, cognitive and language-dependent aspects. We present, formalize and discuss an adaptive Spoken Language Understanding chain for robotic commands, that explicitly depends on the operational context during both the learning and processing stages. The resulting framework allows to model heterogeneous information concerning the environment (e.g., positional information about the objects and their properties) and to inject it in the learning process. Empirical results demonstrate a significant contribution of such additional dimensions, achieving up to a 25% of relative error reduction with respect to a pipeline that only exploits linguistic evidence.

AB  - Our working world is on the threshold of a new era: The digital transformation of entire economic sectors and occupational profiles as well as the introduction of new forms of human-machine collaboration through the increased use of big data and cognitive systems require completely new approaches. The key to success in coping with this change, which can be seen in all industries, is to break up old structures and venture something new. The ability to adapt and innovate is becoming a central success-critical factor in entrepreneurial activity. In order to continue to achieve market success and ensure sustainable growth in an extremely dynamic and disruptive environment, enterprises and organisations are called upon to proactively shape change. In addition to the establishment of flexible working models and agile processes, the increased generation and integration of knowledge into and around technical systems in the course of targeted competence development of employees is indispensable. The introduction and use of technical systems thus must go hand in hand with the flexibilisation of innovation and collaboration processes as well as the development of employee skills in order to generate the currently missing socio-technological link – for companies´ added value and for the benefit of people. In this paper, the authors present an overview of currently used creativity techniques and innovation methods and work out the promising potentials as well as basic restrictions of the respective tools. Furthermore, the resulting need for action for the optimisation and enhancement of innovation processes in the interaction of established techniques and possibilities of cognitive systems is presented.

AB  - Laser welding is a widely used but complex industrial process. In this work, we propose the use of an integrated machine intelligence architecture to help address the significant control difficulties that prevent laser welding from seeing its full potential in process engineering and production. This architecture combines three contemporary machine learning techniques to allow a laser welding controller to learn and improve in a self-directed manner. As a first contribution of this work, we show how a deep, auto-encoding neural network is capable of extracting salient, low-dimensional features from real high-dimensional laser welding data. As a second contribution and novel integration step, these features are then used as input to a temporal-difference learning algorithm (in this case a general-value-function learner) to acquire important real-time information about the process of laser welding; temporally extended predictions are used in combination with deep learning to directly map sensor data to the final quality of a welding seam. As a third contribution and final part of our proposed architecture, we suggest that deep learning features and general-value-function predictions can be beneficially combined with actor–critic reinforcement learning to learn context-appropriate control policies to govern welding power in real time. Preliminary control results are demonstrated using multiple runs with a laser-welding simulator. The proposed intelligent laser-welding architecture combines representation, prediction, and control learning: three of the main hallmarks of an intelligent system. As such, we suggest that an integration approach like the one described in this work has the capacity to improve laser welding performance without ongoing and time-intensive human assistance. Our architecture therefore promises to address several key requirements of modern industry. To our knowledge, this architecture is the first demonstrated combination of deep learning and general value functions. It also represents the first use of deep learning for laser welding specifically and production engineering in general. We believe that it would be straightforward to adapt our architecture for use in other industrial and production engineering settings.

AB  - Technology is evolving in the direction of making the users a key part in the model, developing services that adapt to their preferences and needs in a seamless way. So, information and knowledge about people has become one of the main actives for the IT industry. However, only a few major companies are presently able to take advantage of the digital footprint everyone leaves while performing their daily activities. Moreover, people cannot even decide when, how, and by whom the contents and information they are producing are used. In this work, we present the Digital Avatars framework for mobile-based collaborative social computing applications as a realization of People as a Service, a mobile computing model that empowers smartphones with the capability of learning virtual profiles or digital avatars of their owners and sharing them as a service in a controlled and seamless way. Digital Avatars offers services for third party applications, including an inference engine and a module for run-time scripts execution for interacting with the digital avatar in the smartphone assuring the privacy and full control of the users over their data. In this paper, we describe the architecture of this framework and the structure of the digital avatars focusing on an independent living scenario for Mild Cognitive Impairment patients.

To this end, we propose an original conceptual framework based on the idea of a sustainable growth driven by the interplay between AI and HRM. Current academic debate is overly concerned by the impact that future AI will have on business and society. One of the central aspects of the conversation is whether or not AI will replace humans in value-added activities. The study remarks that humanoids are an amplificator of human potential, in light of a human-centered approach. In this vein, present work reconceptualizes the tenets of society 5.0 by considering the category of “innovation ventura”, the evolution of the innovative enterprise in the next AI landscape.

AB  - James Watt invented the steam engine in the 17th century. It outperformed human muscle power by orders of magnitude. Nobody imagined that this single invention would evocate massive consequences: The steam engine increased industrial production, led to societal upheaval, and changed the political landscape for the next 100 years. There had been no historical parallel on the effect of a dedicated technical invention on humankind in such a short timeframe. At the beginning of the 21st century, we might experience a similar dynamic. This time, artificial intelligence spread the word of a new era that makes cognitive capabilities available on a large scale. Machines with highly sophisticated mental competencies will turn upside down the knowledge work in every company department, be it marketing, human resources, research and development, customer service, or the even the board of directors. Moreover, this time, intelligent machines will outperform human brain power. This paper argues that the arrival of artificial intelligence at the enterprise pave the way to a wicked problem: It cannot be resolved by tested methodologies, given procedures, and best practices. Instead, it requires a more sophisticated approach: First, companies must involve all relevant stakeholders at the initial stage of deployment because the impact of artificial intelligence is far-reaching. Second, companies must question their given value system because it closely resonates with the capabilities of artificial intelligence machines. Third, companies must conduct controlled experiments, because “divide and rule” do not work anymore to handle machines that mimic human thinking.

AB  - In dynamic working environments such as factory production lines, the process of decisionmaking combines different types of data and knowledge available in different forms. In many cases, elements impacting decisions are not totally mastered by the decision support system since the activity of the user is highly influenced by the dynamic change of the production system. Thus, in order to set the appropriate context elements surrounding different working situations of factory actors, this paper proposes a context model aiming to represents user's activity and the circumstances under the decisionmaking process. The literature of related works highlighted the advantages of context-awareness in supporting the dynamic adaptation of information according to user's context. The proposed model in this paper takes advantage from the context notion and the fundaments of the activity theory proposed in cognitive science. The intended model is used in an intelligent assistant system dedicated to assist factory workers in the manufacturing process. The main purpose of the context model is to help the assistant system in handling the process of knowledge adaptation and therefore, avoiding the problems of overload and misinterpretation of the information.

AB  - The effectiveness of providing venturi effect and backvent in full face ventilated motorcycle helmets to provide thermal comfort to a rider is investigated using Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of air flow and human thermoregulation system in the microclimate of the helmet. Thermal comfort of a motorcycle rider is then predicted using heat indices. The effect of increase in ambient air temperature on the thermal comfort of a rider wearing a modified ventilated helmet, with venturi effect and backvent on the air flow, and temperature distribution in the region above the head is studied. The results are then compared with the conditions when the rider is wearing a full-face, conventional non-ventilated helmet, ventilated helmet with three vents in front and a helmet with only venturi effect. Results are also compared for the conditions when the rider is not wearing any helmet. It is observed that the venturi effect in a ventilated helmet increases the local air velocities in the air gap as compared to a ventilated helmet with three vents in the front of the helmets. Further, it is observed that backvent in venturi helmet augments the thermal comfort of the rider if the ambient air temperature is less than normal body temperature. When air temperatures are higher than the body temperature (36 °C), it is found that the trends are reversed and ventilated helmets are no longer able to provide thermal comfort to the motorcycle rider. For better understanding of effect of newly designed ventilated helmets on the cognitive performance and the willingness of a rider to wear helmets, subjective evaluation of the prototype of venturi helmet is done. Each set of trials required riders to ride with different types of helmets. Based on the results of numerical simulations of ventilation in helmets and responses from subjective human trials, a set of fluid dynamics and design guidelines is also proposed for the helmet manufacturing industries.

AB  - Both humans and robots have crucial advantages regarding industrial assembly processes. While robots ace at repetitive and monotonous assembly steps, humans are able to adapt flexibly to new situations and upcoming problems. Combining these advantages by means of direct human-robot cooperation seems to be interesting for producing companies but has not been realized yet. While the corresponding technologies are already available, appropriate safety standards to ensure occupational safety are missing and represent one of the main barriers for introducing direct human-robot cooperation. This paper describes the requirements for a workplace, where humans and robots jointly perform an assembly process without separation between their workspaces. The requirements are identified in line with an ergonomic workplace for different aged working persons, whereas the robot assists the human with the assembly process. The analysis considers technical, human-related, and normative requirements. Afterwards, an early implementation of the concept is presented based on a cognitively automated assembly system using a lightweight robot.

AB  - Human operators in the upcoming Industry 4.0 workplace will face accelerating job demands such as elevated cognitive complexity. Unobtrusive objective measures of mental workload (MWL) are therefore in high demand as indicated by both theory and practice. This pilot study explored the wearability and external validity of pupillometry, a MWL measure robustly validated in laboratory settings and now deployable in work settings demanding operator mobility. In an ecologically valid work environment, 21 participants performed two manual assemblies - one of low and one of high complexity - while wearing eye-tracking glasses for pupil size measurement. Results revealed that the device was perceived as fairly wearable in terms of physical and mental comfort. In terms of validity, no significant differences in mean pupil size were found between the assemblies even though subjective mental workload differed significantly. Exploratory analyses on the pupil size when attending to the assembly instructions only, were inconclusive. The present work suggests that current lab-based procedures might not be adequate yet for in-the-field mobile pupillometry. From a broader perspective, these findings also invite a more nuanced view on the current validity of lab-validated physiological MWL-measures when applied in real-life settings. We therefore conclude with some key insights for future development of mobile pupillometry.

AB  - Previous research has highlighted the importance of individual factors predicting human beings’ relatively poor performance in controlling dynamic operational systems. Taking an industrial and organizational (IO) psychology perspective within a behavioral operations research context, this study focuses on erroneous stock-flow thinking and general cognitive ability. It uses data from laboratory experiments to test a mediating structural equation model firmly grounded in IO psychology theory, proposing both a direct concave impact of general cognitive ability on control task performance and an indirect concave effect mediated by stock-flow thinking. With our results we are the first to demonstrate that stock-flow thinking serves as a mediator of general cognitive ability on performance, while at the same time, general cognitive ability non-linearly impacts performance. These findings contribute to theory building in behavioral operational research and demonstrate how adoption of perspectives other than the traditional paradigms used can help. It also has practical implications as it improves the relative assessment of different levers to increase operational control performance. We find that the total impact of general cognitive ability on control performance is higher than the direct effect of stock-flow thinking. Therefore, companies should add stock-flow thinking tests to their personnel selection toolbox, but put more weight on selecting operational managers with high cognitive abilities and somewhat less weight on training efforts that aim to reduce stock-flow failures.

AB  - In the modern world we are continuously surrounded by information. The human brain has to analyse and interpret this information to transform into useable knowledge that is then used in decision making activities. The advent and implementation of Industry 4.0 will make it a requirement for systems within factories to interact and share large quantities of information with each other. This large volume of information will make it even more difficult for the human resources within the factory to sift through the large amount of information required since there is a limit to the information that our brains can cope with. Just in time information retrieval (JITIR) within the digital factory environment aims to provide support to the human stakeholders in the system by proactively yet non-intrusively providing the required information at the right time based on the users context. This paper will therefore provide an insight into the cognitive difficulties experienced by humans in the digital factory and how JITIR can tackle these challenges. By validating the JITIR concept, several industry scenarios have been evaluated: an exemplary model, concerning the machine tool industry, is presented in the paper. The results of this research are a set of guidelines for the development of a digital factory support tool.

AB  - The trends of robotics changes as service robots gain more ground and become part of our daily lives. Service or social robots have to function in less controlled and more dynamically changing environments than industrial robots, and the users of social robots are generally less technologically literate than the users of industrial robots, therefore social robots have to be able to interact naturally with humans and to fit in the human social environment. Social robotics faces new challenges that require an interdisciplinary approach. In contrast to previous approaches where the communication and behaviour of social robots were based on human-human interactions, ethorobotics offer a new direction. Today robotics is not advanced enough to reach the physical and cognitive capabilities of humans thus human-animal interaction can serve as a better model for designing the behaviour of social robots. Human-dog relationship is a good example for this paradigm as dogs have similar roles as social robots will have in the future. Dogs acquired social cognitive skills during domestication that enhances the interspecific relationship with humans and helps their interactions. Etho-robotics research uses ethological principles and methods to derive complex behavioural models which can be transcribed to mathematical form and implemented into robots. Human-robot interaction studies can be conducted to evaluate and refine the implemented models. Etho-robotics research was already used to create behavioural models for attachment and for multiple aspects of human-robot interactions. The application of Fuzzy Rule Interpolation methods fits well the conceptually “spare rule-based” structure of the existing descriptive verbal ethological models, as in case of the descriptive verbal ethological models the “completeness” of the rule-base is not required. The main benefit of the FRI method adaptation in ethological model implementation is the fact, that it has a simple rule-based knowledge representation format. Because of this, even after numerical optimization of the model, the rules are still “human readable”, and helps the formal validation of the model by the ethological experts. On the other side due to the FRI base, the model has still low computational demand and fits directly the requirements of the embedded implementations.

AB  - Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an active research field of digital signal processing and plays a crucial role in numerous applications of Human–computer interaction (HCI). Nowadays, the baseline state of the art systems has quite a low accuracy and high computations, which needs upgrading to make it reasonable for real-time industrial uses such as detection of content from speech data. The main intent for low recognition rate and high computational cost is a scarceness of datasets, model configuration, and patterns recognition that is the supreme stimulating work for building a robust SER system. In this study, we address these problems and propose a simple and lightweight deep learning-based self-attention module (SAM) for SER system. The transitional features map is given to SAM, which produces efficiently the channel and spatial axes attention map with insignificant overheads. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in channel attention to extracting global cues and a special dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) in spatial attention to extract spatial info from input tensor. Moreover, we merge, spatial and channel attention maps to produce a combine attention weights as a self-attention module. We placed SAM in the middle of convolutional and connected layers and trained it in an end-to-end mode. The ablation study and comprehensive experimentations are accompanied over IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, and EMO-DB speech emotion datasets. The proposed SER system shows consistent improvements in overall experiments for all datasets and shows 78.01%, 80.00%, and 93.00% average recall, respectively.

AB  - Responsiveness in manufacturing is a key challenge for facing open-ended changes more and more enhanced by the increasing development of easy-to-use digital technologies. However, the control of a given situation into wholeness by a respondent system is raising design issues to make cooperating together the many entities of the Human, digital and physical parts interleaved in a related world-of-interest in order to reach and maintain common goals. This paper provides an overview of some relevant works for attaining a situated perspective of the responsiveness of a system to be engineered with simplexity. This property of living beings is more particularly explored for the cognitive orchestration of the interdisciplinary knowledge assets, which are cooperatively involved in a project system in order to frame a given situation examined with a system perspective.

AB  - Over the last few years there has been rapid research growth into eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and the closely aligned Interpretable Machine Learning (IML). Drivers for this growth include recent legislative changes and increased investments by industry and governments, along with increased concern from the general public. People are affected by autonomous decisions every day and the public need to understand the decision-making process to accept the outcomes. However, the vast majority of the applications of XAI/IML are focused on providing low-level ‘narrow’ explanations of how an individual decision was reached based on a particular datum. While important, these explanations rarely provide insights into an agent's: beliefs and motivations; hypotheses of other (human, animal or AI) agents' intentions; interpretation of external cultural expectations; or, processes used to generate its own explanation. Yet all of these factors, we propose, are essential to providing the explanatory depth that people require to accept and trust the AI's decision-making. This paper aims to define levels of explanation and describe how they can be integrated to create a human-aligned conversational explanation system. In so doing, this paper will survey current approaches and discuss the integration of different technologies to achieve these levels with Broad eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (Broad-XAI), and thereby move towards high-level ‘strong’ explanations.

AB  - The next generation of robotic agents, to employed both in industrial and service robotic applications, will be characterized by a high degree of Human–Robot Partnership that implies, for example, sharing common objectives, bidirectional flow of information, capability to learn from each other, and availability to mutual training. Moreover, there is a widespread feeling in the research community that probably Humans will not accept Robots as trustable Partners if they cannot ascribe some form of awareness and true understanding to them. This means that, in addition to the incremental improvements of Robotic-Bodyware, there will be the need for a substantial jump of the Robotic-Cogniware, namely a new class of Cognitive Architectures for Robots (CARs) that match the requirements and specific constraints of Human–Robot Partnership. The working hypothesis that underlies this paper is that such class of CARs must be bio-inspired, not in the sense of fine-grain imitation of neurobiology but the large framework of embodied cognition. In our opinion, trajectory/gesture formation should be one of the building blocks of bio-inspired CARs because biological motion is a fundamental channel of inter-human partnership, a true body language that allows mutual understanding of intentions. Moreover, one of the main concepts of embodied cognition, related to the importance of motor imagery, is that real (or overt) actions and mental (or covert) actions are generated by the same internal model and support the cognitive capabilities of human skilled subjects. The paper reviews the field of human trajectory formation, revealing in a novel manner the fil rouge that runs through motor neuroscience and proposes a computational framework for a robotic formulation that also addresses the Degrees of Freedom Problem and is formulated in terms of the force-field-based Passive Motion Paradigm.

AB  - The evolution of mechatronics indicates that Technical Cybernetics (TC) was its progenitor, the parent science of informatics that at the present stage of human development has ensured the transition from an industrial to an information society, information (IT) and cognitive technologies (CT). However, we should recognize that the IT and CT, as catalysts for development and progress, represent only a shell, which acquires the substantive content when solving specific practical problems. In engineering practice, the MS act as such filling, defining the image of the technosphere of the 21st century [1]. A similar example is Common Dateware (CDW) [2] that translates the kinetic energy of an operating mechanism (OM) movement in mechatronics through the Resolvers-to-Digital Converters (RDC) [3], in which the output orthogonal signal resolvers are converted into an analog or digital equivalent of movement, realizing the connection between space and time [4].

AB  - Facial expressions play a crucial role in emotion recognition as compared to other modalities. In this work, an integrated network, which is capable of recognizing emotion intensity levels from facial images in real time using deep learning technique is proposed. The cognitive study of facial expressions based on expression intensity levels are useful in applications such as healthcare, coboting, Industry 4.0 etc. This work proposes to augment emotion recognition with 2 other important parameters, valence and emotion intensity. This helps in better automated responses by a machine to an emotion. The valence model helps in classifying emotion as positive and negative emotions and discrete model classifies emotions as happy, anger, disgust, surprise and neutral state using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Feature extraction and classification are carried out using CMU Multi-PIE database. The proposed architecture achieves 99.1% and 99.11% accuracy for valence model and discrete model respectively for offline image data with 5-fold cross validation. The average accuracy achieved in real time for valance model and discrete model is 95% & 95.6% respectively. Also, this work contributes to build a new database using facial landmarks, with three intensity levels of facial expressions which helps to classify expressions into low, mild and high intensities. The performance is also tested for different classifiers. The proposed integrated system is configured for real time Human Robot Interaction (HRI) applications on a test bed consisting of Raspberry Pi and RPA platform to assess its performance.
