It enables associations to improve major business measurements, for example, productivity, product reliability, quality, and safety, while decreasing downtime and lowering costs. Considering all the facts that can prejudice the manufacturing performance in Industry 4.0, the cognitive load has received more attention, since it was previously neglected with respect to manufacturing industries. This paper aims to investigate what causes cognitive load reduction in manufacturing environments, i.e., human-computer interaction technologies that reduce the identified causes and the applications of cognitive manufacturing that use the referred technologies.

Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing the operator's physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator's performance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for online assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate the workers' attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers' mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics in manufacturing.","[Lagomarsino, Marta; Lorenzini, Marta; Ajoudani, Arash] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Human Robot Interfaces & Phys Interact Lab, Via SQuir 19d, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Lagomarsino, Marta; De Momi, Elena] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Via GColombo 40, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Lagomarsino, M (corresponding author), Ist Italiano Tecnol, Human Robot Interfaces & Phys Interact Lab, Via SQuir 19d, I-16163 Genoa, Italy.;Lagomarsino, M (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Via GColombo 40, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",marta.lagomarsino@iit.it,"Lagomarsino, Marta/GLU-8977-2022; DE MOMI, ELENA/D-7375-2016","DE MOMI, ELENA/0000-0002-8819-2734; Lagomarsino, Marta/0000-0001-9121-1812",ERC-StG Ergo-Lean [850932]; European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme SOPHIA [871237],ERC-StG Ergo-Lean(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme SOPHIA,"Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by the ERC-StG Ergo-Lean (Grant Agreement No. 850932) , in part by the European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme SOPHIA (Grant Agreement No. 871237) .",,51,23,23,4,61,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

Despite the design of a command channel from human operators to robots, most existing studies on teleoperation fail to focus on the design of the feedback channel from the robot to the human operator, which plays a crucial role in reducing the cognitive load, particularly in precise and concentrated manufacturing tasks. This paper focuses on designing a feedback channel for the cognitive interface between a human operator and a robot considering human cognition. Current studies on human-robot cognitive interfaces in robot teleoperation are extensively surveyed. Further, the modalities of human cognition that foster understanding and transparency during teleoperation are identified. In addition, the human-robot cognitive interface, which utilizes the proposed multi-modal feedback channel, is developed on a teleoperated robotic grasping system as a case study. Finally, a series of experiments based on different modal feedback channels are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing the performance of the teleoperated grasping of fragile products and reducing the cognitive load via the objective aspects of experimental results and the subjective aspects of operator feedback.","[Zheng, Chen; Wang, Kangning; Gao, Shiqi; Yu, Yang; Wang, Zhanxi] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 127 West Youyi Rd, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Chen] CSSC Huangpu Wenchong Shipbuilding Co Ltd, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Adv Welding Technol Ships, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yunlong] Monash Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Melbourne 3168, Australia; [Tang, Yunlong] Monash Univ, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Melbourne, 3168, Australia",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Monash University; Monash University,"Tang, YL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Melbourne 3168, Australia.;Tang, YL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Melbourne, 3168, Australia.",yunlong.tang1@monash.edu,,,Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022M712933]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51805437]; [2023-JC-YB-299],Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));,"This work was supported by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Grant No. 2023-JC-YB-299), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2022M712933) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51805437).",,54,0,0,13,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0956-5515,1572-8145,,J INTELL MANUF,J.

Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupa-tional ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye -tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks.","[Biondi, Francesco N.; Saberi, Babak; Pillai, Prarthana; Balasingam, Balakumar] Univ Windsor, Human Syst Lab, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Graf, Frida] Atlas Copco AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [Cort, Joel] Univ Windsor, Dept Kinesiol, Occupat Simulat & Ergon Lab, Windsor, ON, Canada",University of Windsor; Atlas Copco; University of Windsor,"Biondi, FN (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Human Syst Lab, Windsor, ON, Canada.",francesco.biondi@uwindsor.ca,"biondi, francesco/B-4512-2013; Pillai, Prarthana/GPK-6250-2022","Biondi, Francesco N./0000-0002-5558-4707",Atlas Copco Inc.; Mitacs; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Atlas Copco Inc.; Mitacs; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"s This research was made possible by the financial contribution of Atlas Copco Inc. and Mitacs, and was in part supported by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",,57,26,27,13,69,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

The eye -movement experiments were conducted to research the effects of visual representations of industrial icons on search performance. The results show that the visual search performance is optimal for negative polarity icons with the line width of 1.0px and the figure/background area ratio of 50%.

Current online and offline robot programming methods are difficult to use and require extensive experience or skills. On the other hand, the manufacturing industries are experiencing a labor shortage. An essential question, therefore, is: how would a new robot programming method help novice users complete complex tasks effectively, efficiently, and intuitively? To answer this question, we proposed HAR(2)bot, a novel human-centered augmented reality programming interface with awareness of cognitive load. Using NASA's system design theory and the cognitive load theory, a set of guidelines for designing an AR-based human-robot interaction system is obtained through a human-centered design process. Based on these guidelines, we designed and implemented a human-in-the-loop workflow with features for cognitive load management. The effectiveness and efficiency of HAR(2)bot are verified in two complex tasks compared with existing online programming methods. We also evaluated HAR(2)bot quantitatively and qualitatively through a user study with 16 participants. According to the user study, compared with existing methods, HAR(2)bot has higher efficiency, a lower overall cognitive load, lower cognitive loads for each type, and higher safety.","[Yang, Wenhao; Zhang, Yunbo] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Xiao, Qinqin] Univ Rochester, Warner Sch Educ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Zhang, Yunbo] Rochester Inst Technol, Sch Informat iSchool, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology; University of Rochester; Rochester Institute of Technology,"Zhang, YB (corresponding author), Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.;Zhang, YB (corresponding author), Rochester Inst Technol, Sch Informat iSchool, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",ywzeie@rit.edu,"Yang, Wenhao/IVH-2691-2023","Yang, Wenhao/0009-0004-4977-2914; Xiao, Qinqin/0000-0003-3115-3811",Bootcamp fund of RIT; National Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1922591],Bootcamp fund of RIT; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work has been partially supported by the startup fund and the Bootcamp fund of RIT.

Understanding the factors influencing assembly errors is critical for quality improvement. The sequence of assembly operations, a factor markedly affecting cognitive load, remains largely understudied. We aimed to assess the effect of changing the sequence of assembly operations on error rates through four field experiments conducted in a car manufacturing plant. The parts (and errors) under study were child lock labels (missing labels), sunroofs (missing bolts), windshield wiper arms (loose bolts), and armrests (wrong selection). Parts were chosen based on data from quality records, and they represent different scenarios regarding the sequencing of assembly operations. Minitab was used to conduct the statistical test for two proportions at a significance level of 0.05. The experiments ran for a period varying from 9 to 25 weeks (22292 to 138456 cars). All four experiments exhibited significant differences in the proportion of errors. MODAPTS cycle-time calculations revealed no negative effect of assembly sequence variations on productivity. The study findings show that changing the assembly operation sequence can reduce the error rates, possibly due to the intermediary effect in reducing the operator's cognitive load. Overall, realizing quality improvement requires optimizing the assembly operation sequence in terms of time and productivity while considering its possible impact on error rates.","[Real, Carlos] Sandalwood Engn & Ergon, Livonia, MI 48152 USA; [Torres, Yaniel] Univ Antioquia, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Medellin 050010, Colombia",Universidad de Antioquia,"Real, C (corresponding author), Sandalwood Engn & Ergon, Livonia, MI 48152 USA.",creal@sandalwood.com,"Real, Carlos/KCL-5170-2024",,,,,,74,1,1,3,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,34644,34655,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3371980,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3371980,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KO6Z9,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001180961100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human -inthe -loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human -centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance -based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent ������-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load.","[Pillai, Prarthana; Balasingam, Balakumar] Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9G 3P4, Canada; [Jaekel, Arunita] Univ Windsor, Sch Comp Sci, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Biondi, Francesco N.] Univ Windsor, Fac Human Kinet, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9G 3P4, Canada",University of Windsor; University of Windsor; University of Windsor,"Pillai, P (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9G 3P4, Canada.",pillaip@uwindsor.ca; singam@uwindsor.ca; arunita@uwindsor.ca; fbiondi@uwindsor.ca,"Jaekel, Arunita/KIC-8512-2024; Pillai, Prarthana/GPK-6250-2022; biondi, francesco/B-4512-2013","Pillai, Prarthana/0000-0001-8875-3784; Biondi, Francesco N./0000-0002-5558-4707",,,,,47,1,1,20,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

Despite technological advances in automation, the presence of human operators remains essential on future shop floors. Consequently, it is of interest for manufacturing organizations how cyber-physical operator assistance systems (C.O.A.S.) can augment skills of operators on the shop floor. However, there is a limited understanding of how relevant stakeholders in manufacturing organizations assess the suitability of COAS. This is crucial in so far as the adoption of COAS significantly depends on the approval of stakeholders throughout the respective manufacturing organization. This paper explores how stakeholders in manufacturing organizations assess the role of COAS on future shop floors. This is realized by conducting an exploratory, multi-method, qualitative study encompassing interviews of executives, instructors, and operators. Additionally, the study incorporates ethnographic observations in industrial education. A result of the study is that informants expect COAS to be promising for manufacturing organizations if systems augment cognitive abilities of operators, rather than their physical abilities.","[Moencks, M.; Roth, E.; Bohne, T.] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Dept Engn, Cyber Human Lab, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Moencks, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, Dept Engn, Cyber Human Lab, Cambridge, England.",mm2393@cam.ac.uk,,"Moncks, Mirco/0000-0003-1108-6455",,,,,15,4,4,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2157-3611,,978-1-5386-7220-4,IN C IND ENG ENG MAN,,,2020,,,,,,,419,423,,10.1109/ieem45057.2020.9309734,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ieem45057.2020.9309734,,,5,"Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BT3PE,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000821932400080,View Full Record in Web of Science

This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program -synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the pro-gramming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in par-allel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software.","[Niermann, Dario; Petzoldt, Christoph; Freitag, Michael] Univ Bremen, BIBA Bremer Inst Prod & Logist GmbH, Hochschulring 20, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Doernbach, Tobias; Isken, Melvin] Cellumation GmbH, Kleiner Ort 7, D-28357 Bremen, Germany; [Freitag, Michael] Univ Bremen, Fac Prod Engn, Badgasteiner Str, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",BIBA - Bremer Institut fur Produktion & Logistik; University of Bremen; University of Bremen,"Niermann, D (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, BIBA Bremer Inst Prod & Logist GmbH, Hochschulring 20, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",nie@biba.uni-bremen.de,,"Niermann, Dario/0000-0002-2098-0945; Doernbach, Tobias/0000-0001-6488-8211; Petzoldt, Christoph/0000-0003-2873-4404",European Regional Development Fund (EFRE); Bremer Aufbau-Bank (BAB) [FuE0637B],European Regional Development Fund (EFRE)(European Union (EU)); Bremer Aufbau-Bank (BAB),"This work is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (EFRE) and the Bremer Aufbau-Bank (BAB) as part of the project KoMILo - Context-dependent, Al-based interface for multimodal human-machine interaction with technical logistics systems (funding code: FuE0637B).

Where total automation is ineffective, operator assistance systems (OAS) could increase productivity and empower the workforce. Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) are systems that interact with operators to modify their cognitive or physical capabilities whilst performing industrial tasks. Given the important role of humans in future manufacturing environments that cannot be automated, production organizations in industry and Human-Technology Integration (HTI) researchers need to understand where OAS can be deployed and what human factors and other human implications arise from their deployment. In short, capturing views from stakeholders who are both affected by and affect the successful implementation of new technologies are essential to align technological innovations with a human-centric perspective. However, based on our literature review of OAS, we find that there are few technology-neutral enquiries on the industrial applicability of OAS. In particular, we note a lack of considerations of the different requirements for OAS resulting from diverse stakeholders in industry, which is expected to be of importance when designing effective HTI. To address this gap, we explore the industrial context of OAS and the perspectives of stakeholder groups across organizations on the applicability of OAS using a multi-method research approach encompassing 27 qualitative expert interviews and ethnographic observations of three industrial contexts. A key finding of our contextual enquiry is that participants expect OAS to be beneficial on shop floors if designed to improve cognitive abilities, such as inductive reasoning. Further, in the case a company seeks to introduce an OAS to augment physical capabilities of operators whilst attached to their bodies, the data indicate a cautious approach is sensible as many operators reject such a form of augmentation. We highlight what our findings mean for HTI research, especially as it relates to consideration of the highly contextual user requirements when developing and integrating human-technology systems for industry.","[Moencks, Mirco; Roth, Elisa] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, 17 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England; [Bohne, Thomas] Univ Cambridge, Cyber Human Lab, 17 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England; [Kristensson, Per Ola] Univ Cambridge, Intelligent Interact Syst Grp, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Moencks, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, 17 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England.",mm2393@cam.ac.uk,,"Moncks, Mirco/0000-0003-1108-6455",,,,,90,3,3,4,68,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

In a user study (n = 40), we explore how autonomous swarm intelligence algorithms and novel tangible interaction modalities relate to subjective and physiological indices of operator cognitive load (i.e., NASA Task Load Index, heart rate variability). Our findings suggest that there are differences in workload across conditions; however, subjective and cardiac measures appear to be sensitive to different aspects of cognitive state. The results hint at the potential of both tangible interfaces and automation to engage operators and reduce cognitive load, yet show the need for further validation of workload measures for use in studying and optimizing human-swarm interactions.","[Paas, Anita; Coffey, Emily B.

Additionally, a comparative user study (N=24) was conducted with conventional worker assistance methods to evaluate a prototypical implementation of the concept. The results illustrate the enhancing opportunity of the novel approach to save cognitive abilities and to induce performance improvements.

Virtual Reality (VR) is considered an efficient solution for training, since it provides immersive, realistic, and interactive simulations environments promoting a learn-by-doing approach, far from the risks of the real field. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by several studies, but a proper assessment of the operator's cognitive response in terms of stress and cognitive load during the use of such technology is still lacking. This paper proposes an integrated methodology for the analysis of user's cognitive states, suitable for each kind of training in the industrial sector and beyond, fostering the human-centred design and manufacturing perspective. The methodology has been assessed using an industrial case study where virtual training is used for assembly of agricultural vehicles. Experimental results highlighted that, with VR additional supportive information, while operators' errors drastically decrease, the stress increases for complex tasks, due to the greater amount of information to manage. The proposed protocol allows understanding the operators' cognitive conditions in order to optimize the VR training application, avoiding operators' stress, mental overload, and improving performance.","[Brunzini, Agnese] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Brunzini, Agnese; Grandi, Fabio; Peruzzini, Margherita] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Engn Enzo Ferrari, Modena, Italy; [Pellicciari, Marcello] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Sci & Methods Engn, Reggio Emilia, Italy; [Brunzini, Agnese] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Via Brecce Bianche 12, I-60131 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Marche Polytechnic University,"Brunzini, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Via Brecce Bianche 12, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",a.brunzini@staff.univpm.it,"Pellicciari, Marcello/AAE-9293-2020; Grandi, Fabio/ISU-8784-2023; Pellicciari, Marcello/O-5284-2015; Peruzzini, Margherita/K-8165-2013","Pellicciari, Marcello/0000-0003-2578-4123; Peruzzini, Margherita/0000-0003-2260-0392; Brunzini, Agnese/0000-0003-0450-2510; Grandi, Fabio/0000-0001-5465-0349",,,,,48,1,1,3,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

To implement modern concepts that enable tools and systems for such a cognitive production system, several challenges on the shop floor level must first be resolved. This paper discusses the implementation of selected cognitive technologies on a real industrial case-study of a construction machine manufacturer. The partner company works on the concept of mass customization but utilizes manual labour for the high-variety assembly stations or lines. Sensing and guidance devices are used to provide information to the worker and also retrieve and monitor the working, with respecting data privacy policies. Next, a specified process of data contextualization, visual analytics, and causal discovery is used to extract useful information from the retrieved data via sensors. Communications and safety systems are explained further to complete the loop of implementation of cognitive entities on a manual assembly line. This deepened involvement of cognitive technologies are human-centered, rather than automated systems. The explained cognitive technologies enhance human interaction with the processes and ease the production methods. These concepts form a quintessential vision for an effective assembly line.

Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.","[Gualtieri, Luca; De Marchi, Matteo; Rauch, Erwin] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Ind Engn & Automat IEA, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Fraboni, Federico] Univ Bologna, Dept Psychol, Via Zamboni 33, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Bologna,"Rauch, E (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Ind Engn & Automat IEA, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",luca.gualtieri@unibz.it; erwin.rauch@unibz.it,"Fraboni, Federico/K-8171-2019; Rauch, Erwin/A-2275-2017","Gualtieri, Luca/0000-0002-4976-1893; Rauch, Erwin/0000-0002-2033-4265",,,,,88,23,24,9,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

The HDT has demonstrated potential as a strategic tool for enhancing productivity, safety, and collaboration within the framework of Industry 5.0. In response to this challenge, this paper outlines a process for tracking human cognitive load using the galvanic skin response as a physiological marker and proposes a novel method for managing cognitive load based on the extended Human Asset Administration Shell (HAAS). The proposed HAAS framework integrates real-time data streams from wearable sensors, user skills, contextual information, task specifics, and environmental and surrounding conditions to deliver a comprehensive understanding of an individual's cognitive state, physical wellness, and skill set. Through the incorporation of skills set, physical, physiological, and psychological variables, and task parameters, the developed HAAS framework enables the identification, management, and development of individual capabilities, thereby facilitating individualized training and knowledge exchange. The applicability of the developed framework is proved by an experiments in the Operator 4.0 laboratory with the detailed HAAS parameters.","[Eesee, Abdulrahman K.; Abonyi, Janos; Ruppert, Tamas] Univ Pannonia, Dept Proc Engn, HUN REN PE Complex Syst Monitoring Res Grp, H-8200 Veszprem, Hungary; [Eesee, Abdulrahman K.; Jasko, Szilard] Northern Tech Univ, Dept Med Instrumentat Technol Engn, Mosul 41001, Iraq; [Eigner, Gyorgy] Univ Pannonia, Univ Pannonia Nagykanizsa, Univ Ctr Circular Econ, Dept Appl Informat, H-8200 Veszprem, Hungary; [Eigner, Gyorgy] Obuda Univ, Biomatics & Appl Artificial Intelligence Inst, John Neumann Fac Informat, H-1034 Budapest, Hungary; [Eigner, Gyorgy] Univ Res & Innovat Ctr, Physiol Control Res Ctr, H-1034 Budapest, Hungary",University of Pannonia; Northern Technical University; University of Pannonia; Obuda University,"Ruppert, T (corresponding author), Univ Pannonia, Dept Proc Engn, HUN REN PE Complex Syst Monitoring Res Grp, H-8200 Veszprem, Hungary.",ruppert@abonyilab.com,"Ruppert, Tamás/ABG-8283-2021; Abonyi, Janos/O-2832-2013; Eesee, Abdulrahman K./E-1060-2019","Ruppert, Tamas/0000-0001-9441-843X; Eigner, Gyorgy/0000-0001-8038-2210; Abonyi, Janos/0000-0001-8593-1493; Eesee, Abdulrahman K./0000-0001-9746-700X","Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund through the 2021 Thematic Excellence Programme Funding Scheme","Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund through the 2021 Thematic Excellence Programme Funding Scheme",No Statement Available,,59,3,3,3,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,16559,16572,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3359902,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3359902,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,HI5Z8,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001158893400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, working entire shifts in close contact with a robotic system may introduce new hazards from a cognitive ergonomics perspective. This paper presents a methodological approach to monitor the evolution of the operator's psychophysical state noninvasively in shifts of a repetitive assembly process, focusing on stress, mental workload, and fatigue. Through the use of non-invasive biosensors, it is possible to obtain objective information, even in real time, on the operator's cognitive load and stress in a naturalistic manner (i.e., without interrupting or hindering the process). In the HRC setting, recognition of the operator's psychophysical state is the first step in supporting his or her well-being and can provide clues to improve collaboration. The proposed method was applied to a case study aimed at comparing shifts performed both manually and with a cobot of a repetitive assembly process. The results showed significant differences in terms of process performance evolution and psychophysical state of the operator. In particular, the presence of the cobot resulted in fewer process failures, stress and cognitive load especially in the first phase of the work shift. The case study analyzed also showed the adequacy of noninvasively collected physiological data in providing important information on the evolution of the operator's stress, cognitive load, and fatigue.","[Gervasi, Riccardo; Capponi, Matteo; Mastrogiacomo, Luca; Franceschini, Fiorenzo] Politecn Torino, DIGEP Dept Management & Prod Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Franceschini, F (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, DIGEP Dept Management & Prod Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",riccardo.gervasi@polito.it; matteo.capponi@polito.it; luca.mastrogiacomo@polito.it; fiorenzo.franceschini@polito.it,"Franceschini, Fiorenzo/C-2583-2013; Gervasi, Riccardo/KHE-3109-2024","CAPPONI, MATTEO/0000-0002-4669-2140; Gervasi, Riccardo/0000-0002-3006-3382; Mastrogiacomo, Luca/0000-0002-8454-5918","Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; European Union Next-GenerationEU (PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) - MIS-SIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.3 [D.D. 1551.11-10-2022, PE00000004]","Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; European Union Next-GenerationEU (PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) - MIS-SIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.3(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions)","Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

In addition to measuring physical workload, monitoring operators' cognitive workload is becoming a key element in maintaining a healthy and high-performing working environment in future digitalized manufacturing systems. The current approaches to the measurement of cognitive workload may be inadequate when human operators are faced with a series of new digitalized technologies, where their impact on operators' mental workload and performance needs to be better understood. Therefore, a new method for measuring and determining the cognitive workload is required. Here, we propose a new method for determining cognitive-workload indices in a human-centric environment. The approach provides a method to define and verify the relationships between the factors of task complexity, cognitive workload, operators' level of expertise, and indirectly, the operator performance level in a highly digitalized manufacturing environment. Our strategy is tested in a series of experiments where operators perform assembly tasks on a Wankel Engine block. The physiological signals from heart-rate variability and pupillometry bio-markers of 17 operators were captured and analysed using eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant differences in both cardiac and pupillometry-based cognitive load indices across the four task complexity levels (rest, low, medium, and high). Notably, these developed indices also provide better indications of cognitive load responding to changes in complexity compared to other measures. Additionally, while experts appear to exhibit lower cognitive loads across all complexity levels, further analysis is required to confirm statistically significant differences. In conclusion, the results from both measurement sensors are found to be compatible and in support of the proposed new approach. Our strategy should be useful for designing and optimizing workplace environments based on the cognitive load experienced by operators.","[Ma, Xinyue; Monfared, Radmehr; Grant, Rebecca; Goh, Yee Mey] Loughborough Univ, Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, England",Loughborough University,"Goh, YM (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, England.",r.p.monfared@lboro.ac.uk; y.goh@lboro.ac.uk,"Ma, Xinyue/K-8161-2012; Monfared, Radmehr/E-5245-2010; Goh, Yee Mey/B-3157-2011","Monfared, Radmehr/0000-0002-8782-3426; Grant, Rebecca/0000-0001-9804-9934; Goh, Yee Mey/0000-0002-5028-9506",Loughborough University; Centre for Mathematical Cognition at Loughborough University,Loughborough University; Centre for Mathematical Cognition at Loughborough University,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the equipment and tutorial support from the Centre for Mathematical Cognition at Loughborough University.

The survey consisted of 27 questions and primarily focused on learning objectives within the cognitive and psychomotor domains of Bloom's taxonomy. The survey tool was also designed to determine industry perceptions of virtual training for manual assembly operations and perceptions of its potential benefits and limitations. Specific survey questions address the desired complexity of training objectives within the cognitive and psychomotor domains. The results from this survey will later be used provide a framework for customized, targeted training modules for assembly workers. Job postings for assembly line workers were analyzed using Natural Language Processing techniques. Specifically, postings were analyzed to relate action verbs to the distinct domains of Bloom's taxonomy of learning objectives. In addition, a frequency analysis of the verbs provided insight into skills that are in demand. Preliminary survey results were compared to results from the job ads analysis and trends from O*NET (R) for alignment or discrepancies between announced characteristics and desired skills. This comparison provides insights into training requirements and upskilling opportunities for the manufacturing workforce.

These cobots, designed to work closely with human operators, bring adaptability and efficiency to the manufacturing floor, adjusting to various tasks and production needs. This integration, while promising, introduces challenges, especially in terms of human adaptation and learning in dynamic work settings. To date, research has primarily focused on the technological advancement of cobots, often overlooking the human component in this collaborative equation. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by employing pupillometry to explore learning effects within human-robot collaboration (HRC), specifically examining human adaptation to complex and extended tasks reflective of industrial environments. Through a multifactorial design involving 19 participants engaged in three trials repeated for two task difficulty levels, the research analyzes performance metrics along with changes in pupil diameter. The results discovered that repetitive task execution is related to decreased operation time and pupil diameter, suggesting reduced cognitive load levels. These findings imply the potential utility of pupillometry as an indicator of human adaptation to complex task execution, promoting further investigation into physiological measures to optimize cobot integration into the workplace.","[Zanardi, Davide] Univ Padua, Dept Dev Psychol & Socializat, Padua, Italy; [Nenna, Federica; Orlando, Egle Maria; Nannetti, Margherita; Buodo, Giulia; Gamberini, Luciano] Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, Padua, Italy; [Mingardi, Michele] Univ Padua, Human Inspired Technol Res Ctr, Padua, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua,"Zanardi, D (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Dev Psychol & Socializat, Padua, Italy.",davide.zanardi.1@phd.unipd.it; federica.nenna@unipd.it; eglemaria.orlando@phd.unipd.it; margherita.nannetti@studenti.unipd.it; michele.mingardi@unipd.it; giulia.buodo@unipd.it; luciano.gamberini@unipd.it,"Buodo, Giulia/D-1229-2014; Nenna, Federica/AHA-0172-2022","Orlando, Egle Maria/0009-0002-5849-6830; Nenna, Federica/0000-0003-0353-6014; Zanardi, Davide/0009-0004-7714-1060; Nannetti, Margherita/0009-0007-3228-7228","European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) - Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.5) [1058]","European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) - Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.5)","This study was carried out within the PNRR research activities of the consortium iNEST (Interconnected North-Est Innovation Ecosystem) funded by the European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) - Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.5 - D.D. 1058 23/06/2022, ECS00000043).

The research explicated in this paper is conducted in a pen recycling unit in the southern part of India which is an initiative by a non-profit organization to reduce plastic waste and highlight the need for recycling. The objectives of the study are two-fold. Firstly, to investigate the influence of cognitive aspects namely information and material presentation on worker performance in an assembly line and secondly to propose an economical worker allocation approach based on the findings of the first study considering the pen recycling unit. An experimental study was conducted with fifteen workers and was given eight different scenarios with the combinations of presenting material and information with six pen varieties for assembly. The performance of workers is identified and appropriate allocations are made to suitable workstations. Further, a subjective measurement using NASA-TLX is also done to determine the mental workload of workers. The results indicate that individual worker performance varies significantly, much more than is assumed. This variation is due to the difference in cognitive capabilities among workers when they are introduced to different product variants and work environments. It is expected that the proposed economical allocation method will be beneficial for similar micro, small and medium enterprises that contribute in achieving sustainability goals.","[Giridhar, M.

A numerical example, considering with five successive reconfigurations, allows to analyse the expected execution time trend for each operator-task pair and the variation in costs obtained as the operators learning rate and the variability of the operations change.","[Butturi, Maria Angela; Lolli, Francesco; Menini, Chiara] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Sci & Methods Engn, Via Amendola 2, Reggio Emilia, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Butturi, MA (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Sci & Methods Engn, Via Amendola 2, Reggio Emilia, Italy.",,"Butturi, Maria Angela/AAQ-6864-2020","Butturi, Maria Angela/0000-0003-1639-6065",,,,,28,0,0,0,4,SCITEPRESS,SETUBAL,"AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-758-476-3,,,,2020,,,,,,,124,131,,10.5220/0010174901240131,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010174901240131,,,8,"Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BT1NR,,hybrid,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000799452300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Industry 5.0 can't be done without fostering a workforce that is not only technologically adept but also has enhanced skills and knowledge. Specifically, collaborative robotics plays a key role in automating strenuous or repetitive tasks, enabling human cognitive functions to contribute to quality and innovation. In manual manufacturing, however, some of these tasks remain challenging to automate without sacrificing quality. In certain situations, these tasks require operators to dynamically organize their mental, perceptual, and gestural activities. In other words, skills that are not yet adequately explained and digitally modeled to allow a machine in an industrial context to reproduce them, even in an approximate manner. Some tasks in welding serve as a perfect example. Drawing from the knowledge of cognitive and developmental psychology, professional didactics, and collaborative robotics research, our work aims to find a way to digitally model manual manufacturing skills to enhance the automation of tasks that are still challenging to robotize. Using welding as an example, we seek to develop, test, and deploy a methodology transferable to other domains.

At the early stage of transitions, human error rate is often high and the impact in quality and production loss can be significant. Over the past years, eXtended Reality (XR) technologies (such as virtual, augmented, immersive, and mixed reality) have become a popular approach to enhance operators' capabilities in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The purpose of this research is to explore the usability of dialogue-based XR enhancement to ease the cognitive burden associated with manufacturing tasks, through the augmentation of linked multi-modal information available to support operators. The proposed Interactive XR architecture, using the Spoken Dialogue Systems' modular and user-centred architecture as a basis, was tested in two use case scenarios: the maintenance of a robotic gripper and as a shop-floor assistant for electric panel assembly. In both cases, we have confirmed a high user acceptance rate with an efficient knowledge communication and distribution even for operators without prior experience or with cognitive impairments, therefore demonstrating the suitability of the solution for assisting human workers in industrial manufacturing processes. The results endorse an initial validation of the Interactive XR architecture to achieve a multi-device and user-friendly experience to solve industrial processes, which is flexible enough to encompass multiple tasks.","[Serras, Manex; Garcia-Sardina, Laura; Simoes, Bruno; Alvarez, Hugo] Vicomtech Fdn, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Mikeletegi 57, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Spain; [Serras, Manex] SPIN UPV EHU, Dept Elect & Elect, Fac Sci & Technol, Campus Leioa, Leioa 48940, Bizkaia, Spain; [Arambarri, Jon] VirtualWare Labs Fdn, Calle Usausuaga 7, Basauri 48970, Spain",,"Serras, M (corresponding author), Vicomtech Fdn, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Mikeletegi 57, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Spain.;Serras, M (corresponding author), SPIN UPV EHU, Dept Elect & Elect, Fac Sci & Technol, Campus Leioa, Leioa 48940, Bizkaia, Spain.",mserras@vicomtech.org; lgarcias@vicomtech.org; bsimoes@vicomtech.org; halvarez@vicomtech.org; jarambarri@virtuawareco.com,"Simões, Bruno/AAJ-7582-2020; Arambarri, Jon/ABG-5299-2021","arambarri, jon/0000-0002-6450-8562; Garcia-Sardina, Laura/0000-0003-4592-8884; Alvarez, Hugo/0000-0002-7262-2197; Simoes, Bruno/0000-0002-0839-5276; Serras, Manex/0000-0003-2945-4789",European Union [723711]; Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government [KK-2017/00080],European Union(European Union (EU)); Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government,This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement with ID 723711 (MANUWORK) and by the Department of Economic Development and Infrastructure of the Basque Government under grant KK-2017/00080 (INICIAR).,,47,23,24,0,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Managing cognitive load through wearable devices in daily life contributes, amongst others, to industrial safety. Wearable bands require high prediction results with less data because of their limited battery and processing power. Therefore, by detecting important features that characterize cognitive load, we aimed to obtain a high load detection classification accuracy using few features. In total, we detected 179 features such as heart rate variabilities, descriptive statistical, and frequency features. Important features were detected using the independent t-test and SHapley additive exPlanation (SHAP). Furthermore, an accuracy of 70.3% was obtained with only ten important features using the LightGBM classifier. Heart rate variability and galvanic skin response were used as the important features. Additionally, the discrete wavelet transform was used as a more important frequency-domain feature than the discrete cosine transform.

A methodology for structured development has been proposed. The draft guidelines have been created starting from the outcomes of a systematic and extended screening of the scientific literature. Preliminary validation has been carried out with the help of researchers working in the field. Inputs on comprehensibility and relevance have been gathered to enhance the guidelines. Lastly, a survey was used to examine in depth how international experts in different branches can interpret such guidelines. In total, 108 responders were asked to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the guideline's comprehensibility and provide general comments or suggestions for each guideline. Based on the survey's results, the guidelines have been validated and some have been reviewed and re-written in their final form.

We developed in-situ projections for three different use cases: (1) assembly support at a workbench, (2) ergonomic lifting, (3) restricted areas, which we studied with 15 representative target users. We found the expected benefits of the task-supporting projection (use case 1), increasing task performance and causing minimal cognitive load. However, our data also suggest that the other projections (use case 2 and 3) did not improve policy compliance. Our findings indicate that in-situ projections are not the most suitable solution to nudge workers to policy compliance in an industrial assembly setting, as most participants ignored the policy after evaluating the dangers themselves. Furthermore, based on our limitations and findings, we reflect on how current study practices can be improved for ubiquitous systems, especially when aiding policy compliance.","[Wedral, Aaron; Vrecar, Rafael; Weiss, Astrid] Tech Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria; [Ebenhofer, Gerhard; Poenitz, Thomas; Wuehrer, Paul H.; Stuebl, Gernot] PROFACTOR GmbH, Steyr Gleink 4407, Upper Austria, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien; Upper Austrian Research GmbH; PROFACTOR,"Wedral, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria.",aaron.wedral@tuwien.ac.at; rafael.vrecar@tuwien.ac.at; gerhard.ebenhofer@profactor.at; thomas.poenitz@profactor.at; paul.wuehrer@profactor.at; astrid.weiss@tuwien.ac.at; gernot.stuebl@profactor.at,,,"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme within the project TEAMING.AI [957402]; country of Upper Austria as part of the FTI strategy, project Zer0P","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme within the project TEAMING.AI; country of Upper Austria as part of the FTI strategy, project Zer0P","This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme within the project TEAMING.AI (grant number 957402) as well as by the country of Upper Austria as part of the FTI strategy, project Zer0P.",,40,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-42282-9; 978-3-031-42283-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2023,14143,,,,,,574,594,,10.1007/978-3-031-42283-6_31,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42283-6_31,,,21,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX4JE,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001290141800031,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are now several different models of humanoid robots available, but operating them remains a difficult challenge. Current operator control interfaces for humanoid robots often require very experienced operators and significant amounts of time for planning. A large amount of the planning and cognitive load is attributable to the operator attempting to gain adequate three-dimensional (3D) situation awareness and task awareness while viewing an interface on a flat, two-dimensional (2D) screen. Virtual reality (VR) has enormous potential to provide benefits to allow the operator to quickly and accurately understand the state of a robot in a scanned 3D environment and to issue accurate commands with less cognitive load. In the gaming sphere, VR headsets remain a new and promising interface for playing video games. In some cases, existing video games are being ported over to VR and, in others, brand new games are being designed with VR in mind. Control schemes and best practices for VR are emerging within the video game industry.

Aiming to address nested and overlapping multitasking and task interruptions, this study investigated their interaction mechanisms on task performance and cognitive load. The study utilized AX-CPT and VFT to form a multitasking situation, and simple math problems with positive and negative judgments to form a task interruption. It tested the task performance of 30 subjects under task interruptions (with interruption vs. without interruption) with different task types (single task vs. multitasking) and analyzed the interaction effects of multitasking and task interruptions on task performance and cognitive load. Finally, the study aimed to verify the moderating role of individual resilience. The results showed that (1) multitasking resulted in a significant decrease in correctness, a significant increase in reaction time, and a significant increase in cognitive load; (2) Task interruptions significantly increased reaction time and cognitive load, while they decreased task correctness only during monotasking; this effect was not significant in multitasking; (3) Moderate and high resilience significantly modulated the increase in cognitive load associated with task interruptions during multitasking. These findings are instrumental in optimizing human-machine collaborative job scheduling, enhancing workflow efficiency, identifying the equilibrium between task performance and cognitive load, and providing crucial support for task management and performance improvement.","[Yuan, Xiaofang; Zhong, Lijuan] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xiaofang] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Human Factors & Management, Xian 710054, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Science & Technology; Xi'an University of Science & Technology,"Zhong, LJ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.",zhonglj0930@163.com,,,The 2023 Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund Annual Program [2023R006]; Department of Science and Technology Youth Project of Shaanxi Province [2020JQ760],The 2023 Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund Annual Program; Department of Science and Technology Youth Project of Shaanxi Province,This research was funded by the [2023 Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund Annual Program] grant number [2023R006] and the [Department of Science and Technology Youth Project of Shaanxi Province] grant number [2020JQ760].,,59,0,0,19,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1046-1310,1936-4733,,CURR PSYCHOL,Curr.

Background Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. Method Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. Results Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by then-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. Conclusion This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times.

However, robots require a high degree of intelligence to operate in those environments, especially if they are not fully structured. Teleoperation compensates for this limitation by connecting the human operator to the robot using human-robot interfaces. The remotely operated sessions can also be used as demonstrations to program more powerful autonomous agents. In this article, we report a thorough user study to characterise the effect of simple vibrotactile feedback on the performance and cognitive load of the human user in performing teleoperated grasping and manipulation tasks. The experiments are performed using a portable and affordable bilateral teleoperation system that we designed, composed of a Leap Motion sensor and a custom-designed vibrotactile haptic glove to operate a 4-fingered robot hand equipped with 3axis force sensors on the fingertips; the software packages we developed are open-source and publicly available.

The shop-floor operators in this future complex manufacturing industry, the Operator 4.0, need to be supported with the implementation of new cognitive automation solutions. These automation solutions, together with the innovativeness of new processes and organizations will increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry.

AR tools appear to be a potential solution to improve interactions between workers and technical data to increase the productivity and the quality of aeronautical maintenance activities. However, assessments of the actual impact of AR on industrial processes are limited due to a lack of methods and tools to assist in the integration and evaluation of AR tools in the field. This paper presents a method for deploying AR tools adapted to maintenance workers and for selecting relevant evaluation criteria of the impact in an industrial context. This method is applied to design an AR tool for the maintenance workshop, to experiment on real use cases, and to observe the impact of AR on productivity and user satisfaction for all worker profiles. Further work aims to generalize the results to the whole maintenance process in the aeronautical industry.

Industry 5.0 will increasingly focus on human-centric approaches, on the collaboration of humans and machines intensively using cognitive assistance systems. The design of an innovative cognitive assistance system is a complex task due to the many technological opportunities and their interrelationships. In the framework of this research, a method was developed enabling the systematic design of cognitive assistance systems that integrates business and worker requirements aiming at improving productivity, quality, worker satisfaction and well-being. The research question was approached by design science research having, as the main output, a systematic and innovative method for the design of cognitive assistance systems based on quality function deployment (QFD), referred to as cognitive assistance system-QFD (CAS-QFD). The developed methodology is divided into six phases and includes the iterative design of a cognitive assistance system starting from the assembly process. The method considers the information needs of the workers, the definition of the appropriate assistance functions and the selection of the interaction technologies. The exemplarily industrial evaluation highlighted the relevance of CAS-QFD for systematically designing cognitive assistance systems based on holistic requirements, identified at the worker, workplace, production area and, finally, at the enterprise level.","[Pokorni, Bastian; Constantinescu, Carmen] Fraunhofer Inst Ind Engn IAO, Fraunhofer IAO, Connected Mfg Syst, Nobelstr 12, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Popescu, Daniela] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Ind Engn Robot & Prod Management, Dept Design Engn & Robot, B Dul Muncii 103-105, Cluj Napoca 400641, Romania",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Technical University of Cluj Napoca,"Pokorni, B (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Ind Engn IAO, Fraunhofer IAO, Connected Mfg Syst, Nobelstr 12, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",bastian.pokorni@iao.fraunhofer.de; daniela.popescu@muri.utcluj.ro; carmen.constantinescu@iao.fraunhofer.de,"Daniela, Popescu/AAP-3495-2021; Pokorni, Bastian/JHT-2032-2023","Pokorni, Bastian/0000-0002-0882-0105",,,,,137,4,4,4,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mappingbased AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/ new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD.","[Eswaran, M.; Bahubalendruni, M. V. A.

Since faster and shorter production cycles lead to higher mental efforts, an alternative to decrease the cognitive load and errors of manual assembly lines is using augmented reality (AR). AR increases system interaction and assists operators in the step-by-step of any tasks performed. Its use allows granular production data, enabling an increase in quality control and timely detection of assembly problems. However, AR alone is not enough to avoid demotivation and lack of engagement in the task, which is repetitive. Gamification can become an auxiliary resource to increase operators' motivation and engagement. This paper presents a system model to integrate AR and gamification for a manual assembly line of printed circuit boards (PCBs) called GRAAL, used to develop an actual system for PCB assembly, which can guide operators using AR but also tracks down their efficiency and efficacy which is then used for gamifying their performance. A prototype system was implemented and assessed by 34 specialist respondents. TAM 3 (Technology Acceptance Model 3) Questionnaire was used to assess the system, which allowed us to find that GRAAL was well accepted (all scores were above the center of a Likert scale from 1 to 7 values), suggesting that GRAAL may be useful as an auxiliary resource to manual assembly lines. We conclude that modeling a system that merges AR and gamification is feasible but a non-trivial task in industry. The system's features are dependent on conditioning factors such as Application Environment, Application Context, Application Audience, AR hardware, and gamification elements.","[Agati, Salvador S.; Hounsell, Marcelo da S.; Paterno, Aleksander S.] Santa Catarina State Univ, Elect Engn Dept, R Paulo Malschitzki 200, BR-89219710 Joinville, SC, Brazil",Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina,"Agati, SS (corresponding author), Santa Catarina State Univ, Elect Engn Dept, R Paulo Malschitzki 200, BR-89219710 Joinville, SC, Brazil.",salvador.agati@edu.udesc.br; marcelo.hounsell@udesc.br; aleksander.paterno@udesc.br,"PATERNO, ALEKSANDER/JMB-7030-2023","Agati, Salvador/0000-0003-4703-9781",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES - Brasil) [001]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq - Brasil) [306613/2022-0]; Institutional Initiation Scholarship Program in Technological Development and Innovation(PIBITI - Brasil); Santa Catarina State Research Support Foundation (FAPESC - Brasil) [2023TR284],Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES - Brasil)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq - Brasil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Institutional Initiation Scholarship Program in Technological Development and Innovation(PIBITI - Brasil); Santa Catarina State Research Support Foundation (FAPESC - Brasil),"This study was partially financed by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES - Brasil) - Finance Code 001 for the doctorate grant; the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq - Brasil), for theDT2 productivity grant, number 306613/2022-0; Institutional Initiation Scholarship Program in Technological Development and Innovation(PIBITI - Brasil); and Santa Catarina State Research Support Foundation (FAPESC - Brasil) for partial funding from the laboratories LARVA-T.O. 2023TR284.",,45,0,0,4,6,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

During the learning of a modeling notation, an individual is confronted with a cognitive load that has an impact on the comprehension of a notation with its underlying formalisms and concepts. To address the cognitive load, this paper presents the results from an exploratory study, in which a sample of 94 participants, divided into novices, intermediates, and experts, needed to assess process models expressed in terms of eight different process modeling notations, i.e., BPMN 2.0, Declarative Process Modeling, eGantt Charts, EPCs, Flow Charts, IDEF3, Petri Nets, and UML Activity Diagrams. The study focus was set on the subjective comprehensibility and accessibility of process models reflecting participant's cognitive load (i.e., mental load and mental effort). Based on the cognitive load, a factor reflecting the mental difficulty for comprehending process models in different modeling notations was derived. The results indicate that established modeling notations from industry (e.g., BPMN) should be the first choice for enterprises when striving for process management. Moreover, study insights may be used to determine which modeling notations should be taught for an introduction in processmodeling or which notation is useful to teach and train process modelers or analysts.","[Zimoch, Michael; Pryss, Ruediger; Reichert, Manfred] Ulm Univ, Inst Databases & Informat Syst, Ulm, Germany; [Probst, Thomas] Danube Univ Krems, Dept Psychotherapy & Biopsycho Hlth, Krems An Der Donau, Austria; [Schlee, Winfried] Regensburg Univ, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Regensburg, Germany",Ulm University; Danube University Krems; University of Regensburg,"Zimoch, M (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Inst Databases & Informat Syst, Ulm, Germany.",michael.zimoch@uni-ulm.de; ruediger.pryss@uni-ulm.de; thomas.probst@donau-uni.ac.at; winfried.schlee@googlemail.com; manfred.reichert@uni-ulm.de,"Probst, Thomas/J-8318-2018; Reichert, Manfred/ABB-4469-2020; Pryss, Rüdiger/AAB-5677-2021; Winter, Michael/L-8362-2019; Schlee, Winfried/C-8983-2011","Schlee, Winfried/0000-0001-7942-1788; Probst, Thomas/0000-0002-6113-2133; Pryss, Rudiger/0000-0003-1522-785X",,,,,36,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-1348,1865-1356,978-3-030-11640-8; 978-3-030-11641-5,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2019,342,,,,,,133,145,,10.1007/978-3-030-11641-5_11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-11641-5_11,,,13,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BX4DS,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001288517800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the level of automation on shop floors increases, it is not always feasible or effective to assign the execution of production tasks to autonomous systems. Where total automation is ineffective, new forms of Human-Technology Integration (HTI), Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) and Augmentation Technologies can empower the workforce and increase overall business productivity. OAS can be conceptualized as systems that interact with operators to augment their cognitive and physical capabilities whilst performing industrial work tasks, resulting in HTI. In order to achieve successful HTI, an organization must make appropriate strategic and operational decisions for its business environment while also effectively managing its operations. Identifying and executing effective managerial decisions and activities for HTI can be aided by using business support, i.e., management tools. However, in industry, the systematic guidance of practitioners in HTI activities remains challenging. This paper addresses the challenge of guiding practitioners in HTI by introducing the Augmented Workforce Canvas (Canvas). Developed through Procedural Action Research (PAR), the Canvas is a strategic technology management tool aimed at systematically guiding users through the complex transformation towards HTI and the future of work on the shop floor. The Canvas takes a value-driven, technology-neutral approach to HTI. The tool begins with an assessment by key stakeholder groups of the set of underlying problems and the required added value of the HTI. It can be used as a methodological framework for industrial researchers to identify their respective contributions to the overall context of HTI in industrial contexts. Building on 39 industry expert interviews, the Canvas was co-designed and developed in 13 workshop sessions, refined and tested in 12 working sessions by industry practitioners, and evaluated in three industry case studies. The Canvas contributes to the development of industrial human-technology systems by placing the value-added for production systems at the heart of management decisions.","[Moencks, Mirco; Roth, Elisa] Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, 17 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England; [Bohne, Thomas] Univ Cambridge, Cyber Human Lab, 17 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England; [Romero, David] Tecnol Monterrey, Ctr Innovat Design & Technol, Av Eugenio Garza Sada 2501 Sur, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Stahre, Johan] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Mat Sci, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Tecnologico de Monterrey; Chalmers University of Technology,"Moencks, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Inst Mfg, 17 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England.",mm2393@cam.ac.uk,"Romero, David/GQA-9701-2022; Stahre, Johan/C-5357-2011","Moncks, Mirco/0000-0003-1108-6455; Romero, David/0000-0003-3610-0751",,,,,92,13,13,1,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

Research on advanced work instructions has encouraged training disabled workers in cognitively demanding production tasks, especially manual assembly. However, studies lack evidence on the effect of repetition or work cycle alongside the form of instruction and type of disability. This paper addresses this gap and reports on an experiment conducted at a sheltered workplace. Four forms of instruction (paper-based, animations, projection, adaptive projection) were tested to assist operators with three types of disability (illiterate, psychosocial, cognitive) with a manual assembly task. The results show that projection enhances the first assembly cycle. Challenging operators by filtering the content of the instruction with increased experience leads to greater independence and a better understanding of their tasks. However, adaptive instructions can form a barrier for those operators who are most dependent on mentor support. The form of instruction should thus be considered carefully for each operator as their adaptation to changes and cognitive assistance systems varies.

In addition, the higher and higher production rates enforced in modern production plants do not allow any human operator to control the process efficiently with traditional tools. Therefore, innovative paradigms and technologies to cope with manufacturing processes must be explored, mainly based on massive adoption of ICT solutions. Inspired by the most recent advances in information and communication technologies developed in the Future Internet framework and, in particular, in the PLATINO project, this paper presents an innovative architectural solution to improve the capabilities and performance of modern production plants: the so-called cognitive middleware for manufacturing. This architectural paradigm aims at stressing the use and integration of ICT technologies (e.g. semantic, middleware, optimization algorithms, ... ) into an holistic framework to be transparently adopted into existing factories as well as embedded in the design of future ones. This solution has been formalized following the guidelines and expectations depicted in the MANUFUTURE Technology Platform SRA, the most valuable EU Organization performing research in this field and represents an innovative cross-fertilization between Future Internet and Future Manufacturing.","[Fiaschetti, Andrea; Pietrabissa, Antonio; Priscoli, Francesco Delli] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn A Ruberti DIA, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Fiaschetti, A (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn A Ruberti DIA, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",fiaschetti@diag.uniroma1.it; pietrabissa@diag.uniroma1.it; priscoli@diag.uniroma1.it,"Pietrabissa, Antonio/P-3883-2019; Pietrabissa, Antonio/F-4567-2011","Pietrabissa, Antonio/0000-0003-0188-3346",,,,,31,1,1,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4673-7359-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,450,454,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BF1IG,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000380399400088,View Full Record in Web of Science

While automation is what drove previous progress in industry, not every process can be automated, therefore, there is still a need for humans to carry out more complex tasks. Thus, in order to increase productivity and efficiency, while maintaining flexibility, robots can assist operators in their tasks rather than replace them. This paper proposes techniques for achieving seamless Human - Robot Collaboration (HRC), with wearable robots equipped with cognitive abilities that make them aware of their environments and the tasks the operator is performing. The main focus is on semi-active exoskeletons with adjustable torque and how they can be made autonomous. Their awareness is powered by computer vision techniques, mainly using anRGB-Dcamera and can automatically adjust the level of assistance they provide to the operator based on what they perceive, rather than having the operator control them directly. Consequently, they do not only improve the workload of the operator, but this assistance is offered without requiring specific actions from the user. This solution mainly focuses on the shipbuilding industry and the various tasks the workers have to perform in which exoskeletons can aid them. Finally, a welding use case is presented demonstrating the various functionalities.","[Kanakis, Alexandros; Katsampiris-Salgado, Konstantinos; Zacharaki, Natalia; Dimitropoulos, Nikos; Makris, Sotiris] Univ Patras, Lab Mfg Syst & Automat, Rion 26504, Greece",University of Patras,"Makris, S (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Lab Mfg Syst & Automat, Rion 26504, Greece.",makris@lms.mech.upatras.gr,"Makris, Sotirios/ADB-7760-2022",,European Union [101006798],European Union(European Union (EU)),This research has been supported by the EU project Mari4_YARD Usercentric solutions for a flexible and modular manufacturing in small and medium-sized shipyards.

This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATE, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry: This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid - from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map - from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs.","[Lu, Yuqian; Zheng, Hao; Chand, Saahil; Xia, Wanqing; Liu, Zengkun; Xu, Xun; Qin, Zhaojun] Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Wang, Lihui] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bao, Jinsong] Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Auckland; Royal Institute of Technology; Donghua University,"Lu, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.",yuqian.lu@auckland.ac.nz,"Lu, Yuqian/U-6820-2019; xun, xu/JGM-9272-2023; Wang, Lihui/O-3907-2014; Xu, Xun/K-7899-2015","Wang, Lihui/0000-0001-8679-8049; Xu, Xun/0000-0001-6294-8153; Zheng, Hao/0000-0003-0388-0755",,,,,158,222,227,66,352,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

Lower levels of autonomy are always available to increase operator comfort. In order to combat cognitive load increases from context switching the control methods take a human-centered approach by automatically adjusting perspective to keep tasks visualized relative to the operator.

The assembly process, characterized by repetitive motions and handling numerous components, can lead to worker overload. Consequently, the inclusion of ergonomic aspects results in an appropriate distribution of assembly operations and relative workloads. This study investigates a multi-objective ALBP aimed at minimizing the number of workstations, overall skill level required, and variance in workers' energy expenditure across workstations. To address the ALBP while considering the ergonomic aspects, this study proposes an approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) using Pareto optimality. A comparative analysis of the NSGA-II and MOSA is conducted in single- and multiproduct production scenarios, and a computational study involving various factors is performed to identify the dominant algorithm. The computational analysis indicates that the runtime performance of MOSA is 73.287% better than that of NSGA-II; therefore, MOSA outperforms NSGA-II.

Although augmented reality devices' characteristics and technological benefits are still evolving, augmented reality's clear advantages in facilitating mechanical tasks and improving operator performance have made it popular. In industrial settings, the human factor remains irreplaceable, but the evolution of artificial intelligence has allowed any activity on the shop floor to be given new semantic possibilities. Through a semantic layer, it is possible to interpret and validate the environment, provide multimodal interaction, and analyze and evaluate information to detect anomalies or risky situations. Deep learning has opened up new possibilities for existing augmented reality solutions, such as visual interpretation of the environment, natural language understanding for problem-solving, or automatic anomaly detection. This new intelligent layer minimizes unnecessary interactions with the environment, validates the operator's actions, and increases comfort, safety, and focus, making them more efficient in high cognitive level tasks. This work presents a general architecture based on a Semantic layer that relies on augmented reality systems and validates its advantages in a real industrial setting. Overall, integrating artificial intelligence and augmented reality solutions in industrial settings offers significant potential for improving productivity, safety, and worker satisfaction.","[Izquierdo-Domenech, Juan; Linares-Pellicer, Jordi; Ferri-Molla, Isabel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencian Res Inst Artificial Intelligence VRAIN, Cami Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Izquierdo-Domenech, J (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencian Res Inst Artificial Intelligence VRAIN, Cami Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",juaizdom@upv.es; jlinares@dsic.upv.es; isfermol@epsa.upv.es,"Izquierdo-Domenech, Juan/AAC-5680-2019","Izquierdo-Domenech, Juan/0000-0003-0076-7001; Ferri-Molla, Isabel/0009-0008-3608-9891",,,,,83,0,0,5,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1380-7501,1573-7721,,MULTIMED TOOLS APPL,Multimed.

Between-subject laboratory experiments involving 20 participants are conducted on a real-life electro-mechanical assembly task to investigate the impacts of various modes of information delivery through AR compared to traditional training methods on task efficiency, number of errors, learning, independence, and cognitive load. The AR application is developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed. Several insights drawn from the experiments and expert interviews are discussed to inform the design of future AR technologies for both training and assisting incumbent and future manufacturing workers on complex manipulation and reasoning tasks.","[Moghaddam, Mohsen] Northeastern Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wilson, Nicholas C.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Adv Teaching & Learning Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Modestino, Alicia Sasser] Northeastern Univ, Coll Social Sci & Humanities, Ctr Hlth Policy & Healthcare Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jona, Kemi] Northeastern Univ, Experiential Digital Global Educ Grp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Marsella, Stacy C.] Northeastern Univ, Khoury Coll Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University,"Moghaddam, M (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",m.moghaddam@northeastern.edu; 3ni.wilson@northeastern.edu; a.modestino@northeastern.edu; k.jona@northeastern.edu; s.marsella@northeastern.edu,,"Wilson, Nicholas/0000-0001-5585-6031",National Science Foundation under the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Fron-tier Grant [2026618]; Division Of Research On Learning; Directorate for STEM Education [2026618] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation under the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Fron-tier Grant; Division Of Research On Learning; Directorate for STEM Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Fron-tier Grant No. 2026618.

However, little is known with respect to two major issues: (i) how these technologies can be seamlessly integrated for product/process and overall manufacturing system management providing of syntactic, semantic and functional interoperability and reusability among the different manufacturing systems departments; (ii) how they can be conveyed to operators also taking into account the cognitive load that is incurred by the operators. To this end, starting from a previous article (Longo et al., 2017), this article designs and proposes the KNOW4I approach and its practical implementation in an ICT platform (the KNOW4I platform) to further empower the Smart Operators concept. Two major objectives are pursued. The former is to set a standard referred to as the KNOW4I methodological approach for knowledge representation, knowledge management and digital contents management within the Smart Operator domain. The latter is the implementation of the aforementioned approach as part of the KNOW4I platform that includes a suite of Smart Utilities and Objects intelligently and interactively linked with a newly released version of the Sophos-MS digital and intelligent Assistant.

This paper argues that the theoretical framework of distributed cognition would greatly benefit the application of HF&E to manufacturing and would offer a more holistic understanding of the interactions between different entities within a greater context, including the social, cultural and materialistic. We aim to characterize and analyse manufacturing as a complex socio-technical system from a distributed cognition perspective; focusing on the use, mediation and integration of different forms of representations, tools and artefacts in this domain. We present illustrative examples from authentic manual assembly, showing the cognitively distributed nature of the work, ranging from scaffolding strategies of the individual worker to the emergent properties of a whole assembly line. The paper further proposes and provides benefits of using a distributed cognition framework as a novel approach in the toolbox for the HF&E discipline, where it may have been found before, but the application to manufacturing has been absent.","[Lindblom, Jessica] Univ Skovde, Sch Informat, Skovde, Sweden; [Thorvald, Peter] Univ Skovde, Sch Engn Sci, Skovde, Sweden",University of Skovde; University of Skovde,"Lindblom, J (corresponding author), Univ Skovde, Sch Informat, Skovde, Sweden.",jessica.lindblom@his.se,"Lindblom, Jessica/GWD-0497-2022; Thorvald, Peter/C-3143-2012","Lindblom, Jessica/0000-0003-0946-7531; Thorvald, Peter/0000-0002-8369-5471",,,,,82,11,11,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2169-3277,,PROD MANUF RES,Prod.

The paper focuses on the design of self-organized production systems cooperating with the humans. A literature review is provided based on two views dealing with such a design: a technical and a human-machine system one. Limits and advantages of both views are presented. A merged view, based on the use of the cognitive work analysis (CWA) approach, is then proposed to ensure an efficient cooperation between the human and a self-organized production system.

However, when telerobots are deployed to complete tasks, the human operator needs to develop task plan and figure out how to execute it using the available control interface. Inappropriate controls can lead to excessive cognitive load and long task completion times. If the human operator can interact with the robot in an intuitive way, he or she can focus more on the task. For that reason, we have designed a human-centered control interface that allows the operator to modify the user perspective, command via hand gestures and natural language, and scale human input motion to any suitable range on the robot. The interface consists of a Leap Motion Controller for hand tracking, microphone for speech detection, and a simple turn knob for varying the scaling factor between the human and robot motions. The teleoperator software utilizes the Robot Operating System (ROS) which enables open-source development and hardware agnosticism. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system by executing a high-precision task of threading a needle. Furthermore, we present results from a usability study in where people were asked to complete high-precision tasks with both the developed human-centered gestural control input and a conventional functionality-centered dragand- drop interface.","[Kruusamaee, Karl; Pryor, Mitch] Univ Texas Austin, Nucl & Appl Robot Grp, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Kruusamäe, K (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Nucl & Appl Robot Grp, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",karl.kruusamae@utexas.edu; mpryor@utexas.edu,,"Kruusamae, Karl/0000-0002-1720-1509; Pryor, Mitch/0000-0001-5089-9964",Research Scholar Program of the Baltic-American Freedom Foundation,Research Scholar Program of the Baltic-American Freedom Foundation,Dr. Karl Kruusamae would like to acknowledge the support from Research Scholar Program of the Baltic-American Freedom Foundation as well as the additional testing opportunities at Southwest Research Institute.,,21,11,12,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2158-2246,,978-1-5090-1729-4,C HUM SYST INTERACT,,,2016,,,,,,,190,196,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BG8HJ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000392278000023,View Full Record in Web of Science

These activities require high levels of adaptability and manual dexterity, requirements that workers can fulfil, thus underscoring their paramount role. However, these tasks are becoming more complex and subjecting workers to greater cognitive strain. In this context, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies that provide cognitive support (cognitive assistive technologies) are essential for reducing cognitive load, facilitating decision-making, improving performance and safeguarding workers' well-being. This study investigates the effectiveness of cognitive assistive technologies through laboratory experiments with 37 participants performing assembly and order picking tasks. Performance and well-being outcomes are evaluated based on task completion time and perceived workload.

We investigated whether optimized parameters increase workplace efficiency and whether adapting these parameters to the individual worker improves workplace outcomes. Three experimental scenarios with different CR parameters were analyzed in terms of the setup time, assembly time, finished products, work in process, and worker utilization. The main results show that personalized CR parameters significantly improve efficiency and productivity. The scenario in which CR parameters were tailored to individual workers, balanced the workload, and minimized worker stress, resulting in higher productivity compared to non-people-centric settings. The study shows that personalization reduces cognitive and physical stress, promotes worker well-being, and is consistent with the principles of human-centered manufacturing. Overall, our research supports the adoption of personalized, collaborative workplace parameters, supported by the mathematical model, to optimize employee efficiency and health, contributing to human-centered and efficient HRC environments.","[Ojstersek, Robert; Buchmeister, Borut; Javernik, Aljaz] Univ Maribor, Fac Mech Engn, Lab Prod & Operat Management, Maribor SI-2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Buchmeister, B (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Mech Engn, Lab Prod & Operat Management, Maribor SI-2000, Slovenia.",robert.ojstersek@um.si; borut.buchmeister@um.si; aljaz.javernik@um.si,"Ojstersek, Robert/GRF-1570-2022","Ojstersek, Robert/0000-0001-6244-3737","Slovenian Research Agency (ARIS) [P2-0190]; Slovenian Research Agency (ARIS), Research Core Funding","Slovenian Research Agency (ARIS); Slovenian Research Agency (ARIS), Research Core Funding","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Slovenian Research Agency (ARIS), Research Core Funding No. P2-0190.",,25,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-1702,,MACHINES,Machines,AUG,2024,12,8,,,,,,,546,10.3390/machines12080546,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines12080546,,,16,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,E8G7Q,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001305337100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 4564 years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers' needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers' wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers' skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This situation gives rise to the interest in developing a framework for the conception of SCMS that allows the integration of the human factor, management, training, and development of the competencies of Operator 4.0 as fundamental aspects of the aforementioned system. The present paper is focused on answering how to conceive the adaptive manufacturing systems of Industry 4.0 through the operation, growth, and development of human talent in VUCA contexts. With this objective, exploratory research is carried, out whose contribution is specified in a framework called Design for the Human Factor in Industry 4.0 (DfHFinI4.0). From among the conceptual frameworks employed therein, the connectivist paradigm, Ashby's law of requisite variety and Vigotsky's activity theory are taken into consideration, in order to enable the affective-cognitive and timeless integration of the human factor within the SCMS. DfHFinI4.0 can be integrated into the life cycle engineering of the enterprise reference architectures, thereby obtaining manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 focused on the human factor.

The fourth industrial revolution is promising increased growth and productivity by the Smart Factory and within the enabling technologies is Augmented Reality (AR). At the same time as the technology is introduced, errors in manufacturing are a problem which is affecting the productivity and the quality. This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation-reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems. Furthermore, the empirical findings showed that for managing human errors, the main bottleneck of an AR system is the systems artificial intelligence capabilities. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Despite human factors are frequently cause of individual biases and errors, a systematic quantitative analysis of the correlation between them and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial disaster has never been conducted. The aim of the present study is twofold: to design an original human factors taxonomy, which encompasses all the industrial worker's cognitive capabilities, physical skills, and psychological attitudes; to establish a correlation between each factor and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial emergency. A Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) analysis has been conducted in collaboration with 44 subject matter experts by using an ad-hoc developed tool to investigate, in particular, two types of workers, the role of emergency manager and the emergency team member. Results reveal that the factors have not the same weight in determining the human response performance: cognitive and psychological aspects have a substantial influence on the emergency manager's response performance, while the emergency team member's response performance is more influenced by psychological and physical aspects. Relevance to industry: Given the crucial role of cognitive, physical and psychological factors in modem human centred industrial systems and especially in the field of industrial safety & security, this study represents a meticulous guide for safety specialists in the design of disaster management strategies, for recruiters and practitioners in the development of competency-based job descriptions and for new research works for the development of personality-gifted intelligent agents in industrial applications.","[Longo, Francesco; Padovano, Antonio] Univ Calabria, DIMEG, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Nicoletti, Letizia] Cal Tek Srl, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"Longo, F (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, DIMEG, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",f.longo@unical.it; l.nicoletti@cal-tek.eu; antonio.padovano@unical.it,"Padovano, Antonio/AAR-6467-2020; Longo, Francesco/C-1182-2013","Longo, Francesco/0000-0002-8538-9857",,,,,42,33,37,0,51,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-8141,1872-8219,,INT J IND ERGONOM,Int.

Studies have shown that work-related accidents are mostly caused by the unsafe behaviors of construction workers, implying that they can be avoided with the appropriate safety training. With emerging technologies being increasingly implemented in the construction industry, there is a growing need to improve pedagogical techniques to equip workers with the multidisciplinary skills required to safely accomplish construction tasks. Construction robots are fine examples of such technologies that necessitate more effective training, as their adoption in the field is closely tied to workers' safety. However, there is a lack of robust safety training methods for working with robots that can ensure the effectiveness of the training process. To address this issue, this study proposes a virtual avatar-based training platform for collaborating with construction robots. The proposed training platform uses workers' physiological signals to evaluate the training process throughout a human-robot collaboration (HRC) task. Using a deep neural network architecture, workers' cognitive load, a crucial factor of effective learning, was identified and linked to safety performance during the HRC task. The study results highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed training platform and its capability to evaluate the cognitive load during the HRC training in construction.","[Shayesteh, Shayan; Ojha, Amit; Liu, Yizhi] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 101 Engn Unit B, University Pk, PA USA; [Shayesteh, Shayan] Penn State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 101 Engn Unit B, University Pk, PA USA; [Liu, Yizhi] Penn State Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 101 Engn Unit B, University Pk, PA USA; [Jebelli, Houtan] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 224 Engn Unit A, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Jebelli, H (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 224 Engn Unit A, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",sks6495@psu.edu; azo5242@psu.edu; ykl5505@psu.edu; hjebelli@psu.edu,"Ojha, Amit/HGB-4715-2022",,,,,,101,29,30,33,140,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

An effective data representation manner, which can fuse such complex information and enable cognitive manufacturing decision making from a global perspective, is necessary and challenging. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive manufacturing and applies it in a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) scenario. Based on the digital thread of manufacturing process data, a multi-layer manufacturing knowledge graph is established, including device sensing data, production processing data, and business processing data. With the established knowledge graph, a cognition-driven approach is proposed with a perception-cognition dual system, which achieves perception analysis and cognition decision making in the resource allocation of the manufacturing process. Finally, responding to the orders of personalized products in a workshop is taken as an illustrative example. The performance of allocating resources of workshop devices under dynamic demand changes shows the advantages of the proposed approach. The proposed manner will lay the foundation for a human-like cognition for processing massive real-time industrial information in CPPS, thus paving a pathway towards the era of cognitive manufacturing.","[Liu, Mingfei; Li, Xinyu; Li, Jie; Liu, Yahui; Zhou, Bin; Bao, Jinsong] Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China",Donghua University,"Li, XY; Bao, JS (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",lixinyu@dhu.edu.cn; bao@dhu.edu.cn,"LI, XINYU/S-5783-2019; Liu, Mingfei/A-4081-2009",,National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFB1706300],National Key R&D Program of China,Acknowledgment This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (No.2019YFB1706300) .,,55,45,47,17,138,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-0346,1873-5320,,ADV ENG INFORM,Adv.

Following Cognitive Load Theory and Attention Theory, AR assistance can reduce the burden on workers' mental capacity while performing a task, thereby improving task performance. The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors.","[Seeliger, Arne; Netland, Torbjorn] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Prod & Operat Management, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cheng, Long] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Innovat Ctr Virtual Real, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Seeliger, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Prod & Operat Management, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",aseeliger@ethz.ch,"Cheng, Long/G-5027-2011",,,,,,54,10,10,11,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-3615,1872-6194,,COMPUT IND,Comput.

However, most research involving human cognition in software engineering is focused on the evaluation of programs and learning instead of how the source code could be developed under this perspective. This paper presents an approach called Cognitive-Driven Development (CDD) that is based on cognitive complexity measurements and Cognitive Load Theory. This strategy can reduce the cognitive overload of the developers through the limitation of intrinsic complexity points from source code. Some cognitive complexity metrics has been extended and guidelines are presented to calculate the intrinsic complexity points and how their limit can be adapted under certain quality criteria. Experimental studies are currently being conducted to evaluate the CDD. Preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce the future effort for maintenance and fixing software faults.","[Oliveira Tavares de Souza, Alberto Luiz; Santiago Costa Pinto, Victor Hugo] Zup Innovat Acad, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,"de Souza, ALOT (corresponding author), Zup Innovat Acad, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",alberto.tavares@zup.com.br; victor.pinto@zup.com.br,"Pinto, Victor/AAS-9332-2021",,,,,,21,4,4,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1063-6773,,978-1-7281-5619-4,PROC IEEE INT CONF S,,,2020,,,,,,,776,778,,10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00087,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00087,,,3,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BQ6TH,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000613139300077,View Full Record in Web of Science

A highly compatible concept for enabling the I5.0 implementation is intelligent spaces (ISs), i.e., physical spaces equipped with a network of sensors, which obtains information about the place it observes, and a network of actuators, which enables changes in the environment through computing services. These spaces can sense, interpret, recognize user behavior, adapt to preferences, and provide natural interactions between humans and intelligent systems, using the IoT, AI, computer vision, data analytics, etc., to create dynamic and adaptive environments in real time. The integration of ISs and I5.0 has paved the way for the development of cognitive factories, which transform industrial environments into ISs. In this context, this article explores the convergence of IS and I5.0 concepts and aims to provide insights into the technical implementation challenges of cognitive factories. It discusses the development and implementation of a laboratory replica of a cognitive cell as an example of a segment of a cognitive factory. By analyzing the key points and challenges associated with cognitive cell implementation, this article contributes to the knowledge base surrounding the advanced manufacturing paradigm of I5.0.","[Cotta, Wagner Augusto Aranda; Lopes, Sergio Ivan] CiTin Ctr Interface Tecnol Ind, P-4970786 Arcos De Valdevez, Portugal; [Cotta, Wagner Augusto Aranda; Vassallo, Raquel Frizera] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Elect Engn, BR-29075910 Vitoria, Brazil; [Lopes, Sergio Ivan] Inst Politecn Viana Castelo, ADiT Lab, P-4900348 Viana Do Castelo, Portugal",Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo,"Cotta, WAA (corresponding author), CiTin Ctr Interface Tecnol Ind, P-4970786 Arcos De Valdevez, Portugal.;Cotta, WAA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Elect Engn, BR-29075910 Vitoria, Brazil.",waacotta@gmail.com; sraquel.vassalo@ufes.br; raquel.vassalo@ufes.br,"Lopes, Sergio Ivan/V-1742-2018","Lopes, Sergio Ivan/0000-0001-6944-7757","Missao Interface [03/C05-i02/2022]; Technology and Innovation Centers (CTI) as part of the Portuguese Plano de Recuperacao e Resiliencia (PRR); Norte Portugal Regional Operational Program (NORTE 2020) under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Social Fund (ESF) [NORTE-06-3559-FSE-000226]","Missao Interface; Technology and Innovation Centers (CTI) as part of the Portuguese Plano de Recuperacao e Resiliencia (PRR); Norte Portugal Regional Operational Program (NORTE 2020) under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Social Fund (ESF)","& nbsp;This work received funding from Missao Interface, under the call No 03/C05-i02/2022, which provides public base funding for Technology and Innovation Centers (CTI) as part of the Portuguese Plano de Recuperacao e Resiliencia (PRR).

Vision-based hand gesture recognition has been effectively applied as the interface between humans and computer for long time. So, this paper presents a survey of the vision-based hand gesture recognition research in human-robot collaborative manufacturing. We first propose an overall model of vision-based hand gesture recognition for human-robot collaboration. Then, we review three essential technical components of this model: sensor technologies, hand gesture detection and segmentation and hand gesture classification. In addition, the relevant techniques for vision-based hand gesture recognition are compared.

Through analyzing five real-life production cases in different industries, similarities and differences in their corresponding needs are identified.

Robotic teleoperation is often preferred when manipulating objects in extreme conditions. In many applications, e.g., hazardous and high-consequence environments, operators cannot directly perceive the robot motions and have to rely only on CCTV views of the scene for situational awareness while teleoperating the heavy-duty industrial robots. Making best guesses for the IK plays a significant role on the task success rate and increases the operator cognitive load significantly. In this context, we develop a new optimisation-based IK solver that is robust with respect to the robot's singularities and assists the operator in generating smooth trajectories. Inspired by a successful algorithm used in computer graphics to solve the IK problem and devise smooth movements (FABRIK), our algorithm takes advantage also of the kinematic structure of the robot in order to decouple the notoriously difficult IK problem of orientation and position. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have compared its performance to that of the commonly used Jacobian pseudo inverse-based method in terms of positional accuracy and task-space reachability. We also report the results of telemanipulation experiments with human test-subjects. Our proposed IK algorithm outperforms classical IK methods on both objective metrics of task success, and subjective metrics of operator preference.","[Ortenzi, Valerio; Marturi, Naresh; Rajasekaran, Vijaykumar; Adjigble, Maxime; Stolkin, Rustam] Univ Birmingham, Sch Met & Mat, Extreme Robot Lab, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Ortenzi, V (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Met & Mat, Extreme Robot Lab, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",v.ortenzi@bham.ac.uk; n.marturi@bham.ac.uk; v.rajasekaran@bham.ac.uk; m.k.j.adjigble@bham.ac.uk; r.stolkin@bham.ac.uk,"Marturi, Naresh/AAS-6956-2021; Ortenzi, Valerio/AAJ-2092-2021; Rajasekaran, Vijaykumar/B-8290-2014","Marturi, Naresh/0000-0002-0159-167X","H2020 RoMaNS [645582]; EPSRC [EP/R02572X/1, EP/P017487/1, EP/P01366X/1]; Royal Society Industry Fellowship",H2020 RoMaNS; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Royal Society Industry Fellowship(Royal Society),"This work forms part of the UK National Centre for Nuclear Robotics initiative, funded by EPSRC EP/R02572X/1.

Several hazards exist when workers are within the robots' working envelope, including high mental stress induced by the robot as well as the risk of physical collision. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes a cyber-physical system (CPS) for safe, worker-centered human-robot collaboration (HRC). The physical components of the CPS include a wearable biosensor for assessing workers' mental conditions and a video camera for evaluating the risk of collision accidents. The cyber component incorporates a machine learning layer that employs a kernelized logistic regression to translate worker bio-signals into distinct physiological states. Simultaneously, the system monitors the relative distance between workers and robots by applying computer vision techniques (i.e., video frame differencing, dilation, and contour detection). To test the feasibility of the proposed CPS, six subjects were asked to perform a series of bricklaying tasks jointly with a vehicle robot with different risks of collision (various distances from the robot) and at different levels of cognitive load (various tasks' complexity). The findings revealed that the proposed CPS allows the co-bot to adjust its speed relative to the subject's physiological states with 93.70% accuracy. In addition, the proposed system shows promising performance in collision avoidance with the accurate monitoring of position between robots and humans. The results unfold the feasibility of the proposed CPS in enhancing safe and intelligent HRC in construction under the trend of Industry 4.0.","[Liu, Yizhi; Habibnezhad, Mahmoud; Jebelli, Houtan] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, State Coll, PA 16801 USA; [Monga, Vishal] Penn State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Coll, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Liu, YZ (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.",ykl5505@psu.edu; mahmoud@psu.edu; hjebelli@psu.edu; vum4@psu.edu,,,,,,,18,5,5,3,7,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8389-3,,,,2022,,,,,,,1075,1083,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BU8LH,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000948933100132,View Full Record in Web of Science

While high automation improves performance when functioning correctly, it can lead to problematic human performance (e.g., defect detection accuracy, response time) when operators are required to intervene and assume manual control of decision-making responsibilities. As AI capability reaches higher levels of automation and human-AI collaboration becomes ubiquitous, addressing these performance issues is crucial. Proper worker training, focusing on skill-based, cognitive, and affective outcomes, and nurturing motivation and engagement, can be a mitigation strategy. However, most training research in manufacturing has prioritized the effectiveness of a technology for training, rather than how training design influences motivation and engagement, key to training success and longevity. The current study explored how training workers using an AI system affected their motivation, engagement, and skill acquisition. Specifically, we manipulated the level of automation of decision selection of an AI used for the training of 102 participants for a quality control task. Findings indicated that fully automated decision selection negatively impacted perceived autonomy, self-determined motivation, behavioral task engagement, and skill acquisition during training. Conversely, partially automated AI-enhanced motivation and engagement, enabling participants to better adapt to AI failure by developing necessary skills. The results suggest that involving workers in decision-making during training, using AI as a decision aid rather than a decision selector, yields more positive outcomes. This approach ensures that the human aspect of manufacturing work is not overlooked, maintaining a balance between technological advancement and human skill development, motivation, and engagement. These findings can be applied to enhance real-world manufacturing practices by designing training programs that better develop operators' technical, methodological, and personal skills, though companies may face challenges in allocating substantial resources for training redevelopment and continuously adapting these programs to keep pace with evolving technology.","[Passalacqua, Mario; Pellerin, Robert] Polytech Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Yahia, Esma; Rosin, Frederic] Arts & Metiers ParisTech, LISPEN, Aix en Provence, France; [Yahia, Esma; Rosin, Frederic] Arts & Metiers ParisTech, DynEO, Aix en Provence, France; [Magnani, Florian] Univ Aix Marseille, Ecole Cent Mediterranee, CERGAM, Marseille, France; [Joblot, Laurent] HESAM Univ, Arts & Metiers Inst Technol, LISPEN, UBFC, Chalon sur Saone, France; [Leger, Pierre-Majorique] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology; Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology; Aix-Marseille Universite; heSam Universite; Universite de Bourgogne; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Passalacqua, M (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",mario.passalacqua@polymtl.ca,"Magnani, Florian/ABB-4811-2021; Passalacqua, Mario/HHM-6008-2022; Magnani, Florian/HTO-5461-2023","Pellerin, Robert/0000-0001-7486-3579; Passalacqua, Mario/0000-0002-9730-6342; YAHIA, Esma/0000-0002-1726-8965; Magnani, Florian/0000-0002-5970-2221; joblot, laurent/0000-0003-4918-128X",Institute for Data Valorization (IVADO),Institute for Data Valorization (IVADO),No Statement Available,,114,1,1,29,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1044-7318,1532-7590,,INT J HUM-COMPUT INT,Int.

Nowadays the current hype on development and industrial adoption of the AI systems is mostly associated with the deep learning, i.e., with the abilities of the AI to perform various specific cognitive activities better than humans do. However, what about the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), associated with the generic ability of a machine to perform consciously any task that a human can? Do we have many samples of the AGI research adopted by Industry 4.0 and used for smart manufacturing? In this paper, we report the systematic mapping study regarding the AGI-related papers (published during the five-year period) to find out whether AGI is giving up its positions within AI as an attractive tool to address the industry needs. We show what the major concerns of the AGI academic community are nowadays and how the AGI findings have been already or could be potentially applied within the Industry 4.0. We have discovered that the gap between the AGI studies and the industrial needs is still high and even has some indications to grow.

Most industrial accidents occur today due to human error. For safe and efficient operation, it is therefore critical to ensure optimal operator performance. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and concomitant digitalization, the role of operators has become cognitively challenging. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the cognitive performance of operators. One of the major constructs to understand cognitive performance is the cognitive workload. An increase in cognitive workload often leads to degradation in performance. Traditional assessment techniques fail to capture cognitive aspects of performance. Recently, researchers in various domains such as aviation, driving, marine, and nuclear power have started to utilize physiological measures to gauge the cognitive workload of their operators. In our previous works, we have used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking separately to assess the cognitive workload of operators in the process industries. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the benefits of their fusion in classifying process industry control room operators' workload into low, medium, and high classes while they tackle abnormal situations. The methodology employs the fusion of metrics derived from pupil, gaze, and EEG data to train a decision tree-based model for workload classification. Our results reveal that fusion leads to an increase in classification accuracy of upto 22 %. The work has the potential to identify the expertise level of operators and hence, can be critical in ensuring their optimal performance.","[Iqbal, Mohd Umair] Indian Inst Technol Gandhinagar, Dept Chem Engn, Gandhinagar 382355, India; [Srinivasan, Babji] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Appl Mech, Chennai 600036, India; [Iqbal, Mohd Umair; Srinivasan, Rajagopalan] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Chem Engn, Chennai 600036, India; [Srinivasan, Babji; Srinivasan, Rajagopalan] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Amer Express Lab Data Analyt Risk & Technol, Chennai 600036, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Srinivasan, B; Srinivasan, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Amer Express Lab Data Analyt Risk & Technol, Chennai 600036, India.",babji.srinivasan@iitm.ac.in; raj@iitm.ac.in,"Srinivasan, Rajagopalan/B-5322-2010","Srinivasan, Rajagopalan/0000-0002-8790-4349","American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","This work is partially funded by the American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600036, India.",,81,4,4,9,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0098-1354,1873-4375,,COMPUT CHEM ENG,Comput.

It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eyetracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages.","[Zhu, Qi; Shi, Yangming] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 454A Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Du, Jing] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wei, Paul] Univ Florida, Dept Comp & Informat Sci & Engn, 432 Newell Dr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",qizhu@ufl.edu; eric.du@essie.ufl.edu; shiyangming@ufl.edu; pwei1@ufl.edu,"Du, Jing/AHE-6199-2022; Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024; Shi, Yangming/AAT-8768-2021",,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [1937053, 2024784]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [2024784] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities [1937053] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA))","This material is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants 1937053 and 2024784.

In work environments 4.0, the operators' role is drastically changed. There is increasing utilisation of innovative devices, and new technologies have changed work activities into more cognitive than physical tasks. According to scientific studies in the new industrial era, the operators' skill to process the information related to a single task plays a crucial role in improving the manufacturing systems' effectiveness. The methods available in scientific literature to assess the operator's performance are mainly focused on the cognitive and physical efforts required by the task. In other words, they depend on tasks complexity and neglect human behaviour over time and the workers' abilities. Therefore, an evaluation including the skills and properness of a specific operator to perform an assigned task needs more investigation. Consistent with this research gap, the paper aims to develop an information-based theoretical model allowing to estimate an operator's performance index to accomplish an assembly job by evaluating both the tasks' complexity and the operator's skill. The model is applied to an automotive company to test and evaluate the potential applications of the methodology that go beyond the case study developed. The results proved the effectiveness of the model in estimating the operators' performance, providing a job schedule based on task complexity and workers' abilities.","[Facchini, Francesco; Cavallo, Daniela] Polytech Univ Bari, Bari, Italy; [Mummolo, Giovanni] Univ Bari, Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Facchini, F (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Bari, Bari, Italy.",francesco.facchini@poliba.it,"Facchini, Francesco/X-6097-2019","FACCHINI, Francesco/0000-0001-5783-7651; Cavallo, Daniela/0000-0003-4544-5815; MUMMOLO, Giovanni/0000-0003-4781-0804",,,,,30,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-1009,,978-3-031-14765-4; 978-3-031-14763-0; 978-3-031-14762-3,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2022,400,,,,,,193,205,,10.1007/978-3-031-14763-0_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-14763-0_16,,,13,"Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BU6UI,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000929603600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The cognitive behavior of DCS HCI is studied to clarify the interaction process and influencing factors during DCS operation and monitoring tasks. The test indexes and methods based on eye movement data and subjective fatigue data are proposed. The DCS HCI cognitive performance test procedure is designed by combining eye tracking tests and subjective fatigue tests. The DCS HCI cognitive performance of a black background and a gray background is tested and compared. The results show that the gray background DCS HCI has an advantage in cognitive performance, and the black background DCS HCI brings higher cognitive fatigue and lower efficiency. This method is significant in reducing the cognitive load and improving the interaction efficiency for DCS HCI.","[Yu, K.] China Ship Dev & Design Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Yu, K (corresponding author), China Ship Dev & Design Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN, 2301 EH, NETHERLANDS",,,978-0-429-46860-5; 978-1-138-60427-8,,,,2019,,,,,,,85,91,,,,,,7,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering,BN1PX,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000474921500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This approach is going to be designed with the Design of Experiments (DoE) method. Therefore, the respective goals and factors are going to be determined. The environment will be the laboratories of the University of Applied Sciences Amberg-Weiden and its Campus for Digitalization in Amberg. In detail, there will be a sample assembly process from the automotive supplier industry for demonstration purposes. At this laboratory, the MES software from the European benchmark SAP is installed, and the respective standard Production Operator Desk is going to be used with slight adaptions. In order to make the cognitive ergonomics measurable, different approaches are going to be used. For instance, body temperature, heart rate and skin conductance as well as subjective methods of self-assessment are planned. The result of this paper is a ready-to-run experiment with sample data for each classification of participants. Further, possible limitations and adjustments are going to be discussed.

Operators in this environment, Operator 4.0, will share knowledge through the use of new digital technologies that should be implemented in parallel with an organizational development towards Organization 4.0. On an individual level within the organization, people benefit from understanding their own knowledge needs and gain necessary knowledge through knowledge sharing activities. In pre-Industry 4.0 organizations, this is done primarily through meetings. Originally developed to create smart meetings in smart factories, an elaborated version of the MEET model (Gullander et al, 2014) is used in this paper to evaluate the needs for sharing of tacit and explicit knowledge, both in regards to how it affects the Information System and the Organization System. By adding a systematic process approach to mapping individual knowledge needs related to production activities, these needs can be identified for each process step. By using this systematic approach to apply the MEET model, two Swedish SMEs within the manufacturing industry have developed their knowledge sharing activities. This human-centred study, based on questionnaires and interviews, focuses on how shop-floor operators perceive changes in knowledge sharing activities due to the use of the MEET model. Novelty in this research lies in the attempt to link the technology-intensive Industry 4.0 development with an organizational emphasis. Results show that the applied method can be used to pragmatically improve knowledge sharing from certain aspects, but further research is required to determine the correlation between different areas and their effect on knowledge sharing.

Thus, the objective of this study is to understand the EEG variations underpinning the reactions of drinkers and drowsy persons during multitasking cognitive performance. An experimental task was performed which included multitasking, working memory and real time EEG signals recorded. Quantitative EEG (absolute and relative powers of the seven bands) was analyzed for 10 college students (five subjects with 0.05% Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) and five with less than one hour of sleep). The same experiment was performed again when each of the subjects had a normal health status (0% BAC and their typical sleep duration). The results indicated a statistical difference in cognitive performance depending on their physical status.

While VR training has been adopted in many environments, such as heavy industry, surgery and aviation, there remains an inadequate understanding of how virtual simulations impact cognitive factors. One such factor, which needs careful consideration during the design of VR simulations, is the degree of mental or cognitive load experienced during training. This study aimed to validate a newly developed measure of workload, based on existing instruments (e.g. the NASA-TLX), but tailored to the specific demands placed on users of simulated environments. While participants completed a VR puzzle game, a series of experimental manipulations of workload were used to assess the sensitivity of the new instrument. The manipulations affected the questionnaire subscales (mental demands; physical demands; temporal demands; frustration; task complexity; situational stress; distraction; perceptual strain; task control; presence) as predicted in all cases (ps < .05), except for presence, which displayed little relationship with other aspects of task load. The scale was also found to have good convergent validity with an alternate index of task load. The findings support the sensitivity of the new instrument for assessing task load in virtual reality. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of mental workload in simulated environments and provides a practical tool for use in both future research and applications in the field.","[Harris, David; Wilson, Mark; Vine, Samuel] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Harris, D (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England.",d.j.harris@exeter.ac.uk,"Vine, Samuel/AAD-5226-2019; Harris, David/H-9114-2019","Harris, David/0000-0003-3880-3856",Royal Academy of Engineering Postdoctoral Fellowship; NVIDIA equipment grant,Royal Academy of Engineering Postdoctoral Fellowship; NVIDIA equipment grant,This work was supported by a Royal Academy of Engineering Postdoctoral Fellowship and an NVIDIA equipment grant awarded to D Harris.,,39,63,68,8,34,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1359-4338,1434-9957,,VIRTUAL REAL-LONDON,Virtual Real.,DEC,2020,24,4,,,,,557,566,,10.1007/s10055-019-00422-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10055-019-00422-9,,DEC 2019,10,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,OC5AD,,hybrid,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000542936700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.","[Hopko, Sarah K.; Mehta, Ranjana K.] Texas A&M Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Mehta, Ranjana K.; Pagilla, Prabhakar R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mech Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Mehta, RK (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",rmehta@tamu.edu,"Mehta, Ranjana/AAE-3257-2020","Mehta, Ranjana/0000-0002-8254-8365; Hopko, Sarah/0000-0003-4713-4455",National Science Foundation [1900704],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1900704 (Augmenting Human Cognition with Collaborative Robots).,,66,15,15,10,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept. The proof of concept of force control yields good transient responses, short settling times and acceptable steady-state error.

Consequently, businesses from different sectors were forced to work remotely. At the same time, research in this area has seen a rise in studying and emerging technologies that allow and promote such a remote working style; not every sector is equipped for such a transition. The manufacturing sector especially, has faced challenges in this respect. This paper investigates the mental workload (MWL) of two groups of participants through a human-machine interaction task. Participants were required to bring a robotised cell to full production by tuning system and dispensing process parameters. Following the experiment, a self-assessment of the participants' perceived MWL using the raw NASA Task Load Index (RTLX) was collected. The results reveal that remote participants tend to have a lower perceived workload compared to the local participants, but mental demand was deemed higher while performance was rated lower.","[Zimmer, Melanie; Al-Yacoub, Ali; Ferreira, Pedro; Hubbard, Ella-Mae; Lohse, Niels] Loughborough Univ, Intelligent Automat Ctr, Wolfson Sch, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Al-Yacoub, A (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Intelligent Automat Ctr, Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",a.al-yacoub@lboro.ac.uk,"Lohse, Niels/AAB-6597-2021; Ferreira, Pedro/JVN-2767-2024; Hubbard, Ella-Mae/I-4291-2014","Lohse, Niels/0000-0001-7279-8849; Al-Yacoub, Ali/0000-0003-2010-9882",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L014998/1]; EPSRC [EP/R032718/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L014998/1].,,26,0,0,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2169-3277,,PROD MANUF RES,Prod.

Generally accepted roles and implementation recipes of cyber systems are expected to be standardized in the future of manufacturing industry. The authors intend to develop a novel CPS-enabled control architecture that accommodates: (1) intelligent information systems involving domain knowledge, empirical model, and simulation; (2) fast and secured industrial communication networks; (3) cognitive automation by rapid signal analytics and machine learning (ML) based feature extraction; (4) interoperability between machine and human. Semantic integration of process indicators is fundamental to the success of such implementation. This work proposes an automated semantic integration of data-intensive process signals that is deployable to industrial signal-based control loops. The proposed system rapidly infers manufacturing events from image-based data feeds, and hence triggers process control signals. Two image inference approaches are implemented: cloud-based ML model query and edge-end object shape detection. Depending on use cases and task requirements, these two approaches can be designated with different event detection tasks to provide a comprehensive system self-awareness. Coupled with conventional industrial sensor signals, machine vision system can rapidly understand manufacturing scenes, and feed extracted semantic information to a manufacturing ontology developed by either expert or ML-enabled cyber systems. Moreover, extracted signals are interpreted by Programmable Logical Controllers (PLCs) and field devices for cognitive automation towards fully autonomous industrial systems.","[Xia, Kaishu; Saidy, Clint; Kirkpatrick, Max; Anumbe, Noble; Harik, Ramy] Univ South Carolina, Coll Engn & Comp, McNAIR Ctr Aerosp Innovat & Res, Dept Mech Engn, 1000 Catawba St, Columbia, SC 29201 USA; [Kirkpatrick, Max] Siemens Digital Ind Software, Charlotte, NC 28277 USA; [Sheth, Amit] Univ South Carolina, Coll Engn & Comp, Artificial Intelligence Inst, Columbia, SC 29201 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Harik, R (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Coll Engn & Comp, McNAIR Ctr Aerosp Innovat & Res, Dept Mech Engn, 1000 Catawba St, Columbia, SC 29201 USA.",kxia@email.sc.edu; csaidy@mailbox.sc.edu; max.kirkpatrick@siemens.com; anumbe@email.sc.edu; amit@sc.edu; harik@mailbox.sc.edu,"Sheth, Amit/ABC-4600-2020; Anumbe, Noble/ACG-7508-2022","Anumbe, Noble/0000-0003-0042-9563; Xia, Kaishu/0000-0001-8216-6597; Sheth, Amit/0000-0002-0021-5293","South Carolina Research Authority (SCRA) [10009353, 10009367]",South Carolina Research Authority (SCRA),"This research was funded by the South Carolina Research Authority (SCRA), grant number 10009353 and 10009367.

Traditional design approaches are based on the observation of individual workers performing their jobs, the detection of unnatural postures (e.g., bending, twisting, overextending, rotating), and the definition of late corrective actions according to ergonomic guidelines. Recently, computer-integrated simulations based on virtual prototypes and digital human models (DHMs) can be used to assess manufacturing ergonomics on virtual manikins operating in digital workplaces. Such simulations allow validating different design alternatives and optimizing the workstation design before the creation, and pave the way to a new approach to manufacturing system design. The present paper aims at comparing different computer-integrated set-ups to support the design of human-centred manufacturing workstations. It defines a protocol analysis to support workstation design by analysing both physical and cognitive aspects, and applies the protocol within different digital set-ups. In particular, the study investigates a 2D desktop set-up using standardized DHMs and a 3D immersive mixed reality set-up based on motion capture of real workers' acting into a mixed environment, comparing them with the traditional approach. An industrial case study focusing on design optimization of a manufacturing workstation in the energy industry is used to test the effectiveness of the two digital set-ups for the definition of re-design actions.","[Peruzzini, Margherita; Pellicciari, Marcello; Gadaleta, Michele] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Engn Enzo Ferrari, Modena, MO, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Peruzzini, M (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Engn Enzo Ferrari, Modena, MO, Italy.",margherita.peruzzini@unimore.it,"Pellicciari, Marcello/AAE-9293-2020; Peruzzini, Margherita/K-8165-2013",,,,,,40,43,44,3,890,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

When looking at the vision of Augmented Reality especially binocular see-through smart glasses can be useful for this purpose. Therefore, a strong focus should be put on the analysis of information and interaction design as well as its influence on cognitive load and visual comfort when using it in the working environment. Consequently, two systematic reviews are implemented to examine how to ensure the usability of smart devices and which influence factors on human strain exist due to the information and interaction design of smart glasses. The aim of the reviews is to identify the need of further research in the mentioned topics and derive an experimental setup for investigations on binocular see-through smart glasses. Results indicate that the established usability methods and criteria of conventional screen work are still adequate, but they have to be adjusted to the rapid development of new technologies. As potential influence factors on human strain the accommodation-convergence conflict and the positioning of information for primary as well as secondary task instructions are identified. Furthermore, the question arises, if the possibility to individualize the information provision based on users' needs is helpful to support learning effects and optimize mental strain. Therefore a laboratory study will be carried out, which investigate the described effects.

Modern IPenabled sensors, actuators, and controllers are transforming industrial automation into industry 5.0 compliances to attain full autonomy with minimal human intervention. With these emerging technologies, Smart CyberPhysical System (SCPS) is the most important part of the fourth industrial revolution, where diffident programmed embedded systems are networked together to perform, computation, communication, control, and actuation. In this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous architecture for SCPS, where different electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes can be integrated to execute hybrid process dynamics. The proposed architecture is enabled to separate all aspects like computation, control, communication, and actuation, of a process dynamic by estimating the process disturbances, sensor delay, actuator delay, and conversion delay. The allotment of computational embedded cores to different physical processes is done through voltage frequency islands (VFI) with high modularity which is different for different processes. All the mapped process dynamics are optimized through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS).

The automotive industry urgently needs to redefine the human-vehicle interaction relationship. In this paper, we construct an interaction design set concept, sort out the interaction-related factors of autonomous driving scenarios, and establish a human-centered intelligent cockpit ring interaction set and a vehicle-centered autonomous driving ring interaction set. The relationship between driving tasks, cognitive contention, user experience and human-machine ergonomics is explored. Visualization through the sets redefines the design methodology and evaluation methodology of interaction systems for present and future autonomous driving scenarios, providing guidance to designers.","[Cui, Mingyu; Zhang, Kejia] Tsinghua Univ, Future Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yahui] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Zhang, KJ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Future Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China.",354083048@qq.com,,"Cui, Mingyu/0009-0002-0720-7680",,,,,17,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-60476-8; 978-3-031-60477-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2024,14732,,,,,,101,115,,10.1007/978-3-031-60477-5_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-60477-5_8,,,15,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX3OA,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001283348300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the readiness of 'Self-X' levels (e.g., self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adjust/adaptive/healing) is still in the infant stage. To pave its way, this work stepwise introduces an industrial knowledge graph (IKG)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for achieving the Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. Firstly, an IKG should be formulated based on the extracted empirical knowledge and recognized patterns in the manufacturing process, by exploiting the massive human-generated and machine-sensed multimodal data. Then, a proposed graph neural network-based embedding algorithm can be performed based on a comprehensive understanding of the established IKG, to achieve semantic-based self-configurable solution searching and task decomposition. Moreover, a MARL-enabled decentralized system is presented to self-optimize the manufacturing process, and to further complement the IKG towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. An illustrative example of multi-robot reaching task is conducted lastly to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. As an explorative study, limitations and future perspectives are also highlighted to attract more open discussions and in-depth research for ever smarter manufacturing.","[Zheng, Pai; Xia, Liqiao; Li, Chengxi] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Chengxi] Hong Kong Sci Pk, Lab Artificial Intelligence Design, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinyu] Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinyu; Liu, Bufan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore, Singapore",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Donghua University; Nanyang Technological University,"Zheng, P (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Li, XY (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",pai.zheng@polyu.edu.hk; cash.li@ntu.edu.sg,"ZHENG, PAI/K-7989-2012; Xia, Liqiao/IWU-6471-2023; Li, Chengxi/CAG-9066-2022; LI, XINYU/S-5783-2019","ZHENG, PAI/0000-0002-2329-8634; Li, Chengxi/0000-0003-1921-7448; Liu, Bufan/0000-0002-2683-0139; Li, Xinyu/0000-0002-4117-9698","National Natural Research Foundation of China [52005424]; Innovation and Technology Commission, HKSAR, China; National Key R&D Programs of Cooperation on Scientific and Technological Innovation in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan [SQ2020YFE020182]; Jiangsu Provincial Policy Guidance Program (Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation) [BZ2020049]; Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme [MHX/001/20]","National Natural Research Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation and Technology Commission, HKSAR, China; National Key R&D Programs of Cooperation on Scientific and Technological Innovation in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan; Jiangsu Provincial Policy Guidance Program (Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation); Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme","The authors wish to acknowledge the funding support from the National Natural Research Foundation of China (No. 52005424), Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme (MHX/001/20), Innovation and Technology Commission, HKSAR, China, National Key R&D Programs of Cooperation on Scientific and Technological Innovation in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (SQ2020YFE020182), and Jiangsu Provincial Policy Guidance Program (Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation, BZ2020049).",,75,109,115,16,144,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

However, it remains largely unclear how virtual learning environments can be engineered to achieve measurable improvements in the learners' performance. To advance the development and application of VR learning technologies, we systematized instruction principles from the literature known to be congruent with cognitive and affective learning outcomes. We then combined these principles and designed a VR training program, which we subsequently tested in a large first-person VR experiment and real-world application to understand behavioral performance effects. In this article, we found that a purposefully engineered VR environment, which had been designed with an evidence-based selection of instruction principles, significantly improved the human performance compared to both a baseline training with textual instructions and a basic VR training. Our results indicate that perception engineering learning with VR is possible and offers substantial opportunities to improve learning outcomes.","[Bohne, Thomas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cyber Human Lab, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England; [Heine, Ina] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Lab Machine Tools & Prod Engn, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Gurerk, Ozgur] Univ Erfurt, Fac Law Social Sci & Econ, D-99089 Erfurt, Germany; [Rieger, Christoph] Tech Univ Dortmund, Inst Prod Syst, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Kemmer, Lukas] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Y.

In addition to conventional displays (dashboards) for the representation of abstract sensor values, we use the concept of Indexical Visualization, which can reduce the cognitive load for the viewer.

As a consequence of the rapidly expanding electrification of vehicles and transportation systems, the demand for wire harnesses can be expected to grow radically, further increasing assembly operator challenges. Thus, automating this assembly process is highly prioritised by production engineers. The rapid development of industrial robot technology has enabled more human-robot collaboration possibilities, simplifying the automation of wire harness process tasks. However, successful automation applications involving humans require efficient and safe allocation of tasks between humans and technology. Unfortunately, present assembly system design methods may be obsolete and insufficient in light of the capabilities of emerging automation technologies such as collaborative robots. This paper presents a design and specification methodology for human-centred manufacturing systems and focuses on collaborative assembly operations in complex production systems. A case study on human-robot collaboration provides an application example from a wire-harness collaborative assembly process. The proposed design methodology combines hierarchical task analysis with assessments of cognitive and physical Levels of Automation (LoAc and LoAp). The assessments are then followed by evaluations of the Levels of human-robot Collaboration (LoC) and the Levels of operator Skill requirements (LoSr) respectively. A task allocation matrix supports the identification of possible combinations of automation and collaboration solutions for a human-centred and collaborative wire harness assembly process. System designers and integrators may utilise the design and specification methodology to identify the potential and extent of humanrobot collaboration in collaborative manufacturing assembly operations.","[Salunkhe, Omkar; Stahre, Johan; Li, Dan; Johansson, Bjorn] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Mat Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Romero, David] Tecnol Monterrey, Dept Ind Engn & Mechatron, Mexico City, Mexico; [Li, Dan] Volvo Car Corp, Mfg Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; Tecnologico de Monterrey; Volvo,"Salunkhe, O (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Mat Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",omkar.salunkhe@chalmers.se,"Stahre, Johan/C-5357-2011; Romero, David/GQA-9701-2022; Li, Dan/B-1986-2016; Johansson, Bjorn/A-9920-2009","Romero, David/0000-0003-3610-0751; Li, Dan/0000-0003-1636-9745; Johansson, Bjorn/0000-0003-0488-9807","Chalmers University of Technology; Sten A Olsson foundation; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA; European Commission [952176, 824964]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [952176] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [824964] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme",Chalmers University of Technology; Sten A Olsson foundation; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA(Vinnova); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"The authors would like to thank the following organisations for supporting the work presented in this article by funding through different activities listed below,-The Chalmers University of Technology through Area of Advance Production.-Stenastiftelsen, Sten A Olsson foundation for research and culture.-Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA through research project EWASS - Empowering Human Workers for Assembly of Wire Harnesses.-European Commission, Network DIH-World, Grant no. 952176.-European Commission, Network DIH2, Grant no. 824964.",,43,8,8,12,25,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

With the significant improvement in the reliability and stability of facilities, human error has become one of the most critical factors for quality assurance. About 70% to 90% of quality defects in assembly production systems are directly or indirectly caused by human errors. In the last decades, the interest in using Augmented Reality (AR) in many application areas, including the industry, has increased. Although AR is recognized as an important technology, there is an evident gap in design guidelines and methodologies in this field. The objective of this paper is to find guidelines to help in designing AR-based manual assembly systems. We did a systematic literature mapping over scientific review papers, from 2015 to 2020, and found 14 review papers. From 14 papers, 11 of them (78,6%) presented guidelines topics. The guidelines found were classified into four groups: usability, cognitive, ergonomics, and corporate-related. The suggested group of general guidelines based on previous work may be useful as a starting point when designing AR-based manual assembly systems. We conclude that a comprehensive set, that encompasses general and specific guidelines, depends on the characteristics of the assembly line being implemented. Limitations of this work are the low number of review papers found and the probability of having new guideline categories not found in this paper.","[Agati, Salvador S.; Bauer, Rudieri D.; Paterno, Aleksander S.] Santa Catarina St Univ, Elect Engn Dept, Joinville, Brazil; [Hounsell, Marcelo da S.] Santa Catarina St Univ, Comp Sc Dept, Joinville, Brazil",,"Agati, SS (corresponding author), Santa Catarina St Univ, Elect Engn Dept, Joinville, Brazil.",salvador.agati@edu.udesc.br; rudieri.bauer@edu.udesc.br; marcelo.hounsell@udesc.br; aleksander.paterno@udesc.br,"PATERNO, ALEKSANDER/JMB-7030-2023; da Silva Hounsell, Marcelo/AAB-5430-2019",,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de N'ivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES-Brasil) [001]; Programa de Monitoria em Posgraduacao (PROMOP-UDESC); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient'ifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brasil); PIBITIs grant; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC-Brasil) [2019TR712],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de N'ivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES-Brasil); Programa de Monitoria em Posgraduacao (PROMOP-UDESC); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient'ifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brasil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); PIBITIs grant; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC-Brasil)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC)),"Authors would like to thank to Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de N ' ivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES-Brasil) - Codigo de Financiamento 001 - for the doctorates degree grant; to Programa de Monitoria em Posgraduacao (PROMOP-UDESC) for the masters degree grant; to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient ' ifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brasil) for the DT-II productivitys grant and PIBITIs grant, and; to Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC-Brasil) for partial fundings to LARVA (Laboratory for Research on Visual Applications) -T.O.

In the framework of Industry 5.0, humans are working alongside cobots to accomplish the required level of automation. However, human-robot interaction has brought up concerns regarding human factors (HF) and ergonomics. A human worker may experience cognitive stress as a result of cobots' irresponsive nature in unpredictably occurring situations, which adversely affects productivity. Therefore, there is a necessity to measure stress to enhance a human worker's performance in a human-robot collaborative environment. In this study, factory workers' mental workload was assessed using physiological, behavioural, and subjective measures. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were collected to acquire brain signals and track hemodynamic activity, respectively. The effect of task complexity, cobot movement speed, and cobot payload capacity on the mental stress of a human worker were observed for a task designed in the context of a smart factory. Task complexity and cobot speed proved to be more impactful. As physiological measures are unbiased and more authentic means to estimate stress, eventually they may replace the other conventional measures if they prove to correlate with the results of traditional ones. Here, regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were utilised to determine the correlation between physiological data and subjective and behavioural measures. Regression performed better for most of the targets and the best correlation (rsq-adj = 0.654146) was achieved for predicting missed beeps, a behavioural measure, using a combination of multiple EEG and fNIRS predictors. The k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm was used to evaluate the accuracy of correlation between traditional measures and physiological variables, with the highest accuracy of 77.8% achieved for missed beeps as the target. Results show that physiological measures can be more insightful and have the tendency to replace other biased parameters.","[Zakeri, Zohreh; Arif, Arshia; Omurtag, Ahmet; Breedon, Philip; Khalid, Azfar] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England",Nottingham Trent University,"Zakeri, Z (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England.",zohreh.zakeri@ntu.ac.uk; arshia.arif2021@my.ntu.ac.uk; ahmet.omurtag@ntu.ac.uk; philip.breedon@ntu.ac.uk; azfar.khalid@ntu.ac.uk,,"Khalid, Azfar/0000-0001-5270-6599; OMURTAG, AHMET/0000-0002-3773-8506","This research has received funding from Connected Everything (CE II) Feasibility Studies, Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC Award reference No. 4811539) and PepsiCo Europe.

This would be done by benefiting from knowledge and experience of humans, and balancing in a reactive way some complex or complicated tasks with intelligent systems. Several studies already dealt with such an objective, but few are done at a methodological level, which forbids, for example, the correct evaluation of design choices in terms of human awareness of the situation or mental workload when designing intelligent manufacturing systems integrating the human. Indeed, increasing the intelligence and autonomy of industrial systems and their composing entities (resources, products, robots horizontal ellipsis ), as fostered by Industry 4.0, increases their overall complexity. This modification reduces the ability to understand the behaviors of these systems, and leads to the difficulty for humans not only to elaborate alternative decisions when required, but also to make effective decisions and understand their consequences. This paper evaluates such a design methodology, the Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), and its applicability when designing an assistance system to support Human in the control of Intelligent Manufacturing System in Industry 4.0. Among several functions identified through the application of CWA, the assistant system might have to integrate a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. The evaluation of the methodology through the one of the designed assistant systems is done using a micro-world, which is an intelligent manufacturing cell composed of intelligent mobile ground robots, products, and static production robots interacting together and with a human supervisor in charge of the reaching of several time-based and energy-based performances indicators. The assistant system embeds a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. Twenty-three participants took part in experiments to evaluate the designed assistance system. First results show that the assistance system enables participants to have a correct awareness of the situation and a correct evaluation of their alternative decisions, while their mental workload is managed and expected production performances are reached. This paper contains an analysis of these experiments and points out some limits of the CWA method in the context of Industry 4.0, especially the lack of tool enabling to specify clearly the cooperation processes between the supervisor and the intelligent manufacturing system. This paper concludes with potential research avenues, the main one being the potential benefits of coupling CWA with human-machine cooperation principles to fine tune and adapt the cooperation between the human and the intelligent manufacturing system.","[Pacaux-Lemoine, Marie-Pierre; Berdal, Quentin; Trentesaux, Damien] UPHF, LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, F-59313 Valenciennes, France; [Guerin, Clement; Rauffet, Philippe; Chauvin, Christine] Univ South Brittany, CNRS UMR 6285, Lab STICC, F-56100 Lorient, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Polytechnique Hauts-de-France,"Pacaux-Lemoine, MP (corresponding author), UPHF, LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, F-59313 Valenciennes, France.",marie-pierre.lemoine@uphf.fr; quentin.berdal@uphf.fr; clement.guerin@univ-ubs.fr; philippe.rauffet@univ-ubs.fr; christine.chauvin@univ-ubs.fr; damien.trentesaux@uphf.fr,"Rauffet, Philippe/JRY-3261-2023; Chauvin, Christine/HDN-2711-2022; GUERIN, Clément/AAX-3405-2020","Pacaux-Lemoine, Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-7486-5723; Berdal, Quentin/0009-0004-0545-8624",ANR Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-17-CE10-0009]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE10-0009] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),ANR Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The research presented in this paper is carried out in the context of the HUMANISM No ANR-17-CE10-0009 research program, funded by the ANR Agence Nationale de la Recherche.

The challenges categorized in this paper can be used to identify opportunities for improvement in the operators' cognitive support in present factories as well as for researchers and developers of Operator 3.0 support solutions.","[Tarrar, Malin; Thorvald, Peter; Fast-Berglund, Asa] Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Thorvald, Peter] Univ Skovde, Skovde, Sweden; [Romero, David] Tecnol Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Skovde; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Tarrar, M (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden.",malin.tarrar@chalmers.se; peter.thorvald@his.se; fasth@chalmers.se; david.romero.diaz@gmail.com,"Romero, David/GQA-9701-2022; Fast-Berglund, Asa/D-4879-2015; Tarrar, Malin/E-1811-2016; Thorvald, Peter/C-3143-2012","Romero, David/0000-0003-3610-0751; Romero, David/0000-0002-1685-4305; Fast-Berglund, Asa/0000-0002-0524-7913; Tarrar, Malin/0000-0002-3120-8395; Thorvald, Peter/0000-0002-8369-5471",VINNOVA,VINNOVA(Vinnova),"The research presented was part of a VINNOVA funded projects, the Operator of the Future and Smart Digitalisation for Operators.

Moreover, the proposed system is able to assess the ergonomics in human-robot shared tasks and adapt the robot pose to improve ergonomics using a heuristics-based search algorithm.

This article examines the use of priming as a form of cognitive hacking to adversely affect quality inspection decisions in manufacturing, and investigates physiological measurements as means to detect such intrusion. In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection.","[Huang, Wenyan; Chen, Xiaoyu; Jin, Ran; Lau, Nathan] Virginia Tech, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lau, N (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",nathan.lau@vt.edu,"Lau, Nathan/T-1767-2019; Chen, Xiaoyu/AGX-8179-2022","Lau, Nathan/0000-0003-2235-9527; Huang, Wenyan/0000-0003-2914-1416","NSF [1839946]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1839946] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","We thank Mi Zhou, Tianzi Wang and Qing Lan for their support in the development of the logging system and preparation of the experiment.

However, the link between MF and industrial work performance has not been investigated, nor how this interacts with a passive lower back exoskeleton used during industrial work. Therefore, to elucidate its potential effect(s), this study investigated the accuracy of work performance and movement duration through a dual task paradigm and compared results between mentally fatigued volunteers and controls, with and without the exoskeleton. No main effects of MF and the exoskeleton were found. However, when mentally fatigued and wearing the exoskeleton, movement duration significantly increased compared to the baseline condition (beta MF:Exo=0.17, p=.02, omega 2=.03), suggesting an important interaction between the exoskeleton and one's psychobiological state. Importantly, presented data indicate a negative effect on production efficiency through increased performance time. Further research into the cognitive aspects of industrial work performance and human-exoskeleton interaction is therefore warranted.","[Govaerts, Renee; De Bock, Sander; El Makrini, Ilias; Habay, Jelle; Roelands, Bart; Vanderborght, Bram; Meeusen, Romain; De Pauw, Kevin] Vrije Univ Brussel, BruBot, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Govaerts, Renee; De Bock, Sander; Habay, Jelle; Van Cutsem, Jeroen; Roelands, Bart; Meeusen, Romain; De Pauw, Kevin] Vrije Univ Brussel, Human Physiol & Sports Physiotherapy Res Grp, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Stas, Lara] Vrije Univ Brussel, Biostat & Med Informat Res Grp, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Stas, Lara] Vrije Univ Brussel, Support Quantitat & Qualitat Res, Core Facil, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [El Makrini, Ilias] Vrije Univ Brussel & Flanders Make, Robot & Multibody Mech Res Grp, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Van Cutsem, Jeroen] Royal Mil Acad, LIFE Dept, Vital Signs & Performance Monitoring Res Unit, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Vanderborght, Bram] Vrije Univ Brussel, Robot & Multibody Mech Res Grp, IMEC, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"De Pauw, K (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Human Physiol & Sports Physiotherapy Res Grp, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",renee.jasmine.p.govaerts@vub.be; sander.de.bock@vub.be; Lara.Stas@vub.be; Ilias.El.Makrini@vub.be; Jelle.Habay@vub.be; Jeroen.vancutsem@mil.be; Bart.Roelands@vub.be; bram.vanderborght@vub.be; romain.meeusen@vub.be; Kevin.De.Pauw@vub.be,"De Bock, Sander/AAX-8336-2020; De Pauw, Kevin/E-8937-2018; Roelands, Bart/E-2337-2011; Van Cutsem, Jeroen/AAZ-6281-2021; Habay, Jelle/AAX-1511-2021; Stas, Lara/KHU-7472-2024; Vanderborght, Bram/A-1599-2008","Govaerts, Renee/0000-0003-0274-6204; El Makrini, Ilias/0000-0002-9980-517X; Vanderborght, Bram/0000-0003-4881-9341; De Bock, Sander/0000-0001-8351-9702; roelands, bart/0000-0002-2808-044X; De Pauw, Kevin/0000-0002-6901-7199; Habay, Jelle/0000-0001-9802-8367; Stas, Lara/0000-0003-1567-2881; Van Cutsem, Jeroen/0000-0001-6122-7629",European Union ?; Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme SOPHIA [871237],European Union ?(European Union (EU)); Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme SOPHIA,This work was supported by the European Union ?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme SOPHIA (Grant Agreement No. 871237) .,,49,7,7,4,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

The quality of the specification depends on the capability of the writer to formulate requirements aimed at different stakeholders: they are an expression of the customer's needs that are used by analysts, designers and testers. Given this central role of requirements as a mean to communicate intention, assuring their quality is essential to reduce misunderstandings that lead to potential waste. Problem: Quality assurance of requirement specifications is largely a manual effort that requires expertise and domain knowledge. However, this demanding cognitive process is also congested by trivial quality issues that should not occur in the first place. Principal ideas: We propose a taxonomy of requirements quality assurance complexity that characterizes cognitive load of verifying a quality aspect from the human perspective, and automation complexity and accuracy from the machine perspective.

The processes have also evolved from simple to complicated, and now complex systems, in the emerging context of Industry 4.0. This is notably the case with Intelligent Manufacturing Systems in which processes have become so autonomous that humans are unaware of the processes running, while they may need to intervene to update the manufacturing plan or modify the process configuration if a machine breaks down, or to assist process-intelligent entities when they find themselves in a deadlock. This paper highlights the lack of attention paid to the correct integration of humans in Intelligent Manufacturing Systems and provides solutions based on Human Machine Cooperation principles to retain humans in the process control loop with different levels of involvement identified by the levels of automation. The aim of these principles is to propose a human centered approach to design and evaluate systems, processes, and their interactions with humans. Herein, these principles are detailed and applied to Intelligent Manufacturing Systems using Artificial Self-Organizing systems (ASO) as an example. An assistance system was designed to support cooperation between ASO and human operators. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system and its utility in improving the performance of Human-Machine Systems, as well as its acceptability with regard to human factors.

In software development, the developers play a critical and fundamental role to accomplish each development activity, and the limitations induced by them are inevitable. Therefore, the ability to capture perceived code complexity accurately is very important for the software quality and its adequate maintenance. This Ph.D. thesis focuses on exploring the possible approaches to incorporating a human-centric dimension in software complexity assessment and management. To reach this purpose, we use the information captured from wearable and non-intrusive devices (e.g., ECG and Eye-tracking with Pupillography) to identify the relevant cognitive states (such as mental effort, stress and mental fatigue) of individual developers during the software development process, and use such data to develop new complexity metrics that consider the genuine human perception of the challenges in comprehending code. Expected new human-centric code complexity metrics must consider the developers' perspective and provide an accurate assessment of software complexity to improve the software's quality and reduce bugs, time consumed, and unnecessary costs.","[Hao, Gao] Macao Polytech Univ, Fac Sci Appl, Maocao, Peoples R China",Macao Polytechnic University,"Hao, G (corresponding author), Macao Polytech Univ, Fac Sci Appl, Maocao, Peoples R China.",p2109002@mpu.edu.mo,"Hao, Gao/LHA-2955-2024",,,,,,20,0,0,1,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,979-8-3503-1956-9,,,,2023,,,,,,,30,33,,10.1109/ISSREW60843.2023.00039,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW60843.2023.00039,,,4,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW0KT,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001096854800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This kind of industrial inspection robots is expected to automatically detect anomalous structures (e.g., defects, damages, rejects, etc.) from the images of the manufactured products. Generally, the existing visual anomaly detection (VAD) methods mainly focus on modeling the complex and high-dimensional distribution of normal data, while neglecting the specific visual properties of abnormal data since their frequency of occurrence is much less than that of the normal data. In this paper, inspired by the human cognition on extracting abstractly visual properties and to distinguish the anomaly patterns from the observed data, we propose a novel cognitive VAD method for industrial inspection robot. Specifically, we introduce a constrained latent space to mimic the cognitive ability of humans, where the abstraction learned from the observed normal and anomaly data are represented. We build our method based on a convolutional generative adversarial network and a denoising autoencoder, where the adversarial learning mechanism is adopted to establish the boundary between the normal and anomaly data. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real-world dataset where the images are captured for the manufactured products. The comprehensive results comparing with several recent VAD methods show that the proposed method is effective to detect the anomaly images of different categories with a high accuracy.

Human-robot interfaces that help strengthen an operators situational awareness without inducing excessive cognitive load are crucial to the success of teleoperation. This paper presents a novel visual interface that allows operators to simultaneously control a 6-DoF camera platform and a robotic manipulator whilst experiencing the remote environment through a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD). The proposed system, Orbital Head-Mounted Display (OHMD), utilizes head rotation tracking to command camera movement in azimuth and elevation directions around a fixation point located at a robot's end-effector. A human factor study was conducted to compare the interface acceptance, perceived workload, and task performance of OHMD with a conventional interface utilizing multiple fixed cameras (Array) and a standard head-mounted display implementation (HMD). Results show that both the OHMD and HMD interfaces significantly improve task performance, reduce perceived workload and increase interface acceptance compared to the Array interface. Participants reported they preferred OHMD due to the increased assistance and freedom in viewpoint selection. Whilst OHMD excelled in usefulness, the standard HMD interface allowed operators to perform robotic welding tasks significantly faster.","[Kuitert, Sjoerd; Abbink, David A.; Peternel, Luka] Delft Univ Technol, Cognit Robot, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands; [Kuitert, Sjoerd; Hofland, Jelle; Heemskerk, Cock J.

Human factor engineering traditionally uses a percentile-approach to work-design, preventing an exact adjustment to the ergonomic needs of particular users. New technological advances provide opportunities for major improvements; novel assistance and information systems allow the accommodation of the needs of an increasingly diverse assembly workforce, while minimizing overall physical and mental stress. Based on a recently developed synopsis of options for individualization of assembly workstations, an example of an application in field assembly is being presented and illustrated by a full-scale demonstrator for the assembly of large scale composite parts for the aerospace industry.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of different instruction methods (i.e., HoloLens AR-based and paper-based instructions) and task complexity (low and high-demanding tasks) on cognitive workloads and performance. Twenty-eight healthy males with a mean age of 32.12 (SD 2.45) years were recruited in this study and were randomly divided into two groups. The first group performed the experiment using AR-based instruction, and the second group used paper-based instruction. Performance was measured using total task time (TTT). The cognitive workload was measured using the power of electroencephalograph (EEG) features and the NASA task load index (NASA TLX). The results showed that using AR instructions resulted in a reduction in maintenance times and an increase in mental workload compared to paper instructions, particularly for the more demanding tasks. With AR instruction, 0.45% and 14.94% less time was spent on low- and high-demand tasks, respectively, as compared to paper instructions. According to the EEG features, employing AR to guide employees during highly demanding maintenance tasks increased information processing, which could be linked with an increased germane cognitive load. Increased germane cognitive load means participants can better facilitate long-term knowledge and skill acquisition. These results suggested that AR is superior and recommended for highly demanding maintenance tasks since it speeds up maintenance times and increases the possibility that information is stored in long-term memory and encrypted for recalls.","[Alessa, Faisal M.; Alhaag, Mohammed H.; Al-harkan, Ibrahim M.; Ramadan, Mohamed Z.; Alqahtani, Fahad M.] King Saud Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, POB 800, Riyadh 11421, Saudi Arabia",King Saud University,"Alessa, FM (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn, POB 800, Riyadh 11421, Saudi Arabia.",fmalessa@ksu.edu.sa,"Alhaag, Mohammed/AAX-4356-2021; Alessa, Faisal/GRE-8256-2022; Alqahtani, Fahad M./ISH-8566-2023; Ramadan, Mohamed/A-8568-2017","Ramadan, Mohamed/0000-0003-2135-197X; Alqahtani, Fahad M./0000-0002-1431-7290; Alhaag, Mohammed H/0000-0002-0128-1372; Alharkan, Ibrahim/0000-0003-3942-4559; Alessa, Faisal/0000-0002-9561-064X","The authors appreciate the support from Researchers Supporting Project number (RSPD2023R814), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Human workers, due to their unique blend of cognitive and motor skills, thus flexibility, are indispensable and will continue to play a pivotal role. Because of their unique experiences and attributes, they inherently exhibit variability in their processing times and learning rates, which complicates frequent production ramp-ups. Recognizing the lack of comprehensive models that simultaneously account for stochastic processing times and heterogeneous learning during production ramp-ups, this study aims to bridge this gap. We developed an analytical model of a two-worker production system with an intermediate buffer by focusing on worker learning curves, stochastic processing times, and learning heterogeneity. Through an illustrative case, we derived insights into the performance of such systems, specifically in terms of measures including the mean throughput time of a batch, mean waiting time of a part in the buffer, mean idle time of workers, workin-progress distribution, and buffer usage during the production run. We found that deterministic learning models can significantly underestimate the throughput times, and even consistent average learning rates can lead to variable throughput times based on the learning patterns. Our findings emphasize the need for production managers to consider these factors for realistic and effective production planning, underscoring the novelty of our approach in addressing these intricate dynamics to improve not only system performance, but also worker well-being.","[Ranasinghe, Thilini; Grosse, Eric H.] Saarland Univ, Fac Human & Business Sci, Chair Digital Transformat Operat Management, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Senanayake, Chanaka D.] Univ Peradeniya, Fac Engn, Dept Mfg & Ind Engn, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; [Ranasinghe, Thilini] Saarland Univ, Fac Human & Business Sci, Chair Digital Transformat Operat Management, Campus C3 1, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany",Saarland University; University of Peradeniya; Saarland University,"Ranasinghe, T (corresponding author), Saarland Univ, Fac Human & Business Sci, Chair Digital Transformat Operat Management, Campus C3 1, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.",thilini.ranasinghe@uni-saarland.de,"Senanayake, Chanaka/KBB-9369-2024; Grosse, Eric/AAG-2538-2019","Grosse, Eric/0000-0001-6299-1282; Ranasinghe, Thilini/0000-0003-4528-8290",,,,,66,2,2,2,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-5273,1873-7579,,INT J PROD ECON,Int.

However, human workers need to finish tasks that require high cognitive abilities, which increases the risk of mental fatigue. Fatigue can negatively impact workers and even threaten the safety of workers. Currently, the dynamics of human fatigue model are rarely considered. Hence, it is crucial to develop a dynamic allocation method for human-robot collaborative tasks that considers dynamic human fatigue to ensure efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. This paper proposes a task reallocation method for human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model. A fatigue feature extraction method from multimodal data and a fatigue evaluation network are proposed to evaluate the current fatigue status of human workers. Based on the evaluation results, the human fatigue model is dynamically updated. If the worker's fatigue state changes, a task reallocation scheme is generated by an improved genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning and the dynamic human fatigue model. The experimental results show that the proposed model and algorithm are effective and efficient, and can provide innovative insights for realizing a human-centered manufacturing workshop.","[Yao, Bitao] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinyu] China Ship Dev & Design Ctr, Wuhan 430064, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinyu; Ji, Zhenrui; Xu, Wenjun] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Informat Engn, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Kun] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Informat Engn, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China; [Yao, Bitao; Ji, Zhenrui; Xu, Wenjun] Wuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Broadband Wireless Commun & Sensor N, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Kun] Hubei Univ Econ, Hubei Internet Finance Informat Engn Technol Res C, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology; Hubei University of Economics; Wuhan University of Technology; Hubei University of Economics,"Xiao, K (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Informat Engn, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China.",xiaokun@hbue.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52005376]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2021CFA077]; DITDP [JCKY2021603B006]; Young Topnotch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); DITDP; Young Topnotch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province,"This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52005376) , Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2021CFA077) , DITDP (Grant No. JCKY2021603B006) , and the Young Topnotch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province.",,45,3,3,40,47,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

An exploratory case study involving an aerospace assembly line was conducted to gain insights into the model developed. The findings of the case study revealed four different causes of human errors, as follows: (i) description similarity error, (ii) capture errors, (iii) memory lapse errors, and (iv) interruptions. Based on this analysis, error-proofing measures have been proposed accordingly.

To facilitate an intelligent AR-aided assembly, this paper proposed an edge computing (EC)-driven Scene-aware Intelligent AR Assembly (EC-SIARA) system, which can understand the assembly status on the fly with the lightweight wearable AR glass, and thus, worker-centered assistance is available to provide intuitive visual guidance accordingly. In beginning, the connection between the wearable AR glasses and EC system is established, which can alleviate the computing burden for the resource-constraint wearable AR glasses, and a high-efficiency scene awareness module during the manual assembly process is achieved. And then, based on context understanding of the current assembly status, the intuitive instructions can be triggered automatically, avoiding the operator's cognitive load to launch the next AR instruction strictly. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed EC-SIARA system, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can realize a worker-center AR assembly process, improve the assembly efficiency, and reduce the occurrence of assembly errors effectively.","[Fu, Mingyu; Fang, Wei; Gao, Shan; Hong, Jianhao; Chen, Yizhou] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Modern Post, Sch Automat, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Fang, W (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Modern Post, Sch Automat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fangwei@bupt.edu.cn,"fu, mingyu/KHW-8636-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52105505]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [3204050]; Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology [VRLAB2020B05],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology,"This work is partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52105505), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (3204050), the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems (VRLAB2020B05).",,41,10,11,7,65,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

In this paper, we close this gap by comparing tactile, auditory, and visual error feedback in a user study with 16 cognitively impaired workers.

Agreement, e.g., on a special product, has an affective influence on its manufacturing process. However, most of the existing opinion dynamics models are linear time invariant. In this article, eight non-linear time variant models for opinion dynamics are proposed and put to test on subjective synthetic networks. Despite all the efforts, the issues of stability and convergence in time-varying networks, which can be found in industrial contexts, have not been resolved yet and only sufficient conditions have been derived. In the proposed models, unlike in the classical ones such as the French-DeGroot model, we have taken into account each member's susceptibility to persuasion by others that is a cognitive parametric function of individuals' opinions. In addition, we have introduced a stubbornness matrix which has large values initially but shrinks to zero as the time grows. This implies that agents' susceptibilities to others, at the beginning of any experiment, are smaller than what they are at the end. We present a novel mathematical formulation for these new opinion dynamics models and prove their stability too. For evaluation, we simulated a scenario in which some people connected via a graph, voted for a product. They initially had their own stands but gradually came to a point found through interaction with the others. The results confirm the convergence and stability of the proposed models.","[Nematollahzadeh, Seyed Mahmood; Ozgoli, Sadjaad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept ECE, Tehran 1411713116, Iran; [Nematollahzadeh, Seyed Mahmood] Iran Telecom Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Jolfaei, Alireza] Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Haghighi, Mohammad Sayad] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 131451384, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University; Macquarie University; University of Tehran,"Haghighi, MS (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 131451384, Iran.",s.nematollahzadeh@modares.ac.ir; ozgoli@modares.ac.ir; alireza.jolfaei@mq.edu.au; sayad@ut.ac.ir,"Jolfaei, Alireza/GQH-6907-2022; Haghighi, Mohammad/G-2290-2014","Jolfaei, Alireza/0000-0001-7818-459X; Sayad Haghighi, Mohammad/0000-0003-1042-837X",,,,,29,4,4,0,24,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1551-3203,1941-0050,,IEEE T IND INFORM,IEEE Trans.

To reflect the dependency between PSFs, the system dynamics based modeling approach is adopted to identify the interactions between PSFs and the overall risk boundary. It helps to establish a dynamic model for human reliability assessment and human-machine interface design. Although this paper is focused on the method application on nuclear field, it has the potential to be extended to other industrial sectors.","[Wu, Guanyin; Jia, Ming] China Nucl Power Engn Co Ltd, State Key Lab Nucl Power Safety Monitoring Techno, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yi; Wang, Zhen; Peng, Caifang; Lu, Yanyu; Fu, Shan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Dept Automat, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",China Nuclear Power Engineering Co Ltd.; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Lu, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Dept Automat, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",luyi1@sjtu.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of China [61803263]; Startup Fund for Youngman Research at SJTU of China (SFYR at SJTU),National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Startup Fund for Youngman Research at SJTU of China (SFYR at SJTU),This research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 61803263) and the Startup Fund for Youngman Research at SJTU of China (SFYR at SJTU).,,18,0,0,2,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2945-9133,1611-3349,978-3-030-49182-6; 978-3-030-49183-3,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2020,12187,,,,,,79,89,,10.1007/978-3-030-49183-3_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49183-3_7,,,11,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Ergonomics; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Engineering; Psychology,BX3ZG,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001286441200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper investigates humans' behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners' evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multicriteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human-machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems.","[Zigart, Tanja; Zafari, Setareh; Stuerzl, Felix; Schlund, Sebastian] TU Wien, Inst Management Sci, Theresianumgasse 27, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Kiesewetter, Robert; Kasparick, Hans -Peter] Siemens AG, Werk Kombinationstech Chemnitz WKC, D-09116 Chemnitz, Germany",Technische Universitat Wien; Siemens AG; Siemens AG; Siemens Germany,"Zigart, T (corresponding author), TU Wien, Inst Management Sci, Theresianumgasse 27, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",tanja.zigart@tuwien.ac.at,"Schlund, Sebastian/JAC-8459-2023","Zafari, Setareh/0000-0003-4940-1764","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); TU Wien through the endowed professorship HCCPPAS [FFG-852789]","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); TU Wien through the endowed professorship HCCPPAS","Special thanks are directed to all the participants at Siemens WKC and in the TU Wien pilot factory for being part of the study and for their constructive cooperation.

In this context, cognitive assistance systems are seen as a means to support human information processing and decision-making. However, the understanding of cognitive processes and actual needs is still somewhat vague. What is needed is a deeper understanding of the nature and scope of needs, to properly identify cases for assistance and select and design appropriate tools. Building on the concept of constraints as applied in Cognitive Work Analysis, we elaborate on this perspective by firstly proposing a general model of human cognition centered around the concept of constraints. A series of qualitative interviews with employees in various sectors is then conducted to test the approach. The results demonstrate that a participative method focusing on needs for assistance can yield relevant results. Based upon the experiences from the study, a taxonomy of assistance for cognitive work is finally proposed. This taxonomy can be embedded in facilitated workshops in order to satisfy identified needs. (C) 2022 The Authors.

In such regard, the advent of the 4th industrial revolution (Agriculture 4.0) based on digitalization, is an unprecedented opportunity of rethinking the role of innovation in a new human-centric perspective. In particular, the establishment of an interconnected work environment and the augmentation of the operator's physical, sensorial, and cognitive capabilities, are two technologies which can be effectively employed for substantially improving the ergonomics and safety conditions on the workplace. This paper approaches such topic referring to the vibration risk, which is a well-known cause of work-related pathologies, and proposes an original methodology for mapping the risk exposure of the operators to the activities performed. A miniaturized wearable device is employed to collect vibration data, and the signals obtained are segmented in time windows and processed in order to extract the significant features. Finally, a machine learning classifier has been developed to recognize the worker's activity and to evaluate the related exposure to vibration risks. To validate the methodology proposed, an experimental analysis in real operating conditions has been finally carried out by monitoring the activities performed by a team of workers during harvesting operations. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the methodology proposed.","[Aiello, Giuseppe] Univ Palermo, Dept Engn, Viale Sci Ed 8, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Catania, Pietro; Vallone, Mariangela] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr & Forest Sci, Viale Sci Ed 8, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Venticinque, Mario] Natl Council Res, Ist & Sistemi Agr & Forestali Mediterraneo ISAFoM, Via Empedocle 58, I-95128 Catania, Italy",University of Palermo; University of Palermo; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per i Sistemi Agricoli e Forestali del Mediterraneo (ISAFoM-CNR),"Aiello, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Engn, Viale Sci Ed 8, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",giuseppe.aiello03@unipa.it; pietro.catania@unipa.it; mariangela.vallone@unipa.it; mario.venticinque@cnr.it,"Catania, Pietro/ABA-9990-2021; Aiello, Giuseppe/AGN-1003-2022",", mario venticinque/0009-0006-6171-1916",,,,,30,9,9,2,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of data island with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections.

Currently, monitoring systems are used for independent assessment of human factors. However, the rise of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) has provided the framework for synchronizing multiple operator well-being assessments to create a comprehensive understanding of the operator's performance and health. Within manufacturing, an operator's dynamic well-being can be attributed to their physical and cognitive fatigue across the assembly process. As such, we apply non-invasive video understanding techniques to extract relevant assembly process information for automatic physical fatigue assessment. Our novelty involves a video-based fatigue estimation method, in which the boundary-aware dual-stream MS-TCN combined with an LSTM is proposed to detect the operation type, operation repetitions, and the target arm performing each task in an assembly process video. The detected results are then input into our physical fatigue profile to automatically assess the operator's localized physical fatigue impact. The assembly process of a real-world bookshelf is recorded and tested against, with our algorithm results showing superiority in operation segmentation and target arm detection as opposed to other recent action segmentation models. In addition, we integrate a cognitive fatigue assessment tool that captures operator physiological signals in real-time for body response detection caused by stress.

Evidently, their role will change from physical to rather cognitive tasks, such as decision-making or control and monitoring of processes. A suitable medium that can support employees in interpreting the data generated are machine learning (ML) applications. Nevertheless, recent studies show that the knowledge required to implement an ML solution is not available in a large number of companies. In order to close the knowledge gap and subsequently prepare human operators for the implementation and use of ML applications, it is highly relevant to provide proper assistance. For this reason, the present publication aims to develop a cognitive assistance system that supports shop floor managers in implementing ML use cases in manufacturing (referred to as CAS-ML). The CAS-ML concretizes a previously published procedure model with additional steps as well as learning material and is realized as a software thereupon. Finally, the CAS-ML is evaluated by operative employees and tested on an open-source data set.","[Rosemeyer, Jannik; Beck, Laurenz; Metternich, Joachim] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Prod Management Technol & Machine Tool, Otto Berndt Str 2, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany",,"Rosemeyer, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Prod Management Technol & Machine Tool, Otto Berndt Str 2, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,0,Inst Production and Logistics Research GbR Herberger & Hubner,Offenburg,"Senator-Burda-Strasse 31a, Offenburg, GERMANY",2701-6277,,,Con Prod Sys Logisti,,,2023,,,,,,,342,352,,10.15488/13453,http://dx.doi.org/10.15488/13453,,,11,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BX5VD,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001304065500034,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated attention related modalities of P300 ERP component and engagement index (EI), which is extracted from signal power ratios of alpha, beta and frequency bands. Simultaneously, we quantified the task unrelated movements, which are previously reported to be related to attention level, in an automated way employing kinect TM sensor. Reaction times were also recorded and investigated. We found that during the monotonous task, both the P300 amplitude and EI decreased as the time of the task progressed. On the other hand, the increase of the task unrelated movement quantity was observed, together with the increase in RTs. These findings lead to conclusion that the monotonous assembly work induces the decrease of attention and engagement of the workers as the task progresses, which is observable in both neural (EEG) and behavioral (RT and unrelated movements) signal modalities. Apart from observing how the attention-related modalities are changing over time, we investigated the functional relationship between the neural and behavioral modalities by using Pearson's correlation. Since the Person's correlation coefficients showed the functional relationship between the attention-related modalities, we proposed the creation of the multimodal implicit Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system, which could acquire and process neural and behavioral data in real-time, with the aim of creating the system that could be aware of the operator's mental states during the industrial work, consequently improving the operator's well-being.","[Mijovic, Pavle; Gligorijevic, Ivan; Mijovic, Bogdan] MBrainTrain LCC, Belgrade, Serbia; [Milovanovic, Milos] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, IT Dept, Belgrade, Serbia; [Kovic, Vanja] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philosophy, Dept Psychol, Belgrade, Serbia; [Zivanovic-Macuzic, Ivana] Univ Kragujevac, Dept Anat & Forens Med, Fac Med Sci, Kragujevac, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade; University of Kragujevac,"Mijovic, B (corresponding author), MBrainTrain LCC, Belgrade, Serbia.",pavle.mijovic@mbraintrain.com; milos.milovanovic@mmklab.org; ivan@mbraintrain.com; vanja.kovic@f.bg.ac.rs; ivanaanatom@yahoo.com; bogdan@mbraintrain.com,"Kovic, Vanja/K-4937-2019; Kovic, Vanja/O-9504-2016","Kovic, Vanja/0000-0002-3954-1125",EU - FP7 Marie Curie Actions FP7-PEOPLE-2011-ITN,EU - FP7 Marie Curie Actions FP7-PEOPLE-2011-ITN,This research is financed under EU - FP7 Marie Curie Actions FP7-PEOPLE-2011-ITN.,,24,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-58628-1; 978-3-319-58627-4,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2017,10284,,I,,,,66,78,,10.1007/978-3-319-58628-1_6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58628-1_6,,,13,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BL3FL,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000449655200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Healthcare 4.0; Industry 4.0; Simulation-based training; Design optimization; Human Factors; Ergonomics,PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; TOOLS,"Among the main features of Industry 4.0, digitization and the evolution of the human-machine interaction occupy a central role. These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0.The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners' perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers' performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training.","[Brunzini, Agnese] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Via Brecce Bianche 12, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [Peruzzini, Margherita] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Engn Enzo Ferrari, Via Vivarelli 10, I-41125 Modena, Italy; [Barbadoro, Pamela] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Biomed Sci & Publ Hlth, Sect Hyg Prevent Med & Publ Hlth, Via Tronto 10-a, I-60126 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Marche Polytechnic University,"Brunzini, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Via Brecce Bianche 12, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",a.brunzini@staff.univpm.it,"Peruzzini, Margherita/K-8165-2013; barbadoro, pamela/AAC-5041-2022","BARBADORO, Pamela/0000-0003-1495-0165; Brunzini, Agnese/0000-0003-0450-2510",,,,,48,1,1,4,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2467-964X,2452-414X,,J IND INF INTEGR,J.

A mixed-method approach comprising quantitative observations and qualitative interviews was employed to evaluate the system's usability and performance with different human-CPS interaction modalities. The findings reveal variable levels of usability and performance across different human-CPS interaction modalities. Users expressed a preference for the three-dimensional immersive environment compared to a two-dimensional setting due to a better sense of presence. However, they experienced heightened cognitive load when utilizing novel interaction methods such as hand gestures and voice commands. Interestingly, despite this increased cognitive demand, users exhibited comparable performance in the assigned task, irrespective of their familiarity with the interaction modality. The results underscore the importance of human-centered design in CPS development.

The question of task allocation arises in the organization of these human-robot interactions. State of the art shows static, compensatory task allocation approaches in current assembly systems and flexible, adaptive task sharing (ATS) approaches in human factors research. The latter should exploit the economic and ergonomic advantages of cobot usage. Previous research results did not provide a clear insight into whether industrial workers prefer static or adaptive task allocation and which tasks workers do prefer to assign to cobots. Therefore, we set up a cobot demonstrator with a realistic industrial assembly use case and did a user study with experienced workers from the shop floor (n = 25). The aim of the user study is to provide a systematic understanding and evaluation of workers' preferences in a practical context of human-robot interaction (HRI) in assembly. Our main findings are that participants preferred the ATS concept to a predetermined task allocation and reported increased satisfaction with the allocation. Results show that participants are more likely to give manual tasks to the cobot in contrast to cognitive tasks. It shows that workers do not entrust all tasks to robots, but like to take over cognitive tasks by themselves.

In particular, workstations where human operators may get injured because of repetitive tasks, bad postures or heavy loads are targeted. The introduction of such interactive systems on industrial workstations brings new challenges concerning human cognitive and physical considerations to factories. We followed an approach involving operators, and ergonomics and cognitive engineering skills to improve the introduction of interactive robots in the industry. In this paper, we present the first application of our work on a pyrotechnic tank cleaning workstation. Our approach is illustrated with the design of a solution through several simulation steps involving the workstation's operators.

However, the real collaboration can be sporadic, especially in the case of assembly tasks, whichmight involve autonomous operations to be executed by either the robot or the human worker. In this scenario, it might be beneficial to predict the actions of the human in order to control the robot both safely and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to predict human activity patterns in order to early infer when a specific collaborative operation will be requested by the human and to allow the robot to perform alternative autonomous tasks in the mean-while.

To avoid undesirable side effects, and to exploit the full performance potential of experts, it is crucial to consider the human perspective when developing new technologies. Specifically, human sub-tasks during machine operation must be described to gain insights into cognitive processes. This research proposes a cognition-based framework by integrating a number of known psychological concepts. The focus is on the description of cognitive (team) processes in the resolution of anomalies within a manufacturing process with interdisciplinary experts working together. An observational eye tracking study with retrospective think-aloud interviews (N = 3) provides empirical evidence for all cognitive processes proposed in the framework, such as regular process monitoring and-in case of a detected anomaly-diagnosis, problem solving, and resolution. Moreover, the role of situation awareness, individual expertise and (cognitive) team processes is analyzed and described. Further, implications regarding a human-centered development of future production systems are discussed.

Advances in various fields enabled the recent development of smaller, wearable, and wireless eye-tracking devices which are suitable for naturalistically studying manufacturing processes, such as human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, the implementation of eye-tracking for evaluating mental workload in HRC is still limited, especially in long-duration sessions. This paper provides an overview on the application of eye-tracking technology in the context of cognitive ergonomics within the manufacturing sector, with special attention to eye-tracking metrics and their interpretation relatively to human state in long-duration sessions (i.e., work shifts). In addition, an example case study will be presented to explore the reliability of the most common eye-tracking metrics, concerning a repetitive assembly process of 8 h in an HRC setting. Among the explored eye-tracking metrics, pupil dilation, number and average duration of fixations, and number saccades provided useful insights on the mental strain in dynamic conditions. In addition, from the multiple information gathered by eye-tracking, different phenomena related to mental workload were able to be distinguished. The use of cognitive resources resulting from learning process was well detected by pupil dilation, number of fixations and saccades. Mental fatigue, on the other hand, was well detected by the average duration of fixations and the pupil diameter. These results highlight the need to consider multiple eye-tracking metrics simultaneously to obtain a holistic view of the operator's psychophysiological state.","[Gervasi, Riccardo; Capponi, Matteo; Mastrogiacomo, Luca; Franceschini, Fiorenzo] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn DIGEP, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Franceschini, F (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn DIGEP, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",riccardo.gervasi@polito.it; matteo.capponi@polito.it; luca.mastrogiacomo@polito.it; fiorenzo.franceschini@polito.it,"Gervasi, Riccardo/KHE-3109-2024; Franceschini, Fiorenzo/C-2583-2013","CAPPONI, MATTEO/0000-0002-4669-2140; Mastrogiacomo, Luca/0000-0002-8454-5918; Gervasi, Riccardo/0000-0002-3006-3382",Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca - within the PRIN 2022 program [104],Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca - within the PRIN 2022 program,"This study was carried out within the << Empathically enhanced robot for the collaboration with HUmans in MANufacturing (E.HU.MAN)>> project - funded by the Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca - within the PRIN 2022 program (D.D.104 - 02/02/2022).

The question that motivates this study is: 'is it possible to train industrial workers for what exactly is coming instead of preparing them for a large set of scenarios - even very unlikely ones?'. This work proposes: (i) a structured On-the-Job Training strategy for non-routine tasks, called 'training-on-the-go' or 'prescriptive training', according to which a Prescriptive Analytics module schedules the training sessions not long before the actual performance, but only when and if needed; (ii) a proof-of-concept of a game-based training system where virtual scenes and context of an industrial site are faithfully recreated thanks to digital twin data and models; (iii) the use of evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive maps (E-FCM) for the extraction of the workers' implicit procedural knowledge and for the comparison of mental models of experienced vs. inexperienced workers to assess potential misconceptions or flaws in their decision-making process. This work contributes to the evolution of worker training paradigms and systems from the perspective of human-centric cyber-physical production systems and aims for current gaps in workforce training, i.e. poor timeliness and effectiveness, limited context and industrial information integration, and scarce focus on the experts' implicit knowledge. An application study with a non-routine task on an offshore oil platform demonstrates how the proposed system facilitates knowledge transfer, offers situational awareness and sustains the workforce competence development process.","[Longo, Francesco; Padovano, Antonio; Elbasheer, Mohaiad] Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [De Felice, Fabio; Petrillo, Antonella] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Engn, Naples, Italy; [Longo, Francesco] Univ Calabria, Cube 45C,Third Floor, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria; Parthenope University Naples; University of Calabria,"Longo, F (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Cube 45C,Third Floor, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",f.longo@unical.it,"Longo, Francesco/C-1182-2013; Padovano, Antonio/AAR-6467-2020","Padovano, Antonio/0000-0001-6374-1816; Elbasheer, Mohaiad Osman/0000-0002-4922-4529","Italian Ministry of Educa-tion, Universities and Research MIUR [PRIN - 2017FW8BB4]","Italian Ministry of Educa-tion, Universities and Research MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Acknowledgements Part of this research work has been carried out in the context of project SO4SIMS (Smart Operators 4.0 based on Simulation for Industry and Manufacturing Systems) funded by the Italian Ministry of Educa-tion, Universities and Research MIUR (Project PRIN - 2017FW8BB4) .",,74,15,15,5,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2467-964X,2452-414X,,J IND INF INTEGR,J.

A year later, in Study 2 (n = 176), we confirmed the factor structure through a confirmatory factor analysis and we conducted a latent growth curve analysis to examine potential changes of the previous skill requirements due to the lockdown and the forced remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings showed that cognitive, functional business, strategic and managing people skills are considered as important resources for the industry 4.0, being the functional business skills increasingly relevant in time 2.

The metrics are meant to yield detailed insights on the information perception of workers and the resulting work activities. Besides the discovery of needs for reconfiguration of worker assistance systems and assembly stations, the metrics can also be used as a basis for comparison to quantify differences between multiple setups. This paper investigates metrics for the assessment of human-centered assembly station design and worker assistance systems. Therefore, multiple categories of metrics on human-technology-interaction are derived from literature and contextualized for worker assistance systems. For validation, selected metrics are implemented at an industrial-grade assembly station for an electric motor replica in a learning factory. The findings in the validation allow the assessment of the information perception and the work activities regarding material picking, handling and ergonomics.","[Hock, Fabian; Metternich, Joachim] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Prod Management Technol & Machine Tools PTW, Otto Berndt Str 2, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Hock, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Prod Management Technol & Machine Tools PTW, Otto Berndt Str 2, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",,,,Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research,Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research,The research leading to these results was conducted as part of the project Fertigung und Logistik im organisationalen Wandel -menschzentriert und IT-unterstutzt (FLoW-mIT) and has received funding from Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research.,,26,0,0,1,1,Inst Production and Logistics Research GbR Herberger & Hubner,Offenburg,"Senator-Burda-Strasse 31a, Offenburg, GERMANY",2701-6277,,,Con Prod Sys Logisti,,,2024,,,,,,,687,696,,10.15488/17757,http://dx.doi.org/10.15488/17757,,,10,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BX5NI,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001300594300061,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition to the traditional stressors such as workload or strict deadlines, the constant demand for interaction with robots and machines and the poorly designed and unclear interfaces lead to additional cognitive stress for workers. In this poster, we outline a system based on wearable sensors that can collect and store data relevant to the assessment of workers' stress. The sensors measure physiological indicators such as heart rate or respiratory rate, as well as geospatial data that includes GPS coordinates and workers' movement, speed and acceleration. The data generated by the sensors is transmitted to the lightweight on-board unit on the back of the fabrics (T-shirt or bra) and then streamed to the processing unit (Raspberry Pi) via BLE.

It causes an unsafe and unpleasant working environment that directly impacts the quality of the product, workers' productivity, and effectiveness. This study aimed to give a specialized solution for tests and explore possible solutions to the given problem in neuroergonomics and human-robot interaction. The designed modular and adaptive laboratory model of the industrial assembly workstation represents the laboratory infrastructure for conducting advanced research in the field of ergonomics, neuroergonomics, and human-robot interaction. It meets the operator's anatomical, anthropometric, physiological, and biomechanical characteristics. Comparing standard, ergonomic, guided, and collaborative work will be possible based on workstation construction and integrated elements. These possibilities allow the industry to try, analyze, and get answers for an identified problem, the condition, habits, and behavior of operators in the workplace. The set-up includes a workstation with an industry work chair, a Poka-Yoke system, adequate lighting, an audio 5.0 system, containers with parts and tools, EEG devices (a cap and smartfones), an EMG device, touchscreen PC screen, and collaborative robot. The first phase of the neuroergonomic study was performed according to the most common industry tasks defined as manual, monotonous, and repetitive activities. Participants have a task to assemble the developed prototype model of an industrial product using prepared parts and elements, and instructed by the installed touchscreen PC. In the beginning, the participant gets all the necessary information about the experiment and gets 15 min of practice. After the introductory part, the EEG device is mounted and prepared for recording. The experiment starts with relaxing music for 5 min. The whole experiment lasts two sessions per 60 min each, with a 15 min break between the sessions. Based on the first experiments, it is possible to develop, construct, and conduct complex experiments for industrial purposes to improve the physical, cognitive, and organizational aspects and increase workers' productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It has highlighted the possibility of applying modular and adaptive ergonomic research laboratory experimental set-up to transform standard workplaces into the workplaces of the future.","[Savkovic, Marija; Caiazzo, Carlo; Djapan, Marko; Vukicevic, Arso M.; Macuzic, Ivan] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Engn, Kragujevac, Serbia; [Pusica, Milos] mBrainTrain Doo, Belgrade, Serbia; [Pusica, Milos] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Food Sci & Environm Hlth, Dublin, Ireland",University of Kragujevac,"Djapan, M (corresponding author), Univ Kragujevac, Fac Engn, Kragujevac, Serbia.",djapan@kg.ac.rs,"Vukicevic, Arso/AGQ-6095-2022; Macuzic, Ivan/GXZ-6435-2022; Djapan, Marko/AFY-1607-2022; Pušica, Miloš/JZE-1252-2024","Vukicevic, Arso/0000-0003-4886-373X; Pusica, Milos/0009-0003-4522-6222; Savkovic, Marija/0000-0002-3620-7762; Djapan, Marko/0000-0002-8016-8422",Innovation Fund Republic of Serbia [50231]; European Commission [955901]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [955901] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),Innovation Fund Republic of Serbia; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"This study was partially funded by the Innovation Fund Republic of Serbia, StayAlert-A New Tool for Safe Work (Project ID: 50231).

In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making.

The digitalization trends and initiatives such as Industry 4.0 show the manufacturing industry the advantages to incorporate new methods and tools into their businesses. Even though manufacturing IT systems are designed to be adaptive to product and volume changes, they are still widely characterized by their rigid structures. Making large changes to manufacturing IT systems with comprehensive structures is complex and requires large amounts of resources. Therefore, it is important for the manufacturing companies to make the correct investments.

However, the lack of real-time information sharing during HMWS implementation and operation, coupled with uncertainties stemming from human instability and the complexities introduced by smart networking environments in the context of I4.0, poses challenges to the synchronous coordination of this distributed human-centric manufacturing system. Failure in synchronization not only compromises overall system integrity, leading to unrealistic decision-making and potential harm to human health but also goes against the principles of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which proposes placing human wellbeing at the center of the production process for human-centric smart manufacturing in the future. In this context, this research presents real-time data-driven hyper objects orchestrating for the human-machine synchronization (RHYTHMS) based on a service-oriented human-to-machine architecture (SOH2M) and a model reference adaptive fuzzy control for real-time information sharing and synchronous coordination of the smart HMWS. Based on these, a real-life assembly case is carried out by a full-scale HMWS prototype to quantitatively analyze the benefits of the proposed approach in proactive ergonomic risk mitigation (PERM), contributing to the human-centric value-oriented I5.0 era.","[Ling, Shiquan] Shenzhen Polytech Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yanglang; Yan, Danqi; Leng, Yuquan; Rong, Yiming] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Energy Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Leng, Yuquan] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Human Augmentat & Rehabil R, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Leng, Yuquan; Huang, George Q.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hung Hom, Kowloon, 6-F,FJ Main Campus, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shenzhen Polytechnic University; Southern University of Science & Technology; Southern University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Leng, YQ; Huang, GQ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hung Hom, Kowloon, 6-F,FJ Main Campus, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lengyq@sustech.edu.cn; gq.huang@polyu.edu.hk,"Yan, Danqi/JVN-0264-2024; Huang, George/O-9005-2018; HUANG, George Q./C-1880-2009","HUANG, George Q./0000-0002-2362-6001; Yuan, Yanglang/0000-0001-7013-3480","RGC Theme-based Research Scheme [T32 -707/22-N]; RGC Collaborative Research Fund [C7076- 22GF]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52175272]; Science, Technology, and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality [JCYJ20220530114809021, KCXFZ202307310930 59012]; SZPU-ZWSOFT Industrial Software Development and Application R D Center [602331002PQ]","RGC Theme-based Research Scheme; RGC Collaborative Research Fund(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science, Technology, and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; SZPU-ZWSOFT Industrial Software Development and Application R D Center","This work was supported by the RGC Theme-based Research Scheme (No. T32 -707/22-N) , the RGC Collaborative Research Fund (No. C7076- 22GF) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52175272) , the Science, Technology, and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality (JCYJ20220530114809021, KCXFZ202307310930 59012) , and the SZPU-ZWSOFT Industrial Software Development and Application R & D Center (602331002PQ) .

As assembly tasks become increasingly complex and change rapidly, the cognitive load on employees increases. This leads to the use of assistance systems for manual assembly to detect and avoid human errors and thus ensure consistent product quality. Most of these systems promise to improve the production environment but have hardly been studied quantitatively so far. Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision have also not yet been fully exploited. This study aims to provide architectural, and implementational details of a state-of-the-art assembly assistance system based on an object detection model. The proposed architecture is intended to be representative of modern assistance systems. The error prevention potential is determined in a case study in which test subjects manually assemble a complex explosion-proof tubular lamp. The results show 51 % fewer assembly errors compared to a control group without assistance. Three of the four considered types of error classes have been reduced by at least 42 %. In particular, errors by omission are most likely to be prevented by the system. The reduction in the error rate is observed over the entire period of 30 consecutive product assemblies, comparing assisted and unassisted assembly. Furthermore, the recorded assembly data are found to be valuable regarding traceability and production improvement processes.","[Riedel, A.; Gerlach, J.; Dietsch, M.; Herbst, S.; Engelmann, F.; Brehm, N.; Pfeifroth, T.] Ernst Abbe Univ Appl Sci, Dept Ind Engn, Jena, Germany",,"Riedel, A (corresponding author), Ernst Abbe Univ Appl Sci, Dept Ind Engn, Jena, Germany.",alexander.riedel@eah-jena.de,,"Riedel, Alexander/0000-0002-1466-3206",Carl-Zeiss-Foundation,Carl-Zeiss-Foundation,The authors would like to thank the Carl-Zeiss-Foundation for their support within the research project Smart Assembly.

To guide human behavior, digital worker assistance systems can be used to support cognitive decision tasks and sensory perception tasks. In doing so, the design of the assistance systems affects user experience and work results. To optimize and develop human-centric productions systems, data on human behavior and interaction with manufacturing equipment must be collected and analyzed. This analysis is expected to yield benefits regarding process monitoring, quality assurance, user experience and ergonomics. In addition, the results could be used for training purposes to monitor skill improvements. This paper presents a framework for data acquisition and analysis of human interaction with digital worker assistance systems. In addition to the overall system architecture, the individual development steps are discussed. An eye tracking device and a motion capturing camera are used for data collection and provide live information about human behavior in conjunction with a digital worker assistance system. The data is stored in a database and analyzed by custom analysis algorithms. The results are displayed in a dashboard application and show that the presented framework with eye tracking and motion capturing is suitable for the analysis of human interaction with worker assistance systems.","[Hock, Fabian; Metternich, Joachim] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Prod Management Technol & Machine Tools PT, Otto Berndt Str 2, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Hock, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Prod Management Technol & Machine Tools PT, Otto Berndt Str 2, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",,,,Hessische Ministerium fur Digitale Strategie und Entwicklung,Hessische Ministerium fur Digitale Strategie und Entwicklung,The research leading to these results was conducted as part of the project Plattform dataPro and has received funding from the Forderprogramm Dist@l of the Hessische Ministerium fur Digitale Strategie und Entwicklung.,,24,0,0,0,0,Inst Production and Logistics Research GbR Herberger & Hubner,Offenburg,"Senator-Burda-Strasse 31a, Offenburg, GERMANY",2701-6277,,,Con Prod Sys Logisti,,,2023,,,,,,,100,109,,10.15488/15288,http://dx.doi.org/10.15488/15288,,,10,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BX5VG,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001304070400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

When deployed individually, neither of them fulfills the broad range of requirements, whereas a coordinated co-deployment suffers from the lack of efficient network management solutions as well as from insufficiently defined operating and owner structures for these mixed system deployments. Therefore, this work proposes a concept for an intelligent cross-domain 5G network management system and related optimization functions. In particular, the design of a cognitive, joint management of mobile industrial and cellular networks is outlined. Further, cognitive methods and virtualization techniques are motivated as major enablers. Advantages include an operator-grade network management of local industrial networks as well as a seamless integration with cellular networks. Following 5G design principles, the suggested network management system is also extensible to emerging radio access technologies (RATs) in the 5G context.","[Mannweiler, Christian; Schmelz, Lars Christoph] Nokia Networks, Munich, Germany; [Lohmueller, Simon; Bauer, Bernhard] Univ Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany",Nokia Corporation; University of Augsburg,"Mannweiler, C (corresponding author), Nokia Networks, Munich, Germany.",christian.mannweiler@nokia.com; christoph.schmelz@nokia.com; lohmueller@informatik.uni-augsburg.de; bauer@informatik.uni-augsburg.de,,"Bauer, Bernhard/0000-0002-7931-1105",,,,,14,4,4,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1542-1201,,978-1-5090-0223-8,IEEE IFIP NETW OPER,,,2016,,,,,,,868,872,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BG5ZX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000389830100128,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is a current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. The computerisation of manufacturing includes, amongst other, cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and cognitive computing. There are many challenges in the realisation of Industry 4.0. In order to adopt a smart factory and improved (software) processes many ethical considerations need to be identified and considered if a company is to obtain an ethical development and deployment of Industry 4.0. The purpose of normative ethics is to scrutinise standards about the rightness and wrongness of actions, the ultimate goal being the identification of the true human good. A rational appeal can be made to normative defensible ethical rules in order to arrive at a judicious, ethically justifiable judgement. In this position and constructive design research paper our steps are: First we report on the findings of a broad literature review of related research, which refers to the current challenges in the realisation of Industry 4.0. Second, we identify and list some basic generic Deontological and Teleological ethical principles and theories that can serve as normative guidelines for addressing the challenges identified in the initial step. Third, we prescribe a set of ethical rights and duties that must be exercised and fulfilled by protagonists/stakeholders in Industry 4.0 implementation in order for them to exhibit ethical behaviour. Each of these suggested actions are substantiated via an appeal to one, or a number of the normative guidelines, identified in the second step. By identifying and recommending a set of defensible ethical obligations that must be fulfilled in the development and deployment of smart factories, protagonists such as: employers, project managers, technology suppliers, trade unions, (on a microscopic level) and chambers of commerce, local and national government (on a macroscopic level) and other can fulfil their ethical duties. Thus, a deployed Industry 4.0 solution can result in technological change, social change and changes in the business paradigm, which are all ethically justifiable.

To solve the above problems, it is necessary to obtain the status and trend changes information and provide information support for the optimization of decision-making and dynamic adjustment of the production system. However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems. In addition, as a formal expression of information processing and knowledge learning process in cognitive informatics, the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model can effectively guide the construction of the production process cognitive mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cognitive framework based on OAR model of the human cognitive world for the dynamic cognitive needs of production system. The framework carries out dynamic cognition from the three dimensions of the manufacturing unit, production situation, and production system, and builds the continuous cognitive abilities from the three dimensions of analysis, decision-making, and learning. By integrating intelligent algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, a computable digital twin model is constructed as a carrier to provide the cognitive enabling technologies and capabilities for the production system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated by the developed computational digital twin platform. The computable digital twin platform provides the production system with important cognitive capabilities such as states perception, trend prediction, optimization decision-making, and knowledge learning, to support the dynamic cognition and optimization decision-making of the production system, and lay a technical foundation for adaptive production and cognitive manufacturing.","[Jiang, Tengyuan; Zhou, Jingtao; Zhao, Jianhua; Wang, Mingwei; Zhang, Shusheng] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab High Performance Mfg Aero Engine, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tengyuan; Zhou, Jingtao; Zhao, Jianhua; Wang, Mingwei; Zhang, Shusheng] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Adv Mfg Technol Aero Engine, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Zhou, JT (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Xian, Peoples R China.",jiangty_ame@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; zhoujt@nwpu.edu.cn; zhaojianhua481@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; wangmv@nwpu.edu.cn; zss_nwpu@163.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB1710300],National Key R&D Program of China,"The authors of the article expressed their gratitude to technical experts Qiao Yuan, Jian Shu, Gang Tong, and Jianfeng Li for their great help in the platform development process.

The information presentation factor involved using a text and number instruction compared to a photograph instruction, and situations with and without component variation were considered. Results show that assembly times and workload ratings were lower when using a kit, whereas using a material rack resulted in perceived decreased workflow and increased stress and frustration. Moreover, assembly times and workload ratings were lower when using photographs, whereas using text and numbers increased mental workload.

Therefore, the objective of this research is to assess the significance of considering HCI and usability issues at the early stage of developing any software system from Industry 4.0 perspective. To attain this objective, a prototypical application was developed to automate the lime production, control, and monitoring system from the Industry 4.0 perspective. Later, the system was evaluated by 9 participants (evaluators) using the Cognitive Walkthrough approach, and the prototype was refined based on its outcomes. The refined system was again evaluated by 11 participants following the Cognitive Walkthrough and showed that the usability improved due to considering the usability evaluation at the early stage of the development process of the application.","[Munim, Kazi Md; Islam, Iyolita; Rahman, Md Mahbubar; Islam, Muhammad Nazrul] Mil Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh",,"Munim, KM (corresponding author), Mil Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",kazimunim2014@gmail.com; iyolita2011@gmail.com; nazrul@cse.mist.ac.bd,"Islam, Muhammad/AAM-7533-2020",,,,,,34,4,4,0,12,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-0489-1,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/STI50764.2020.9350446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/STI50764.2020.9350446,,,6,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering,BR9ZK,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000680421300034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite growing research interest in the employee resilience area, there is limited knowledge of the process through which critical social support at workplaces, such as supportive leadership and co-worker support, affects employees' ability to cope in challenging situations. This study, underpinned by the theory of conservation of resources and social cognitive theory, examines the role of supportive leadership and co-worker support in employee resilience, and how this may be moderated by work pressures in the context of the Chinese banking industry. Using a sample of 2,025 Chinese banking workers, we tested four hypotheses. Our findings demonstrate that supportive leadership and co-worker support are positively associated with employee resilience. High work pressure moderates the relationship between both supportive leadership and co-worker support and employee resilience, such that the relationship between these conditions is stronger when perceived performance pressure is high. Our study raises important implications for both the theoretical development of employee resilience and for management practices with respect to fostering employee resilience in organisations.","[Cooke, Fang Lee] Monash Univ, Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, China & Monash Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Jue] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Bartram, Timothy] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Wang, J (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business, 555 Liu Tai Dao, Chengdu 610030, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",juewang8236@swufe.edu.cn,,"Varela, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-1480-0837","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC: 71372205, NSFC: 71673227, NSFC: 71832012]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We gratefully acknowledge financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC: 71372205) the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC: 71673227); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC: 71832012).,,74,74,87,7,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-994X,1464-0597,,APPL PSYCHOL-INT REV,Appl.

In the construction industry, there is a growing interest and expectation regarding the use of cobots to improve productivity and safety. Although evidence from other industrial applications supports the benefits of cobots in performance improvement, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, let alone the evaluation and validation in construction operations. In this study, we hypothesize that the presence of cobots releases construction workers from less productive motor actions and enables workers to focus on work planning activities, which is more closely related to productivity. To test the hypothesis, we implemented a prototype of human-robot collaboration for a valve manipulation task that is commonly seen in industrial facility turnaround shutdown. A virtual reality (VR) model was created as the experiment platform, where participants (n=20) were asked to operate 24 valves in a given sequence according to the provided instructional information. The efficiency and task performance of test subjects were examined to quantify the benefits of robotic assistance, which was measured with an eye tracker. The results indicate that with the physical assistance of cobots, task performance was improved, and the user cognitive patterns were more preferred as they could allocate more neural resources and attention time on activity planning instead of repetitive motor actions. The findings are expected to set a foundation for better visibility, enhanced responsiveness, and better collaboration in the labor-intensive industry.","[Zhu, Qi; Shi, Yangming; Du, Jing] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wei, Paul] Univ Florida, Dept Comp & Informat Sci & Engn, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",qizhu@ufl.edu; pwei1@ufl.edu; shiyangming@ufl.edu; eric.du@essie.ufl.edu,"Du, Jing/AHE-6199-2022; Shi, Yangming/AAT-8768-2021; Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024",,,,,,32,6,6,0,7,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8285-8,,,,2020,,,,,,,129,138,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering,BR4PZ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000652183800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results of this study are provided as a contribution to knowledge on the relationship between cognitive workload physiology and automation. Research suggests that changes in eye behavior metrics are related to changes in cognitive workload. Few studies have investigated the relationship between eye behavior metrics physiology measures and levels of automation. A within-subjects experiment involving 18 participants who played an open-source real-time strategy game was conducted. Three different versions of the game were developed, each with a unique static autonomy level designed from Sheridan and Verplank's 10 levels of autonomy (levels 2, 4, and 9). NASA-TLX subject survey ratings, time to complete run, and visual fixation rate were found to be significantly different among automation levels. These findings suggest that assessing visual physiology may be a promising indicator for evaluating cognitive workload when interacting with static autonomy levels. This efforts takes us one step closer to using visual physiology as a useful method for evaluating operator workload in almost real-time. Relevance to industry: Potential applications of this research include development of software that integrates adaptive automation to improve human-computer task performance for high cognitive workload tasks (Air Traffic Control, aircraft piloting, process control, information analyst, etc.).

Professional engineers are required when introducing and maintaining industrial robots. However, sometimes it is difficult for SMEs to do this by themselves because of economical limitations. Therefore, in many cases, they need to ask the outside for the support. To assist this situation, an aiding system for remote operation of industrial robots has been studied. This system provides information of the local site to an operator who is in the remote site using auditory and visual information. From this, the operator is able to perceive the working situation of the robot remotely. However, when several kinds of auditory information are presented at same time, recognition of the information becomes difficult. In addition, if too many kinds of visual information are presented, it is also difficult for the operator to pay attention appropriately. To solve the problem, we have proposed vibrotactile interfaces to assist information presentation for aiding remote operation of an industrial robot. In this paper, we attempt to present contact information using a vibrotactile glove when contact between an end-effector of a robot and an object occurs. We proposed two types of vibration stimuli to present the contact information. We investigate how human subjects correctly perceive the contact information through the vibration-based presentations compared with a visual based presentation. Subjects. performance of the contact information perception is evaluated based on perceived time, cognitive time and correct answer rate of the contact information.","[Yamazaki, Daisuke; Niitsuma, Mihoko] Chuo Univ, Dept Precis Mech, Tokyo, Japan",Chuo University,"Yamazaki, D (corresponding author), Chuo Univ, Dept Precis Mech, Tokyo, Japan.",yamazaki.daisuke.lab@gmail.com; niitsuma@mech.chuo-u.ac.jp,,"Niitsuma, Mihoko/0009-0008-3800-7319",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2158-2246,,978-1-5090-4688-1,C HUM SYST INTERACT,,,2017,,,,,,,172,177,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BJ5FB,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000425850600032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Machine vision is a technique that mainly performs human cognitive judgment in the industrial field or performs a task that is generally difficult for a human. However the detection of traditional methods of scanning with human eyes has many difficulties due to repetitive tasks. Recently, an artificial intelligence machine vision has been studied to improve these problems. Using the vision inspection system, it is possible to collect information such as the number of products, defect detection, and types without human intervention, which maximizes the operation-al efficiency of a company such as productivity improvement, quality improvement, and cost reduction. Most of the vision inspection systems currently in use are single-sided images, which collect and inspect one image of the product. However, in the actual manufacturing industry, products that are valid for single-sided image inspection are limited to some product groups, and most require multi-sided image inspection. In addition, the inspection system used in the field must meet the production speed required by the actual manufacturing site and inspect the defects of the product. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based vision inspection system that satisfies the multi-sided image inspection and fast production speed of products.

Common solutions relying on isolating the robots' workspace from human access during their operation are not applicable for HRI. This paper presents an extended reality-based method to enhance human cognitive awareness of the potential risk due to dynamic robot behavior towards safe human-robot collaborative manufacturing operations. A dynamic and state-aware occupancy probability map indicating the forthcoming risk of human-robot accidental collision in the 3D workspace of the robot is introduced. It is determined using octrees and is rendered in a virtual or augmented environment using Unity 3D. A combined framework allows the generation of both static zones (taking into consideration the entire configuration space of the robot) and dynamic zones (generated in real time by fetching the occupancy data corresponding to the robot's current configuration), which can be utilized for short-term collision risk prediction. This method is then applied in a virtual environment of the workspace of an industrial robotic arm, and we also include the necessary technical adjustments for the method to be applied in an AR setting.","[Anatoliotakis, Nikolaos; Paraskevopoulos, Giorgos; Michalakis, George; Michalellis, Isidoros; Zacharaki, Evangelia I.; Moustakas, Konstantinos] Univ Patras, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Visualizat & Virtual Real Grp VVR, Patras 26334, Greece; [Koustoumpardis, Panagiotis] Univ Patras, Dept Mech Engn & Aeronaut, Robot Grp, Patras 26334, Greece",University of Patras; University of Patras,"Anatoliotakis, N (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Visualizat & Virtual Real Grp VVR, Patras 26334, Greece.",n.anatoliotakis@ece.upatras.gr; gparaskevo@upnet.gr; gmichalakis@ece.upatras.gr; ece8412@upnet.gr; ezachar@upatras.gr; koust@upatras.gr; moustakas@upatras.gr,"Zacharaki, Evangelia/AAC-6661-2020; Koustoumpardis, Panagiotis/ABH-9038-2022","Zacharaki, Evangelia/0000-0001-8228-0437; Koustoumpardis, Panagiotis/0000-0002-3051-7321",European Union [871738],European Union(European Union (EU)),This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No 871738-CPSoSaware: Crosslayer cognitive optimization tools & amp; methods for the lifecycle support of dependable CPSoS,,23,1,1,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-1702,,MACHINES,Machines,AUG,2023,11,8,,,,,,,793,10.3390/machines11080793,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines11080793,,,14,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,Q4AY5,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-15,WOS:001056973100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For more than a decade, advancements in AR technology and their applications have been expected to revolutionise the manufacturing industry and deliver quality and productivity gains. However, due to factors such as equipment costs, skills shortages and technological limitations of AR devices, operational deployment beyond prototypes has been constrained. Real-world, usability studies can explore barriers to implementation and improve system design. This paper details a mixed method usability case study of an AR head-mounted display (HMD) to perform a short, simple visual inspection task. Twenty-two participants from South Australian manufacturing businesses inspected a pump and pipe skid while working at height. Overall, workload demands for the task were considered acceptable and just below the low workload threshold (NASA Task Load Index, mean = 29.3) and the system usability was rated average (system usability scale, mean = 68.5). The results suggest the task did not place too high a burden on users and was an appropriate initial exposure to AR HMDs, but further refinement to the interface would be desirable before implementation to minimise frustration and promote learning. Users were enthusiastic and open-minded about the AR HMD although results indicate that even with recent advancements in AR HMD technology, interactions between the task, technology and environment continue to cause human and technical challenges-some of which are relatively straightforward to address but others are dependent on larger-scale efforts.","[Howard, Sara; Jang, Ryan; O'Keeffe, Valerie; Manning, Kosta; Trott, Robert; Hordacre, Ann-Louise; Spoehr, John] Flinders Univ S Australia, Australian Ind Transformat Inst, Human Factors & Ergon Res Grp, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Howard, Sara] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Flinders University South Australia,"Howard, S (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",sara.howard@flinders.edu.au,"O'Keeffe, Valerie/AAX-6183-2020","Manning, Kosta/0000-0002-4143-0416; Jang, Ryan/0000-0001-9300-9052; Howard, Sara/0000-0002-9224-7494; Hordacre, Ann-Louise/0000-0001-5765-4863","the Australian Department of Industry, Science Energy and Resources; Council of Australian University Librarians","the Australian Department of Industry, Science Energy and Resources; Council of Australian University Librarians","This study is one part of a broader project funded by the Australian Department of Industry, Science Energy and Resources (Innovative Manufacturing CRC) in collaboration with BAE Systems Maritime Australia, which aims to derisk and accelerate the uptake and diffusion of Industry 4.0 technology into the shipyard and its manufacturing supply chain to promote sovereign capability.

In this paper we consider a cognitive approach to learning developed following the human cognitive ability and a scientific method of physics. The cognitive approach opens new wide directions towards control of industrial objects and situations that are not well structured and difficult to formalize, especially in real-life circumstances with significant uncertainty.

AR training, as a combination of industrial digital development and new interactive means, has attracted increasingly more attention. However, in human factor and education, research regarding AR based training is still in its infancy. To understand how AR could help industrial training from a human perspective, we evaluate a HoloLens-based AR training method for an assembly task on natural human behavior and the training effectiveness. Forty-four participants were equally divided into AR and ordinary training groups with the equivalent instructional materials, which included text information and 3D models. Results show that although AR did not significantly affect the overall workload and system usability assessment (SUS) recorded, several experimental values increased significantly compared with the ordinary training method, including task completion time, time required to interpret text-based information, amount of attention switching, and training effectiveness. Consequently, the use of AR did not result in a completion time and workload reduction; however, we found that training with the AR system was more effective than ordinary training in increasing the knowledge retention of participants without increasing their overall workload, especially for the month-term memory. Nonetheless, a longer time was required by the users to familiarize themselves with the AR environment and read the text information. The findings of this work could contribute to the design of future AR training systems in industry considering natural human behavior and enhance training effectiveness.","[Yang, Xiaonan; Mao, Wanting; Hu, Yaoguang; Wang, Jingfei; Wan, Xuanzhu; Fang, Haonan] Beijing Inst Technol, Dept Mfg Engn, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaonan; Hu, Yaoguang] Beijing Inst Technol, Yangtze Delta Reg Acad, Jiaxing 314019, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaonan; Hu, Yaoguang] Beijing Inst Technol, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Ind Knowledge & Data Fus Technol & Applica, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaonan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, 5th South Zhongguancun Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Yang, XN (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, 5th South Zhongguancun Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yangxn@bit.edu.cn; wantingm011@outlook.com; hyg@bit.edu.cn; 3120200449@bit.edu.cn; 1120200402@bit.edu.cn; 3120235091@bit.edu.cn,"yang, xiaonan/AAJ-2044-2020; Fang, Haonan/KWU-3450-2024",,"National Natural Science Foundation [52205513, 52175451]; State Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing for Special Vehicle and Transmission System [GZ2022KF012]",National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Smart Manufacturing for Special Vehicle and Transmission System,The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation (52205513 and 52175451) .

The proposed system, which is based on a residual convolutional neural network with 34 layers and a long -short term memory recurrent neural network (ResNet-34 + LSTM), obtains assembly context through action recognition of the tasks performed by the operator. The assembly context was then integrated in a collaborative assembly plan capable of autonomously commanding the robot tasks. The proposed model showed a great performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.65% and a temporal mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.11% for the action recognition of the considered assembly. Moreover, a task-oriented evaluation showed that the proposed cognitive system was able to leverage the performed human action recognition to command the adequate robot actions with near-perfect accuracy. As such, the proposed system was considered as successful at increasing the natural collaboration level of the considered assembly station.","[Moutinho, Duarte; Rocha, Luis F.; Costa, Carlos M.; Teixeira, Luis F.; Veiga, Germano] Inst Syst & Comp Engn Technol & Sci INESC TEC, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Moutinho, Duarte; Costa, Carlos M.; Teixeira, Luis F.] Univ Porto FEUP, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",INESC TEC; Universidade do Porto,"Moutinho, D (corresponding author), Inst Syst & Comp Engn Technol & Sci INESC TEC, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",duarteamoutinho@gmail.com,"da Costa, Carlos/Z-6191-2019; Veiga, Germano/D-1288-2012; Teixeira, Luis/E-1319-2011","Veiga, Germano/0000-0003-3044-6938; Rocha, Luis F./0000-0002-8680-4290; Teixeira, Luis/0000-0002-4050-7880","ERDF-European Regional Development Fund, through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation-COMPETE [PRODUTECH4SC, POCI-01-0247-FEDER-046102]","ERDF-European Regional Development Fund, through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation-COMPETE","This work is financed by the ERDF-European Regional Development Fund, through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation-COMPETE 2020 Programme under the Portugal 2020 Partnership Agreement within project PAC, with reference POCI-01-0247-FEDER-046095.

We foresee this limitation fails to address the human-centric approach of the Industry 5.0 paradigm. To overcome this challenge, an automated approach is proposed to enable user-guided ad hoc visualization forms, which ultimately increases users' situational awareness of supervised industrial processes. In this paper, we present a framework for introducing automated HMI design as a custom feature of standard SCADA-based HMI functionality and showcase an example of how open technology may be used for such purposes, thus opening new avenues for rapid innovation on SCADA HMI.

However, service actions are difficult to predict in front of a traditional CAD model. In this context, digital manufacturing tools and virtual simulation technologies can be validly used to create mixed digital environments where service tasks can be simulated in advance to support product design and improve maintenance actions. Furthermore, the use of human monitoring sensors can be used to detect the stressful conditions and to optimize the human tasks. The paper proposes a mixed reality (MR) set-up where operators are digitalized and monitored to analyse both physical and cognitive ergonomics. It is useful to predict design criticalities and improve the global system design. An industrial case study has been developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial to demonstrate how the proposed set-up is used for design for serviceability, on the basis of experimental evidence.

However, their presence poses safety risks to construction workers who work around them but have limited control and information about these drones. To ensure safety, general construction workers who are not part of the pilot teams should also be able to communicate their concerns with drones effectively and naturally. Despite its importance, research on human-drone communication within construction for non-operator workers is scarce. This study developed and evaluated communication protocols using gesture and speech modalities to ensure safe humandrone interactions for non-operator workers in construction environments. An immersive VR environment replicating construction site dynamics was developed, enabling workers to utilize gesture or speech communication protocols while working with drones. A total of 100 participants were recruited for the user-centered study analysis on an immersive VR construction site, and the safety implications and cognitive loads of both protocols were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that gesture-based communication is more effective than speech-based communication in mitigating risks and alleviating the negative impacts of drones without imposing additional cognitive strain on users on construction sites.","[Zhu, Zixian; Cheng, Jiun-Yao; Jeelani, Idris; Gheisari, Masoud] Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construction Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Zhu, ZX (corresponding author), Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construction Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",zhuzixian@ufl.edu; chengjiunyao@ufl.edu; idris.jeelani@ufl.edu; masoud@ufl.edu,"Jeelani, Idris/AAG-9436-2020; Cheng, Jiun-Yao/HKW-0776-2023",,National Science Foundation [2024656],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material was produced under the National Science Foundation Grant No. 2024656.

However, there is a lack of engineering methods and tools that are able to integrate their analysis with product and process optimisation according to sustainability principles. The present study proposes an analytical approach to support sustainable manufacturing (SM) by analysing the so-called user experience (UX) of manufacturing and assembly processes starting from the early design stages. Considering both behavioural and cognitive aspects of manufacturing UX and defining a corresponding model, it is possible to estimate the UX impact on manufacturing sustainability for a certain product and its related processes. The proposed method is implemented in a computer-based framework, which can be easily integrated with environmental and cost assessment tools to integrate all three SM aspects. Finally, a case study focused on automated machines is presented; the proposed approach was used to redesign the machine to improve its economic, environmental and human-related impacts. The industrial case study provides concrete evidence of the achievable benefits of applying the proposed model in manufacturing practice. Indeed, the case study demonstrated how the manufacturing and assembly process of a specific machine was optimised by simplifying the product structure, changing the adopted materials and creating more human-centred activities. The new solution is more sustainable due to time savings (-30%), cost reduction (-20%), reduced environmental impact (-25%) and improved UX (+30%).","[Peruzzini, Margherita; Pellicciari, Marcello] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Engn Enzo Ferrari, Modena, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Peruzzini, M (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Engn Enzo Ferrari, Modena, Italy.",margherita.peruzzini@unimore.it,"Pellicciari, Marcello/AAE-9293-2020; Pellicciari, Marcello/O-5284-2015; Peruzzini, Margherita/K-8165-2013","Pellicciari, Marcello/0000-0003-2578-4123; Peruzzini, Margherita/0000-0003-2260-0392",,,,,49,16,17,1,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

Hence, in many companies, it is performed by production planners or instructional designers. However, analysing product components and looking for clues on how these components can be fitted together into a subassembly or final product is a fundamental part of assembly. Product designers play an important role in the way these components are perceived by the operator. This paper discusses the need and importance of a new approach to product design focused on how the assembly design can promote meaning to the operator, supporting operator cognition. The aim of this approach was to guide assembly operators more intuitively through their increasingly complex tasks. Doing so will allow them to avoid some of the major drawbacks that are present when using procedural instructions. Hence, this approach has the potential to decrease cognitive load and frustration, and increase mental wellbeing, work motivation and efficiency. As a first step towards this new approach, a conceptual framework is constructed, and insights are formulated after reviewing various design theories and concepts of design for meaning on their potential in a context of manual assembly.","[Parmentier, Davy D.; Van Acker, Bram B.; Detand, Jan; Saldien, Jelle] Univ Ghent, Dept Ind Syst Engn & Prod Design, Graaf Karel Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium; [Van Acker, Bram B.] Univ Ghent, Dept Personnel Management Work & Org Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Acker, Bram B.; Saldien, Jelle] UGent, Mict, IMEC, Miriam Makebapl 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University; Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre,"Parmentier, DD (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Ind Syst Engn & Prod Design, Graaf Karel Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium.",davy.parmentier@ugent.be,"Detand, Jan/N-3508-2013; Saldien, Jelle/AAB-9135-2021","Saldien, Jelle/0000-0003-2557-3764; Detand, Jan/0000-0002-3857-7513; Parmentier, Davy/0000-0002-5582-5195",,,,,91,15,16,3,37,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1435-5558,1435-5566,,COGN TECHNOL WORK,Cogn.

During a transition to Logistics 4.0, it is necessary to consider all the issues that affect logistics, among which human factors (HF) are considered to be the most important. On the basis of the existing scientific literature, this article aimed to identify the relationships between 4.0 technologies implementation and HF concerning the evolution of human activities towards different hypothetical future scenarios (i.e., no changes, work replaced, or work assisted), analysing in detail the HF affected by 4.0 technologies. These relationships, which were summarised in a matrix, were also tested through a single longitudinal case study. The research showed that technology tends to replace logistics operators, not only for dangerous physical tasks but also for cognitive tasks that are stressful and repetitive. Moreover, for some tasks in which many different HF are involved, the evolution is towards operator assistance, rather than replacement.","[Cimini, Chiara; Lagorio, Alexandra; Pirola, Fabiana; Pinto, Roberto] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Viale Marconi 5, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Cimini, C (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Viale Marconi 5, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy.",chiara.cimini@unibg.it,"Lagorio, Alexandra/ABD-6319-2020","Pinto, Roberto/0000-0002-4370-4011; Lagorio, Alexandra/0000-0003-1489-0625; Pirola, Fabiana/0000-0003-4633-7568; Cimini, Chiara/0000-0001-8274-9821",,,,,70,22,23,5,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-8471,1520-6564,,HUM FACTOR ERGON MAN,Hum.

To this end, we posit that the HRI field should work beyond disciplines and include value-driven and plural perspectives through transdisciplinary research done with and for workers. However, WRRs and transdisciplinarity pose unique technical, design, and methodological challenges yet to be explored. We propose a workshop to engage the HRI community working on Industry 5.0, aiming at 1) taking stock of current WRR-related challenges in relevant disciplines, 2) collectively kick-off the exploration of a joint research agenda, 3) preliminary examining if and how transdisciplinarity could help the HRI community, and 4) start discussing how to deal with such complex knowledge integration in practice.","[Zaga, Cristina] Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands; [Lupetti, Maria Luce; Forster, Deborah; Murray-Rust, Dave; Prendergast, Micah; Abbink, David] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands",University of Twente; Delft University of Technology,"Zaga, C (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Enschede, Netherlands.",c.zaga@utwente.nl; m.l.lupetti@tudelft.nl; d.f.forster@tudelft.nl; d.s.murray-rust@tudelft.nl; j.m.prendergast@tudelft.nl; d.a.abbink@tudelft.nl,"Lupetti, Maria Luce/GPS-9270-2022; Abbink, David/G-2650-2015; Murray-Rust, Dave/C-9234-2011","Lupetti, Maria Luce/0000-0002-2425-8984; Abbink, David/0000-0001-7778-0090; Zaga;, Cristina;/0000-0003-2435-5706; Murray-Rust, Dave/0000-0001-6098-7861",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0323-2,,,,2024,,,,,,,1367,1369,,10.1145/3610978.3638156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3610978.3638156,,,3,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Robotics,BX1YC,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001255070800302,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Intelligent Factory Space (IFS) concept represents a framework for interaction between human and an automated system (digital factory). The IFS is composed of multiple layers (representing different services for the human user) and many modular components, which can be extended to the users' requirements. The IFS relies on industrial standards to communicate with existing machines while using novel two-way communication possibilities to feedback to the human user.

This study shows the development of a combinative assessment for the evaluation of mental workload in a comparative analysis of two assembly task scenarios, without and with robot interaction. The evaluation of mental workload is achieved through a combination of subjective (NASA TLX) and real-time objective measurements. This latter measurement is found using an innovative electroencephalogram (EEG) device and the characterization of the cognitive workload through the brainwave power ratio beta/alpha, defined after the pre-processing phase of EEG data. Finally, observational analyses are considered regarding the task performance of the two scenarios. The statistical analyses show how significantly the mental workload diminution and a higher level of performance, as the number of components assembled correctly by the participants, are achieved in the scenario with the robot.","[Caiazzo, Carlo; Savkovic, Marija; Milojevic, Djordje; Djapan, Marko] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Engn, Sestre Janj 6, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia; [Pusica, Milos] mBrainTrain Doo, Savska 19 G, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Pusica, Milos; Leva, Maria Chiara] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Environm Hlth, Dublin D07ADY7, Ireland",University of Kragujevac,"Djapan, M (corresponding author), Univ Kragujevac, Fac Engn, Sestre Janj 6, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",carlocaiazzo@fink.rs; marija.savkovic@kg.ac.rs; milos.pusica@mbraintrain.com; djordjemilojevic@gmail.com; mariachiara.leva@tudublin.ie; djapan@kg.ac.rs,"Djapan, Marko/AFY-1607-2022; Pušica, Miloš/JZE-1252-2024","Leva, Maria Chiara/0000-0002-6770-8332; Djapan, Marko/0000-0002-8016-8422; Pusica, Milos/0009-0003-4522-6222","European Commission, HORIZON 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Training Network Collaborative Intelligence for Safety Critical Systems, CISC","European Commission, HORIZON 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Training Network Collaborative Intelligence for Safety Critical Systems, CISC","Authors acknowledge Ivan Macuzic, Full professor of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Kragujevac, Serbia, for the support and inspiration of this research study.",,78,3,3,6,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-1702,,MACHINES,Machines,NOV,2023,11,11,,,,,,,995,10.3390/machines11110995,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines11110995,,,20,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,Z7NR7,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001113910900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The premises of Situation Awareness (SA) and Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) are the theoretical lens for conducting the present study. The objective of the study is the probabilistic modeling of the SA of process operators by means of complementarity among the premises of SA and DSA during shift change. The methodology used semi-structured interviews that followed a questionnaire created to categorize verbalizations at the three SA levels. Verbalizations were analyzed with the digital humanities approach that allowed the integrated modeling of SA using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) theory. The research was performed in an industrial plant that carried out a polymer injection process, which was classified as a physical arrangement for the continuous manufacture of products. In this process, production was conducted in three continuous shifts with one operator per shift. As a result, the BBN modeling showed the dynamic relationships among the core variables monitored, and also demonstrated the complementarity between SA and DSA. In this sense, BBN was used as a communication protocol between shifts and served as a mechanism that influences the operator's cognitive load. The developed algorithm showed an excellent performance, because it represents the conditional probability between the variables according to the operators' indications regarding the criticality and level of monitoring of the process. The modeling allowed representing the operators' complete SA, thus promoting DSA.","[Rosario, Claudio Roberto; Amaral, Fernando Goncalves] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Prod Engn, Av Osvaldo Aranha 99,5th Floor, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Malmann Kuffel, Fernando Jose] Univ Taquari Valley, Rua Avelino Talini 171, BR-95914014 Lajeado, RS, Brazil; [Kipper, Liane Mahlmann] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, Dept Sci Humanities & Educ, Av Independencia 2293,4th Floor,Room 5340, BR-98600000 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Frozza, Rejane] Dept Engn Architecture & Comp, Av Independencia 2293, BR-98600000 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade de Santa Cruz do Sul,"Rosário, CR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Prod Engn, Av Osvaldo Aranha 99,5th Floor, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",claudio.rosario@univates.br; amaral@producao.ufrgs.br; fernando.kuffel@universo.univates.br; liane@unisc.br; frozza@unisc.br,"Kipper, Liane/F-8937-2013; Goncalves Amaral, Fernando/G-2117-2012","Frozza, Rejane/0000-0002-3415-0870; Goncalves Amaral, Fernando/0000-0003-4581-9557; Rosario, Claudio R./0000-0002-7548-3380",,,,,67,5,5,3,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

However, despite the Oil&Gas (O&G) sector is one of the most hazardous environments where human error can have severe consequences, Industry 4.0 aspects are still scarcely integrated with HF/E. This paper calls for a holistic understanding of the changing role and responsibilities of workers in the O&G industry and aims at investigating to what extent, what type of, and how academic publications in the O&G field integrate HF/E and Industry 4.0 in their research. Bibliometric analysis has been conducted to provide useful insights to researchers and practitioners and to assess the status quo.

The design philosophy is changing, integrating to engineering contribution interpretative aspects (design thinking), executive practices (design doing) and cognitive aspects (design cultures). The design becomes human-centered. The new Virtual Reality technologies allow to validate performances of designed products and production processes by means of virtual prototypes in a virtual simulated environment. This approach generates several benefits to the companies, in terms of costs and time, and allows optimizing the assembly line design and related workplaces, by improving workers' benefits too. This paper proposes an innovative method to validate the design of workplaces on automotive assembly lines in a virtual environment, based on ergonomic approach, according to ERGO - Uas system, applied by FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) groups, that integrates UAS method for measurement and EAWS method for biomechanical effort evaluation. Creating 3D virtual scenarios allows to carry on assembly tasks by virtual manikins in order to be evaluated from different points of view. In particular, data coming from the simulation can be used to assess several ergonomic indexes, improving safety, quality and design. The analysis is supported by the use of a motion capture system, developed by the University of Campania and composed of wearable inertial sensors, that estimates the attitude of fundamental human segments, using sensor fusion algorithms based on Kalman filtering. In this way, it is possible to make a further design validation, assessing the EAWS index basing on posture angles trends evaluated. This method can represent an innovation for human-centered design of workplace in developing new products, reducing costs and improving job quality. Copyright (C) 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we compare the impact of three types of training approaches on the planning and problem-solving abilities of a trainee while he/she performs the Towers of Hanoi (TOH) task. The three approaches are (a) traditional (with a human trainer), (b) gamification (game-based training simulation), and (c) computer-aided training. The aim of this study is to evaluate a worker's level of functioning and problem-solving skills based on a specific training approach. Exact assessment of functional capacities is an important prerequisite to ensure effective and personalized training. The study uses work-place simulation to collect different types of performance data and assess the impact of these training approaches.","[Babu, Ashwin Ramesh; Rajavenkatanarayanan, Akilesh; Abujelala, Maher; Makedon, Fillia] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Heracleia Human Ctr Comp Lab, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Babu, AR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Heracleia Human Ctr Comp Lab, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",Ashwin.rameshbabu@mavs.uta.edu; Akilesh.rajavenkatanarayanan@mavs.uta.edu; maher.abujelala@mavs.uta.edu; makedon@uta.edu,"Ramesh Babu, Ashwin/AHB-4406-2022; Rajavenkatanarayanan, Akilesh/T-8291-2019",,"National Science Foundation [1338118, 1405985, 1565328]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1405985] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1565328] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)NSF - Division of Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS)),"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under award numbers 1338118, 1405985, and 1565328.",,15,11,13,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-57987-0; 978-3-319-57986-3,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2017,10280,,,,,,203,214,,10.1007/978-3-319-57987-0_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57987-0_16,,,12,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BL5QM,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000452460200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, an immersive and interactive cyber-physical system ((ICPS)-C-2) is suggested to achieve efficient collaboration between humans and autonomy. Virtual reality (VR) with a game engine, a new middlew are, and a data-to-information protocol were introduced for (ICPS)-C-2. This system was utilized in an autonomous robot grasping platform constructed by human skills and self-learning. The initial convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained by manual demonstration and showed 39% of the success rate of grasping blocks. After self-learning, the success rate increased to 70% As another human-inspired sensing technique, sound recognition system using ambient sound and the CNN model to predict the running state of the generator is proposed. The Mel spectrum based on human hearings was used as feature extraction. The overall running prediction accuracy of the evaluation dataset showed approximately 95% This system was applied for web-based remote and real-time monitoring of generators.","[Jun, Martin B.

The model needs to be modified to take into account an outcome that may not be dichotomous and to take into account the interaction between two macro factors: (a) Task complexity: that summarises all factors contributing to physical and mental workload requirements for execution of a given operative task & (b) Human capability: that considered the skills, training and experience of the people facing the tasks, representing a synthesis of their physical and cognitive abilities to verify whether or not they are matching the task requirements. Task complexity can be evaluated as a mathematical construct considering the compound effects of Mental Workload Demands and Physical Workload Demands associated to an operator task. Similarly, operator capability can be estimated on the basis of the operators' set of cognitive capabilities and physical conditions. The examples chosen for the application of the model were quite different: one is a set of assembly workstation in large computer manufacturing company and the other a set of workstations in the automotive sector. This paper presents and discusses the modelling hypothesis, the interim field data collection, results and possible future direction of the studies.","[Leva, Maria Chiara; Caimo, Alberto] Technol Univ Dublin, Coll Sci, Cent Quad, Dublin, Ireland; [Demichela, Micaela; Comberti, Lorenzo] Politecn Torino, DISAT, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Leva, MC (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Coll Sci, Cent Quad, Dublin, Ireland.",chiaraleva@gmail.com,"Demichela, Micaela/O-8072-2019",,European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [955901]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [955901] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),This paper was supported by the funding from the European Union?s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 955901 CISC project.,,21,3,3,6,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

A user study on augmented reality maintenance instructions in blind areas,COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Augmented reality; Maintenance; Blind area; Occlusion; Work instructions; Industrial operator support,OCCLUSION,"In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) has been effectively proposed as a tool to support workers in manual procedural tasks in industry, such as assembly and maintenance. It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers' performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces.","[Laviola, Enricoandrea; Gattullo, Michele; Evangelista, Alessandro; Fiorentino, Michele; Uva, Antonio Emmanuele] Polytech Inst Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Via Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Gattullo, M (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Via Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",enricoandrea.laviola@poliba.it; michele.gattullo@poliba.it; alessandro.evangelista@poliba.it; michele.fiorentino@poliba.it; antonio.uva@poliba.it,"Evangelista, Alessandro/AAO-7025-2021; Fiorentino, Michele/M-6976-2015; Uva, Antonio/A-9673-2012; Gattullo, Michele/AAG-4866-2021","Gattullo, Michele/0000-0003-4487-0457; Laviola, Enricoandrea/0000-0002-7625-511X",,,,,51,15,15,1,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-3615,1872-6194,,COMPUT IND,Comput.

Background: Mental fatigue has been recognized as one of the most important factors influencing individual performance. Subjective and physiological measures are popular methods for analyzing fatigue, but they are restricted to physical experiments. Computational cognitive models are useful for predicting operator performance and can be used for analyzing fatigue in the design phase, particularly in industrial operations and inspections where cognitive tasks are frequent and the effects of mental fatigue are crucial. Method: A cyclic mental task is modeled by the ACT-R architecture, and the effect of mental fatigue on response time and error rate is studied. The task includes visual inspections in a production line or control workstation where an operator has to check products' conformity to specifications. Initially, simulated and experimental results are compared using correlation coefficients and paired t test statistics. After validation of the model, the effects are studied by human and simulated results, which are obtained by running 50-minute tests. Results: It is revealed that during the last 20 minutes of the tests, the response time increased by 20%, and during the last 12.5 minutes, the error rate increased by 7% on average. Conclusion: The proper start time for the rest period can be identified by setting a limit on the error rate or response time. Application: The proposed model can be applied early in production planning to decrease the negative effects of mental fatigue by predicting the operator performance. It can also be used for determining the rest breaks in the design phase without an operator in the loop.","[Atashfeshan, Nooshin; Razavi, Hamideh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran",Ferdowsi University Mashhad,"Razavi, H (corresponding author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Engn, POB 9177948974, Mashhad, Iran.",h-razavi@um.ac.ir,"Razavi, Hamideh/AAD-1063-2020","Razavi, Hamideh/0000-0003-1837-7933",,,,,56,5,6,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Moreover, not only sensors should be considered, but also actuators, especially robots in the industry domain. In this context Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies provide powerful capabilities to endow IoT devices with intelligent services, leading to the so-called Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT).

Elastic haptic bands are used to suggest walking-pace during an exercise aimed at reproducing real industrial or human-robot cooperation task. The proposed system consists of two wearable interfaces for providing timing information to the users, and a pressure sensor to estimate the real gait pattern, thus resulting in a combination of walking-state monitoring and vibro-tactile stimuli to regulate the walking pace. Vibrational stimuli with a constant presentation interval are alternately and repeatedly given to the right and left side of the human body, in accordance with the desired walking cadence. We tested two different interface placements: wrists and ankles. The guidance system has been evaluated under mental and manual workload using an additional task: balancing a small sphere in the center of a flat surface. Experimental results revealed that subjects prefer the ankle position for what concerns wearability, comfort and easiness in task execution. Examples of the proposed approach in daily use are training and coaching in sports, rehabilitation, and human-robot cooperation and interaction.","[Baldi, Tommaso Lisini; Paolocci, Gianluca; Prattichizzo, Domenico] Univ Siena, Dept Informat Engn & Math, Via Roma 56, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Baldi, Tommaso Lisini; Paolocci, Gianluca; Prattichizzo, Domenico] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Dept Adv Robot, Via Morego 30, I-16163 Genoa, Italy",University of Siena; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT,"Baldi, TL (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Informat Engn & Math, Via Roma 56, I-53100 Siena, Italy.;Baldi, TL (corresponding author), Ist Italiano Tecnol, Dept Adv Robot, Via Morego 30, I-16163 Genoa, Italy.",lisini@diism.unisi.it; paolocci@diism.unisi.it; prattichizzo@diism.unisi.it,"Paolocci, Gianluca/IAR-8921-2023; Lisini Baldi, Tommaso/GRJ-7214-2022","Lisini Baldi, Tommaso/0000-0002-2930-955X",European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme - Societal Challenge 1 (DG CONNECT/H) under the project ACANTO: A CyberphysicAl social NeTwOrk using robot friends [643644],European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme - Societal Challenge 1 (DG CONNECT/H) under the project ACANTO: A CyberphysicAl social NeTwOrk using robot friends,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme - Societal Challenge 1 (DG CONNECT/H) under grant agreement n. 643644 of the project ACANTO: A CyberphysicAl social NeTwOrk using robot friends.,,22,6,6,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-93399-3; 978-3-319-93398-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,10894,,,,,,416,427,,10.1007/978-3-319-93399-3_36,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93399-3_36,,,12,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BM0AU,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000458561800036,View Full Record in Web of Science

The increase in product variability directly impacts the complexity of the manufacturing process and consequently increases the possibility for human-generated error. Several solutions have been offered to reduce the potential risk of error in complex assembly processes which can be generalized as cognitive-based or physical-based assistive methods. Creating a digital twin of the process, both the human and machine elements, is a preliminary requirement before deploying such solutions in a real-world manufacturing environment. The digital twin simulation provides a platform for testing a variety of solutions and what-if scenarios to improve planning and decision making. While there exist commercially available products of human digital twin modeling, these do not provide a proper platform for human machine interaction modeling. In the context of this work, machine is defined as an industrial robot with an objective of investigating the feasibility of deploying a smart collaborative robotic solution to provide physical assistance to the human worker in a cumbersome manufacturing process. To do so, an overhead assembly operation from a real-world vehicle assembly plant is identified, and a digital twin of human model is created in Siemens Tecnomatix suite. The study starts with the simulation of various human anthropomorphic models to discover the limitations in performing the assembly tasks based on gender, weight and height. Furthermore, a digital twin of a mobile robot designed to provide physical assistance to the human to perform the assembly operation is introduced. The results are evaluated in terms of process time, joint ergonomic impact and reveal some current limitations of combined digital twin modeling of humans and robots collaborating.

Its outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication, consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing.","[Becue, Adrien] AIRBUS CyberSecur, F-78996 Elancourt, France; [Maia, Eva; Praca, Isabel] Polytech Porto ISEP IPP GECAD, Sch Engn, P-4249015 Porto, Portugal; [Feeken, Linda; Borchers, Philipp] OFFIS eV, Inst Informat, D-26121 Oldenburg, Germany",Airbus; Airbus France S.A.S.; Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Borchers, P (corresponding author), OFFIS eV, Inst Informat, D-26121 Oldenburg, Germany.",adrien.becue@airbus.com; egm@isep.ipp.pt; linda.feeken@offis.de; philipp.borchers@offis.de; icp@isep.ipp.pt,"Maia, Eva/AAR-1161-2021; Praca, Isabel/K-8430-2014","BECUE, Adrien/0000-0002-9328-9581; Praca, Isabel/0000-0002-2519-9859; Maia, Eva/0000-0002-8075-531X","EUREKA-ITEA3 Project CyberFactory [ITEA-17032]; Project CyberFactory [ANI\P2020 40124]; FEDER Funds through NORTE2020 program; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Germany) [01IS18061C]; FCT [UID/EEA/00760/2019]","EUREKA-ITEA3 Project CyberFactory; Project CyberFactory; FEDER Funds through NORTE2020 program; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Germany)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The present work was developed under the EUREKA-ITEA3 Project CyberFactory#1 (ITEA-17032), co-funded by Project CyberFactory#1PT (ANI vertical bar P2020 40124), from FEDER Funds through NORTE2020 program and from National Funds through FCT under the project UID/EEA/00760/2019 and by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Germany, funding No. 01IS18061C).",,119,81,87,7,88,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Unobtrusive objective measures of mental workload (MWL) are therefore in high demand as indicated by both theory and practice. This pilot study explored the wearability and external validity of pupillometry, a MWL measure robustly validated in laboratory settings and now deployable in work settings demanding operator mobility. In an ecologically valid work environment, 21 participants performed two manual assemblies - one of low and one of high complexity - while wearing eye-tracking glasses for pupil size measurement. Results revealed that the device was perceived as fairly wearable in terms of physical and mental comfort. In terms of validity, no significant differences in mean pupil size were found between the assemblies even though subjective mental workload differed significantly. Exploratory analyses on the pupil size when attending to the assembly instructions only, were inconclusive. The present work suggests that current lab-based procedures might not be adequate yet for in-the-field mobile pupillometry. From a broader perspective, these findings also invite a more nuanced view on the current validity of lab-validated physiological MWL-measures when applied in real-life settings. We therefore conclude with some key insights for future development of mobile pupillometry.","[Van Acker, Bram B.; Parmentier, Davy D.; Mateus, Joao Costa; Biondi, Alessandro; Saldien, Jelle] Univ Ghent, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Ind Syst & Prod Design, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 46, B-9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium; [Van Acker, Bram B.; Vlerick, Peter] Univ Ghent, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Dept Personnel Management Work & Org Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Acker, Bram B.; Bombeke, Klaas; Durnez, Wouter; Saldien, Jelle] Univ Ghent, Res Grp IMEC MICT, Miriam Makebapl 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University,"Van Acker, BB (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Ind Syst & Prod Design, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 46, B-9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium.",bramb.vanacker@ugent.be,"Mateus, João/AAV-9622-2020; Saldien, Jelle/AAB-9135-2021; Biondi, Alessandro/AAL-9163-2020","Parmentier, Davy/0000-0002-5582-5195; Vlerick, Peter/0000-0001-9624-1025; Durnez, Wouter/0000-0001-8045-8801; Saldien, Jelle/0000-0003-2557-3764","strategic research centre for the manufacturing industry Flanders Make, Oude Diestersebaan, Lommel, Belgium, as part of the SBO project 'Augmented workers using smart robots in a manufacturing cell (Yves)'","strategic research centre for the manufacturing industry Flanders Make, Oude Diestersebaan, Lommel, Belgium, as part of the SBO project 'Augmented workers using smart robots in a manufacturing cell (Yves)'","This work was supported by the strategic research centre for the manufacturing industry Flanders Make, Oude Diestersebaan, 133, 3920 Lommel, Belgium, as part of the SBO project 'Augmented workers using smart robots in a manufacturing cell (Yves)'.",,116,23,25,0,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-8141,1872-8219,,INT J IND ERGONOM,Int.

Eye-tracking metrics can help understand the dynamics of fluctuating mental workload over the course of learning.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to test eye-tracking measures' sensitivity and reliability to variations in task difficulty, as well as their performance-prediction capability, in physical human-robot collaboration tasks involving an industrial robot for object comanipulation.MethodsParticipants (9M, 9F) learned to coperform a virtual pick-and-place task with a bimanual robot over multiple trials. Joint stiffness of the robot was manipulated to increase motor-coordination demands. The psychometric properties of eye-tracking measures and their ability to predict performance was investigated.ResultsStationary Gaze Entropy and pupil diameter were the most reliable and sensitive measures of workload associated with changes in task difficulty and learning. Increased task difficulty was more likely to result in a robot-monitoring strategy. Eye-tracking measures were able to predict the occurrence of success or failure in each trial with 70% sensitivity and 71% accuracy.ConclusionThe sensitivity and reliability of eye-tracking measures was acceptable, although values were lower than those observed in cognitive domains. Measures of gaze behaviors indicative of visual monitoring strategies were most sensitive to task difficulty manipulations, and should be explored further for the pHRI domain where motor-control and internal-model formation will likely be strong contributors to workload.ApplicationFuture collaborative robots can adapt to human cognitive state and skill-level measured using eye-tracking measures of workload and visual attention.","[Upasani, Satyajit; Leonessa, Alexander] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Srinivasan, Divya] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC USA; [Zhu, Qi] NIST, Boulder, CO USA; [Du, Jing] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Clemson University; National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Srinivasan, D (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",sriniv5@clemson.edu,"Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024","Srinivasan, Divya/0000-0001-9327-6177; Upasani, Satyajit/0000-0002-3328-5968","Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation","Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation (grants CMMI-2024772 and CMMI-2242610).

The key influential indicators of the tax forecast are obtained by analyzing the principal components affecting the tax index. In addition, a human-computer interaction (HCI) system is established based on cognitive psychology theory to improve the user-friendliness of tax analysis. At the same time, the tax data of the ceramic industry in Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province in different years are used for the empirical analysis of the tax prediction of different prediction models, including particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and fusion algorithm (FA), and support vector machine (SVM). This work comprehensively analyzes the influence of the optimized tax supervision mode on the economic development of the ceramic industry and provides ideas for the development of the ceramic industry in Jingdezhen. The research results demonstrate that the main indicator affecting tax revenue is the added value of the primary and secondary industries. The optimized SVM based on grid search method can provide a comprehensive data base for tax forecasting. The optimization of the computer system based on cognitive psychology improves the model prediction accuracy by 10%, and the absolute error decreases from 6.9 to 1.8%. The tax forecast results indicate that the tax imbalance in Jingdezhen is increasing. Therefore, the government needs to attach great importance to the development of the ceramic industry and strictly implement the tax policy. The tax supervision model can alleviate the problems of low fiscal contribution rate, tax evasion, and management loopholes. In addition, the SVM tax prediction model optimized by grid search method will lay a theoretical foundation for the research and application of taxation in the ceramic industry.","[Jiao, Mingqing] Jingdezhen Ceram Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Jingdezhen, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Mingqing] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Jiao, MQ (corresponding author), Jingdezhen Ceram Univ, Sch Management & Econ, Jingdezhen, Peoples R China.;Jiao, MQ (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",025515@jci.edu.cn,,,,,,,30,0,0,5,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Nevertheless, existing HRC systems suffer from poor task understanding and poor ergonomic satisfaction, which impede empathetic teamwork skills in task execution. To overcome the bottleneck, a Mixed Reality (MR) and visual reasoning-based method is proposed in this research, providing mutual-cognitive task assignment for human and robotic agents' operations. Firstly, an MR-enabled mutual-cognitive HRC architecture is proposed, with the characteristic of monitoring Digital Twins states, reasoning co-working strategies, and providing cognitive services. Secondly, a visual reasoning approach is introduced, which learns scene interpretation from the visual perception of each agent's actions and environmental changes to make task planning strategies satisfying human-robot operation needs. Lastly, a safe, ergonomic, and proactive robot motion planning algorithm is proposed to let a robot execute generated co-working strategies, while a human operator is supported with intuitive task operation guidance in the MR environment, achieving empathetic collaboration. Through a demonstration of a disassembly task of aging Electric Vehicle Batteries, the experimental result facilitates cognitive intelligence in Proactive HRC for flexible automation.","[Li, Shufei; Zheng, Pai] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Shufei; Wang, Xi Vincent; Wang, Lihui] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [You, Yingchao] Univ Cardiff, Sch Engn, Cardiff, Wales",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Royal Institute of Technology; Cardiff University,"Zheng, P (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Wang, LH (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Stockholm, Sweden.",pai.zheng@polyu.edu.hk; lihui.wang@iip.kth.se,"Li, Shufei/GZB-2215-2022; ZHENG, PAI/K-7989-2012; Wang, Vincent/AAP-4776-2020; Wang, Xi Vincent/O-4662-2014; Wang, Lihui/O-3907-2014","Wang, Xi Vincent/0000-0001-9694-0483; Li, Shufei/0000-0002-5684-6756; Wang, Lihui/0000-0001-8679-8049; You, Yingchao/0000-0002-4193-3304; ZHENG, PAI/0000-0002-2329-8634",National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),No Statement Available,,43,1,1,25,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2472-5854,2472-5862,,IISE TRANS,IISE Trans.,OCT 2,2024,56,10,,,SI,,1099,1111,,10.1080/24725854.2024.2313647,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2024.2313647,,FEB 2024,13,"Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,YK4D5,,hybrid,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001182637400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Optimization of assembly and training of staff requires a series of demo installations and excessive use of costly operational resources. In some cases, components are located at different sites, making the orchestration of the whole system even more difficult. Virtual Reality (VR) collaboration environments offer a solution by enabling high fidelity testing and training of complex manufacturing systems. On the other hand, such platforms are difficult to implement in an engineering perspective, as they are required to provide reliable, standard interfaces towards both robotic components and human operators. The VirCA (Virtual Collaboration Arena) platform is a software framework that supports various means of collaboration through the use of 3D augmented/virtual reality as a communication medium. VirCA offers functions for the high-level interoperability of heterogeneous components in a wide range of domains, spanning from research & development, through remote education to orchestration and management of industrial processes in manufacturing applications. This paper provides an overview of the industrial requirements behind high-fidelity virtual collaboration and demonstrates how the VirCA platform meets these requirements.

Before digitizing knowledge, a fundamental question arises: What is knowledge? In order to answer this question, this study first reviews the definitions of knowledge found in the extant literature of epistemology, engineering design, manufacturing, organization science, information science, and education science. Since the definitions reported so far are not succinct and suffer circularity, this study overcomes this by introducing a three-element-based definition of knowledge-a piece knowledge consists of three elements defined as claim, provenance, and inference. This results in four types of knowledge defined as definitional, deductive, inductive, and creative knowledge, and each type of knowledge is again divided into some categories. Some real-life scenarios relevant to engineering design and manufacturing are used to clarify the proposed knowledge types/categories; the relevant pieces of knowledge are represented by knowledge graphs (concept maps) for the sake of digitization. The myriad proximal and distal relationships between knowledge and other relevant entities (human/machine learning, logical inferences, experimental data, analytical results, creative thinking, and cognitive reflections) become succinct and transparent due to the proposed definition of knowledge. Consequently, this study establishes the fundamentals of developing sophisticated methods and tools for the advancement of Industry 4.0.","[Ullah, A. M. M.

Most MNF systems, despite advances in technology and machinery, still rely on executing predefined instructions, limiting their flexibility. In contrast, human workers excel at handling product variations due to their cognitive abilities, which allow them to perceive, analyze, and make appropriate decisions to adapt to changing conditions. This study introduces virtual numerical control (VNC) as a solution to upgrade MNF systems and overcome these limitations. VNC aims to transform MNF systems into cognitive entities capable of autonomous decision-making, enabling greater flexibility to meet customization demands. To demonstrate the potential of VNC, we implemented it in a welding system as a practical case study. The results showed that VNC enabled the system to operate autonomously. It accurately identified the shape of the objects to be welded, determined the appropriate welding paths, and executed them with high precision, all without human intervention. This highlights the significant potential of VNC technology for broader applications in industrial automation in welding and beyond.","[Nasser, Mohamed A.; Asy, Mohab M.] Menoufia Univ, Fac Engn, Prod Engn & Mech Design Dept, Menoufia, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Menofia University,"Asy, MM (corresponding author), Menoufia Univ, Fac Engn, Prod Engn & Mech Design Dept, Menoufia, Egypt.",mouhab.assi.eng@sh-eng.menofia.edu.eg,"Asy, Mohab/JLM-0266-2023","Asy, Mohab Mahmoud/0009-0008-7137-2836","Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)","Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF)(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)(Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB))","Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).",,45,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

It proposes the use of a representational learning approach that adopts techniques from industrial internet of things (IoT) solutions. It applies this approach to the classification of emotional states using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor data. The algorithm used first pre-processes the data using a combination of signal processing and vector quantization techniques. Next, it found the optimal number of natural clusters within human emotional states and used these as the target variables for either shallow or for deep learning classification. The deep learning variant used a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to form a compressive representation of the input data prior to classification. A final single layer perception model learned the relationship between the input and output states. This approach would be useful for detecting real-time changes in human emotional state. It is able automatically create emotional states that are both highly separable and balanced. It is able to distinguish between low v. high emotional states across all tasks (F1-score of 71.4%) and is better at forming this distinction for tasks intended to elicit higher cognitive load such as the Tetris video game (F1-score of 87.1%) or the Multi Attribute Task Battery (F1-score of 77%).","[Kirk, Ryan A.] Kirk LLC, Seattle, WA 98119 USA",,"Kirk, RA (corresponding author), Kirk LLC, Seattle, WA 98119 USA.",info@ryankirk.info,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-58628-1; 978-3-319-58627-4,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2017,10284,,I,,,,323,341,,10.1007/978-3-319-58628-1_26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58628-1_26,,,19,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BL3FL,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000449655200026,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this emerging field of research, there has been a strong drive towards modelling human-like characteristics and behaviors in chatbots. However, only a limited number of research endeavors have focused on a chatbot for automatic characterization of end-user emotions. In order to address this limitation, we propose an artificial intelligence based cognitive model for emotion awareness in chatbots using Markov chains, word embedding, and Natural Language Processing. The proposed model is able to extract emotions from conversations, detect emotion transitions over time, predict real-time emotions and intelligently profile human participants based on their distinct emotional characteristics. We conducted experiments using a real-world end-user dataset to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed model. Results from experiments confirm the plausibility of this model for emotion awareness in industrial conversational agents.","[Adikari, Achini; De Silva, Daswin; Alahakoon, Damminda] La Trobe Univ, Res Ctr Data Analyt & Cognit, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Yu, Xinghuo] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",La Trobe University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Adikari, A (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Res Ctr Data Analyt & Cognit, Bundoora, Vic, Australia.",A.Adikari@latrobe.edu.au; D.DeSilva@latrobe.edu.au; D.Alahakoon@latrobe.edu.au; x.yu@rmit.edu.au,"des, d/GVU-7765-2022; Sui, Xinghua/HZM-5992-2023","Adikari, Achini/0000-0001-5112-5063",La Trobe University Postgraduate Research Scholarship,La Trobe University Postgraduate Research Scholarship,This work was supported by a La Trobe University Postgraduate Research Scholarship.,,16,21,22,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1935-4576,,978-1-7281-2927-3,IEEE INTL CONF IND I,,,2019,,,,,,,183,186,,10.1109/indin41052.2019.8972196,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/indin41052.2019.8972196,,,4,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BO8XJ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000529510400025,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper tries to enhance such a process by supporting operators with an AR application that shows the work instructions and allows reducing their cognitive workload. The main goals are to propose a user-friendly and versatile tool and carry out a structured and complete evaluation of the user experience. Two experimental sessions were conducted in the laboratory by simulating the wire harness assembly and quality inspection.

The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators' detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.","[Shi, Chao] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, 4400 Vestal Pkwy East, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Rothrock, Ling] Penn State Univ, Harold & Inge Marcus Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, 310 Leonhard Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Shi, C (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, 4400 Vestal Pkwy East, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",cshi@binghamton.edu; lxr28@psu.edu,"Shi, Chao/KWU-4188-2024","Rothrock, Ling/0000-0001-7614-5132",Abnormal Situation Management Consortium Support,Abnormal Situation Management Consortium Support,This work was supported by Abnormal Situation Management Consortium Support.,,34,5,5,5,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

This innate ability enables the manual inspection of components in manufacturing environments. Trained inspectors combine their senses and handling skills with bespoke non-destructive testing instrumentation. However, manual inspections can be slow for large and/or complex geometries and prone to human factors. Automated non-destructive testing systems have emerged in recent years, to increase data acquisition speed, part coverage and inspection reliability. These tools work well when the robotic inspection takes place in a well-structured environment and an accurate part model is available. However, precisely registering the position of a part in the robot reference system makes the inspection setup very time-consuming. Furthermore, the geometry of a part may differ from its digital model, spoiling the inspection accuracy. This work introduces a new approach that mimics the human perception capability and gives full manipulation autonomy to robotic sensing applications. We use a single robotized sensor to introduce a fully autonomous single-pass geometric and volumetric inspection of complex parts. Our approach can be used to solve some key challenges in quality assurance for Industry 4.0 and can find applicability beyond robotic non-destructive testing.","[Mineo, Carmelo; Maniscalco, Umberto] Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking ICAR, I-90146 Palermo, Italy; [Cerniglia, Donatella] Univ Palermo, Dept Engn, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Calcolo e Reti ad Alte Prestazioni (ICAR-CNR); University of Palermo,"Mineo, C (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking ICAR, I-90146 Palermo, Italy.",carmelo.mineo@icar.cnr.it,"Maniscalco, Umberto/GWC-0660-2022",,European Union [835846]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [835846] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie grant agreement No 835846.,,12,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-8859-1,,,,2022,,,,,,,505,510,,10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900651,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900651,,,6,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Ergonomics; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BU2LT,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000885903300073,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although HRC increases productivity and efficacy, it exposes human workers to psychological stress while interfacing with collaborative robotic systems as robots may not provide visual or auditory cues. It is crucial to comprehend how HRC impacts mental stress in order to enhance occupational safety and well-being. Though academics and industrial interest in HRC is expanding, safety and mental stress problems are still not adequately studied. In particular, human coworkers' cognitive strain during HRC has not been explored well, although being fundamental to sustaining a secure and constructive workplace environment. This study, therefore, aims to monitor the mental stress of factory workers during HRC using behavioural, physiological and subjective measures. Physiological measures, being objective and more authentic, have the potential to replace conventional measures i.e., behavioural and subjective measures, if they demonstrate a good correlation with traditional measures. Two neuroimaging modalities including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been used as physiological measures to track neuronal and hemodynamic activity of the brain, respectively. Here, the correlation between physiological data and behavioural and subjective measurements has been ascertained through the implementation of seven different machine learning algorithms. The results imply that the EEG and fNIRS features combined produced the best results for most of the targets. For subjective measures being the target, linear regression has outperformed all other models, whereas tree and ensemble performed the best for predicting the behavioural measures. The outcomes indicate that physiological measures have the potential to be more informative and often substitute other skewed metrics.","[Arif, Arshia; Zakeri, Zohreh; Omurtag, Ahmet; Breedon, Philip; Khalid, Azfar] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England",Nottingham Trent University,"Arif, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England.",arshia.arif2021@my.ntu.ac.uk; zohreh.zakeri@ntu.ac.uk; ahmet.omurtag@ntu.ac.uk; philip.breedon@ntu.ac.uk; azfar.khalid@ntu.ac.uk,,,"Connected Everything (CE II) Feasibility Studies, Engineering & Physical Science Research Council [4811539]; Connected Everything (CE II) Feasibility Studies, Engineering & Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) [M410809752]; PepsiCo Europe; PepsiCo International Limited","Connected Everything (CE II) Feasibility Studies, Engineering & Physical Science Research Council; Connected Everything (CE II) Feasibility Studies, Engineering & Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC); PepsiCo Europe; PepsiCo International Limited","This research was funded by Connected Everything (CE II) Feasibility Studies, Engineering & Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC Award reference No. 4811539) and PepsiCo Europe (Funder Award Reference: M410809752) and The APC was partly funded by PepsiCo International Limited.",,63,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2078-2489,,INFORMATION,Information,OCT,2024,15,10,,,,,,,640,10.3390/info15100640,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info15100640,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,K1Y4S,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001341904200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The difference between education training's spillover effect and the relative marginal production factor's productivity is calculated by using the fidelity model. In this way, labour cognitive level can be quantified.

Industry 5.0 introduces concepts like biomanufacturing and human-centricity, embodying the integration of sustainability and resiliency principles in CEE, thereby shaping the upskilling and reskilling initiatives for the future workforce. The interaction of sophisticated concepts such as Human-Machine Interface and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) forms a conceptual bridge toward the approaching Fifth Industrial Revolution, allowing one to understand human beings and the impact of their biological development across diverse and changing workplace settings.Methods Our research is based on recent studies into Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities taxonomies, linking these elements with dynamic labor market profiles. This work intends to integrate a biometric perspective to conceptualize and describe how cognitive abilities could be represented by linking a Neuropsychological test and a biometric assessment. We administered the brief Neuropsychological Battery in Spanish (Neuropsi Breve). At the same time, 15 engineering students used the Emotiv insight device that allowed the EEG recollection to measure performance metrics such as attention, stress, engagement, and excitement.Results The findings of this research illustrate a methodology that allowed the first approach to the cognitive abilities of engineering students to be from neurobiological and behavioral perspectives. Additionally, two profiles were extracted from the results. The first illustrates the Neuropsi test areas, its most common mistakes, and its performance ratings regarding the students' sample. The second profile shows the interaction between the EEG and Neuropsi test, showing engineering students' cognitive and emotional states based on biometric levels.Discussions The study demonstrates the potential of integrating neurobiological assessment into engineering education, highlighting a significant advancement in addressing the skills requirements of Industry 5.0. The results suggest that obtaining a comprehensive understanding of students' cognitive abilities is possible, and educational interventions can be adapted by combining neuropsychological approaches with EEG data collection. In the future, it is essential to refine these evaluation methods further and explore their applicability in different engineering disciplines. Additionally, it is necessary to investigate the long-term impact of these methods on workforce preparation and performance.","[Rueda-Castro, Valentina; Azofeifa, Jose Daniel; Caratozzolo, Patricia] Tecnol Monterrey, Inst Future Educ, Monterrey, Mexico; [Chacon, Julian; Caratozzolo, Patricia] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Caratozzolo, P (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Inst Future Educ, Monterrey, Mexico.;Caratozzolo, P (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City, Mexico.",pcaratozzolo@tec.mx,,"Azofeifa, Jose Daniel/0000-0002-6843-4863","Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico [I030-IFE002-C2-T1-E, N21-260]","Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of Writing Lab, the Challenge-Based Research Funding Program, Grant No. I030-IFE002-C2-T1-E and the NOVUS project N21-260 all three from the Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, in producing this work.",,115,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,,,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

Owing to the integration of the industrial automation strengths with the inimitable cognitive capabilities of humans, HRC is paramount to move towards advanced and sustainable production systems. Although the overall safety of collaborative robotics has increased over time, further research efforts are needed to allow humans to operate alongside robots, with awareness and trust. Numerous safety concerns are open, and either new or enhanced technical, procedural and organizational measures have to be investigated to design and implement inherently safe and ergonomic automation solutions, aligning the systems performance and the human safety. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis and a literature review are carried out in the present paper to provide a comprehensive overview of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) issues in HRC. As a result, the most researched topics and application areas, and the possible future lines of research are identified. Reviewed articles stress the central role played by humans during collaboration, underlining the need to integrate the human factor in the hazard analysis and risk assessment. Human-centered design and cognitive engineering principles also require further investigations to increase the worker acceptance and trust during collaboration. Deepened studies are compul-sory in the healthcare sector, to investigate the social and ethical implications of HRC.

A virtual driver model was created using the cognitive architecture. The model was simulated in the same situations as the human drivers.

This study presents an alternative measure with a substantial ecological validity. First, we developed a behavioural video coding scheme identifying 11 assembly behaviours potentially revealing MWL being too high. Subsequently, we explored its validity by analysing videos of 24 participants performing a high and a low complexity assembly. Results showed that five of the behaviours identified, such as freezing and the amount of part rotations, significantly differed in occurrence and/or duration between the two conditions. The study hereby proposes a novel and naturalistic method that could help practitioners to map and redesign critical assembly phases, and researchers to enrich validation of MWL-measures through measurement triangulation. Practitioner summary:Current physiological mental workload (MWL) measures still lack sufficient reliability when applied in the field. Therefore, we identified several observable assembly behaviours that could reveal MWL being too high.

Where the bare-hand gesture interface is considered a promising manner to manipulate the virtual assembly model, nevertheless, it usually suffers from unreliable recognition results and poor adaptability due to the unfamiliarity with gesture libraries in actual AR assembly tasks. In this paper, we try to establish a robust and easy-to-use natural bare-hand interactive AR assembly system, enabling the operator to interact against the ongoing virtual assembly models intuitively and resulting in a human-centric AR assembly performance. Firstly, a normalized feature information extraction for real-time bare-hand gestures is presented, which can establish a robust gesture model expression when encountering different sensing distances and varying operators. Followed by the definition of some typical bare-hand interaction functions related to manual assembly operations, and thus reliable interactions between hand gestures and virtual components are available. Then, a bare-hand-enabled interactive AR assembly system is established, where operators can explore and manipulate a large amount of assembly-related information with the help of real-time bare-hand interaction. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed bare-hand interactive AR assembly system, and results demonstrate that it can alleviate the cognitive load for the operators while providing a human-centric assembly performance.","[Fang, Wei; Teng, Zhan; Zhang, Qiankun; Wu, Zhaowei] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Automat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Wei] Fujian Special Equipment Inspection & Res Inst, Fujian Key Lab Special Intelligent Equipment Safet, Fuzhou, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Fang, W (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Automat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Fang, W (corresponding author), Fujian Special Equipment Inspection & Res Inst, Fujian Key Lab Special Intelligent Equipment Safet, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.",fangwei@bupt.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),No Statement Available,,52,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

The model to characterize and predict human error presented in this paper is linked conceptually to the model introduced by Rasch (1980), where the probability of a specified outcome is modelled as a logistic function of the difference between the person capacity and item difficulty. The model needs to be modified to take into account an outcome that is not dichotomous and feed into the interaction between two macro factors: (a) Task complexity: that summarises all factors contributing to physical and mental workload requirements for execution of a given operative task & (b) Human capability: that considered the skills, training and experience of the people facing the tasks, representing a synthesis of their physical and cognitive abilities to verify whether or not they are matching the task requirements. Task complexity can be evaluated as a mathematical construct considering the compound effects of Mental Workload Demands and Physical Workload Demands associated to an operator task. Similarly, operator capability can be estimated on the basis of the operators' set of cognitive capabilities and physical conditions. A linear regression model was used to fit a dataset collected in R. The estimation of task complexity and operator skills was used to estimate human performance in a Poisson regression model. The preliminary results suggest that both elements are significant in predicting error occurrence.","[Leva, M.

Many researchers are facing this innovative manufacturing system studying several aspects such as task allocation, facility layout problem and timing. Above all, one of the most important issues in collaborative robotics is the wellbeing of the operator collaborating with the robot system during the different phases of the process. The added value of a collaborative workplace respect to the manual and automatic workplaces is strictly correlated to a safe and ergonomic interaction between the operator and the robot. Indeed, the combination of robot and operator skills lead to a higher level of accuracy and flexibility. Thus, assessing operator's working conditions requires the acquisition, eventually in real time, of relevant parameters such as posture, movements, and interactive tasks. This may require the adoption of existing metrics proposed by standard evaluation guidelines, as well as the introduction of new or modified prescription to consider the presence of the robot. The ergonomics analysis in collaborative robotics is evaluated by considering both physical and cognitive aspects of the operator during the interaction with the robot. The research work aims to carry out a scientific bibliometric literature review (BLR) about the ergonomics analysis of collaborative workplaces, and to identify methods and tools for the physical and cognitive ergonomics assessment that can be adopted in collaborative robotics. The search has been accomplished using the Scopus database by means of a set of key words specifically defined to investigate the ergonomics in the collaborative robotics. The review provides a sharp classification, a critical analysis of the most relevant contributions in this field so that emerging trends for future development can be defined and discussed.","[Di Marino, Castrese; Vitali, Andrea; Regazzoni, Daniele] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Di Marino, Castrese; Tarallo, Andrea] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Naples Federico II,"Di Marino, C (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.;Di Marino, C (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.",,,,"Regione Lombardia, Italy [1175328]","Regione Lombardia, Italy(Regione Lombardia)","The authors want to thank the Regione Lombardia, Italy, which funded this research with the WATCHMAN project (ID 1175328).",,61,0,0,0,6,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-8560-4,,,,2021,,,,,,,,,V006T06A020,,,,,10,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BU1WR,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000883011100020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although cumulative evidence pointed out a positive impact of these visualization technologies on construction task performance, there is still an obvious disagreement on the benefits or implications of these new visualization technologies, due to the lack of understanding of the mechanisms in which the visualization affects cognitive processes related to information processing. To obtain more evidence, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 90) to investigate the impact of information format on the performance of an industrial pipeline maintenance task. The investigation centers around how different engineering information formats affect the attention patterns as a potential explanation for the changes in performance. A between-group experiment design was used where the participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups (2D group, 3D group, and VR group) depending on what type of information was given to review the pipe operation instruction. After the review session, the participants were asked to perform the operation task in the virtual environment based on their memory. The results showed that the 3D and VR groups outperformed the 2D group in task performance. The analysis of eye-tracking data further indicated that the information format significantly changed the gaze scanning pattern when participants were reviewing the operational instructions. We also found that the task performance was correlated with eye-tracking features including gaze movement and pupil dilation. Our findings provided more evidence about the mechanisms in which new visualization technologies affect the attention patterns, helped resolve the current disagreement within the literature. In addition, a prediction model was proposed to use eye-tracking features to predict construction task performance.","[Shi, Yangming; Du, Jing; Zhu, Qi] Univ Florida, Herbert Werthe Coll Engn, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm ESSIE, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Herbert Werthe Coll Engn, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm ESSIE, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",shiyangming@ufl.edu; eric.du@essie.ufl.edu; qizhu@ufl.edu,"Du, Jing/AHE-6199-2022; Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024; Shi, Yangming/AAT-8768-2021",,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [1937878]; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [60NANB18D152]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1937878] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)(National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","The authors would like to acknowledge Xin Liu and Baiyu Chen, students from Texas A&M University and City University of Hong Kong for facilitating the experiment.

Within this article, an analysis within production management identifies possible antecedent variables on trust in AI and evaluates these due to interaction scenarios with AI. The results of this research are five antecedents for human trust in AI within production management. From these results, preliminary design guidelines are derived for a socially sustainable human-AI interaction in future production management systems. Practitioner summary: In the future, artificial intelligence will assist cognitive tasks in production management. In order to make good decisions, humans trust in AI has to be well calibrated. For trustful human-AI interactions, it is beneficial that humans subjectively perceive AI as capable and comprehensible and that they themselves are digitally competent.","[Sassmannshausen, Till; Burggraef, Peter; Wagner, Johannes; Steinberg, Fabian] Univ Siegen, Int Prod Engn & Management, Siegen, Germany; [Hassenzahl, Marc] Univ Siegen, Ubiquitous Design, Siegen, Germany; [Heupel, Thomas] FOM Univ Appl Sci, Siegen, Germany",Universitat Siegen; Universitat Siegen,"Sassmannshausen, T (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Int Prod Engn & Management, Siegener Str 152, D-57223 Kreuztal, Germany.",till.sassmannshausen@uni-siegen.de,"Wagner, Johannes/P-2946-2019; Saßmannshausen, Till/AAG-1801-2020; Wagner, Johannes/K-6150-2016; Burggraf, Peter/H-6423-2016","Wagner, Johannes/0000-0002-3226-2457; Steinberg, Fabian/0000-0002-9842-5343; Burggraf, Peter/0000-0001-9018-9959; Sassmannshausen, Till Moritz/0000-0002-1061-8686",,,,,98,10,14,32,155,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0014-0139,1366-5847,,ERGONOMICS,Ergonomics,OCT 3,2021,64,10,,,,,1333,1350,,10.1080/00140139.2021.1909755,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2021.1909755,,MAY 2021,18,"Engineering, Industrial; Ergonomics; Psychology, Applied; Psychology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Psychology,UZ3KW,33939596,hybrid,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000646425600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Concerns about the introduction of new technology have been prevalent throughout history, and exploring public perceptions of these technologies can provide insight to help address such cultural anxieties. However, evaluating user perceptions of futuristic technology is difficult, requiring novel approaches to provide context and understanding. To explore users' perceptions of future DMTs, we applied the ContraVision technique in a questionnaire-based study. Participants viewed films, representing fictionalized utopic and dystopic visions of what the future of these DMTs might involve, and a questionnaire probed the perceptions of the technologies afterward. Findings showed that irrespective of the way technology was portrayed, participants had concerns about the ethical and responsible implementation of these tools. Participant responses were analyzed to identify key challenges for policy surrounding DMT implementation in the future of manufacturing.","[Marinescu, Adrian; Argyle, Elizabeth M.; Duvnjak, Joshua; Lawson, Glyn; Sharples, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Human Factors Res Grp, Nottingham NG7 2RD, Notts, England; [Wilson, Max L.] Univ Nottingham, Mixed Real Lab, Nottingham, England; [Hubbard, Ella-Mae; Justham, Laura] Loughborough Univ, Human Factors Engn Res Grp, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; Loughborough University,"Argyle, EM; Lawson, G (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Human Factors Res Grp, Nottingham NG7 2RD, Notts, England.",elizabeth.argyle@nottingham.ac.uk; glyn.lawson@nottingham.ac.uk,"Wilson, Max/AAH-8739-2021; Hubbard, Ella-Mae/I-4291-2014; Justham, Laura/G-5254-2013","Duvnjak, Joshua/0000-0002-3330-4276; Justham, Laura/0000-0003-1052-1873; Wilson, Max/0000-0002-3515-6633; Hubbard, Ella-Mae/0000-0003-4022-3738",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; EPSRC [EP/R032718/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,,58,3,3,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-8471,1520-6564,,HUM FACTOR ERGON MAN,Hum.

Nonetheless, Industry 5.0 will inevitably face the great challenges such as large scale connectivity and explosive data traffic because of the proliferation of IoT devices. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based overlay cognitive radio (OCR) network for Industry 5.0. Specifically, the hybrid full-duplex (FD)/ half-duplex (HD) mode at the secondary user (SR) is adopted and in-phase and quadrature phase imbalance (IQI) is introduced to better comply with the practical scenarios. We investigate the outage probability (OP) and ergodic sum rate (ESR) of the considered network with the Nakagami-m channels. Extensive simulation experiments are performed to verify the accuracy of the analysis. From the simulation results, we can conclude: i) Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), OP decreases but ESR increases and tends to a fixed value at high SNR regimes, indicating that the existence of IQI leads to a ceiling for the ESR; ii) The primary system has higher reliable performance at low SNR regions when SR is in FD mode, and for ergodicity, the system with FD relay is superior to HD relay; iii) The reliable performance of OMA system for primary users will be better since there is no interference at the relay.& COPY; 2022 The Author(s).

We propose a classification of collaboration levels for Human-Robot collaboration (HRC) in manufacturing that we call levels of collaboration (LoC), formed to provide a conceptual model conducive to the design of assembly lines incorporating HRC. This paper aims to provide a more theoretical foundation for such a tool based on relevant theories from cognitive science and other perspectives of human-technology interaction, strengthening the validity and scientific rigour of the envisioned LoC tool. The main contributions consist of a theoretical grounding to motivate the transition from automation to collaboration, which are intended to facilitate expanding the LoC classification to support HRC, as well as an initial visualization of the LoC approach. Future work includes fully defining the LoC classification as well as operationalizing functionally different cooperation types. We conclude that collaboration is a means to an end, so collaboration is not entered for its own sake, and that collaboration differs fundamentally from more commonly used views where automation is the focus.","[Kolbeinsson, Ari] Univ Skovde, Sch Engn, Skovde, Sweden; [Lagerstedt, Erik; Lindblom, Jessica] Univ Skovde, Sch Informat, Skovde, Sweden",University of Skovde; University of Skovde,"Kolbeinsson, A (corresponding author), Univ Skovde, Sch Engn, Skovde, Sweden.",ari.kolbeinsson@his.se,"Lindblom, Jessica/GWD-0497-2022; Lagerstedt, Erik/JEO-6954-2023","Lagerstedt, Erik/0000-0002-8937-8063; Kolbeinsson, Ari/0000-0003-2627-0079; Lindblom, Jessica/0000-0003-0946-7531","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [637107, 723711]; Stiftelsen for Kunskaps-och Kompetensutveckling [20140220]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [637107] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(Horizon 2020); Stiftelsen for Kunskaps-och Kompetensutveckling; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This work was supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [637107,723711]; Stiftelsen for Kunskaps-och Kompetensutveckling [20140220].",,58,47,50,2,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2169-3277,,PROD MANUF RES,Prod.

To enhance the collaboration between CPS and human workers new forms of bidirectional interaction have to be setup and evaluated. In this paper, we analyzed the interaction methods of an automated transport vehicle (ATV). The ATV can be controlled via app on smartphones or tablets, gesture recognition using sensor wristbands or speech control. To obtain information about which interaction possibility should be used we have conducted a case study in which users had to control the ATV by all three modalities. During the evaluation, we examined the feedback of the user on the Likert-scale as well as objectionable information like task fulfillment time and error rate.

Next, the holistic manufacturing scene is perceived by visual sensors as a temporal graph. Then, a collaborative mode with similar instructions can be inferred by graph embedding. Lastly, mutual-cognitive decisions are immersed into the Augmented Reality execution loop for intuitive HRC support. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of CIRP.

The RGB-D sensor is thereby placed at the ceiling and observes a shared workspace for human-robot collaboration in the industrial domain. The pixelwise information about certain body parts of the human worker is used by a cognitive system for the optimization of interaction and collaboration processes. In this context, for rational decision making and planning, the pixelwise predictions must be reliable despite the high variability of the appearance of the human worker. In our approach we treat the problem as a pixelwise classification task, where we train a random decision forest classifier on the information contained in depth frames produced by a synthetic representation of the human body and the ceiling sensor, in a virtual environment. As shown in similar approaches, the samples used for training need to cover a broad spectrum of the geometrical characteristics of the human, and possible transformations of the body in the scene. In order to reduce the number of training samples and the complexity of the classifier training, we therefore apply an elaborated and coupled strategy for randomized training data sampling and feature extraction. This allows us to reduce the training set size and training time, by decreasing the dimensionality of the sampling parameter space. In order to keep the creation of synthetic training samples and real-world ground truth data simple, we use a highly reduced virtual representation of the human body, in combination with KINECT skeleton tracking data from a calibrated multi-sensor setup. The optimized training and simplified sample creation allows us to deploy standard hardware for the realization of the presented approach, while yielding a reliable segmentation in real-time, and high performance scores in the evaluation.","[Dittrich, Frank; Woern, Heinz] Karlsruher Inst Technol, Inst Proc Control & Robot, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Sharma, Vivek; Yayilgan, Stile] Gjovik Univ Coll, Fac Comp Sci & Media Technol, Gjovik, Norway",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Dittrich, F (corresponding author), Karlsruher Inst Technol, Inst Proc Control & Robot, Karlsruhe, Germany.",frank.dittrich@kit.edu; woern@kit.edu; vivek.sharma@hig.no; sule.yayilgan@hig.no,"YILDIRIM-YAYILGAN, SULE/H-6700-2018","YILDIRIM-YAYILGAN, SULE/0000-0002-1982-6609",,,,,12,5,7,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4799-3486-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,388,394,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BD5JD,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000361490700075,View Full Record in Web of Science

Background: As maritime operations move into Arctic and Antarctic environments, decision makers must be able to recognize how cold weather affects human performance and subsequently adjusts management and operational tools and strategies. Method: In the present work, a revised version of the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) methodology has been developed to assess the effects of cold on the likelihood of human error in offshore oil and gas facilities. This methodology has been applied to post-maintenance tasks of offshore oil and gas facility pumps to investigate how management, operational, and equipment issues must be considered in risk analysis and prediction of human error in cold environments. Results: This paper provides a proof of concept indicating that the risk associated with operations in cold environments is greater than the risk associated with the same operations performed in temperate climates. It also develops guidelines regarding how this risk can be assessed. The results illustrate that in post-maintenance procedures of a pump, the risk value related to the effect of cold and harsh environments on operator cognitive performance is twice as high as the risk value when performed in normal conditions. Conclusion: The present work demonstrates significant differences between human error probabilities (HEPs) and associated risks in normal conditions as opposed to cold and harsh environments. This study also highlights that the cognitive performance of the human operator is the most important factor affected by the cold and harsh conditions. Application: The methodology developed in this paper can be used for reevaluating the HEPs for particular scenarios that occur in harsh environments since these HEPs may not be comparable to similar scenarios in normal conditions.","[Noroozi, Alireza; Khan, Faisal; Khakzad, Nima] Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada; [Abbassi, Rouzbeh] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [MacKinnon, Scott] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Sch Human Kinet, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; Princeton University; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Khan, F (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Safety & Risk Engn Grp, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada.",fikhan@mun.ca,"Khan, Faisal/AAO-6293-2020; Abbassi, Rouzbeh/AAA-2051-2020; Abbassi, Rouzbeh/N-4077-2017","Abbassi, Rouzbeh/0000-0002-9230-6175; Khakzad, Nima/0000-0002-3899-6830",,,,,38,41,43,1,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Our work contributes a preliminary characterization of TWS and empirical evidence that this term can capture a more holistic notion of work that also includes the worker's feelings and well-being.","[Guillou, Hayley; Chow, Kevin; McGrenere, Joanna] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Fritz, Thomas] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of British Columbia; University of Zurich,"Guillou, H (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",guillouh@cs.ubc.ca; kchowk@cs.ubc.ca; fritz@ifi.uzh.ch; joanna@cs.ubc.ca,"Fritz, Thomas/KZK-7653-2024","Chow, Kevin/0009-0008-5455-3328",NSERC Highly Personalized User Interfaces [RGPIN-2017-04549]; ABB Industrial Research Grant [F17-05273-22R77358]; NSERC [CRDPJ 530226-18],NSERC Highly Personalized User Interfaces; ABB Industrial Research Grant; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We are grateful for funding from NSERC Highly Personalized User Interfaces (RGPIN-2017-04549), ABB Industrial Research Grant F17-05273-22R77358, and NSERC CRDPJ 530226-18.

However, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has not been embraced yet. Industry 4.0 imposes several challenges which include the necessity of new architectural models to tackle the uncertainty that open environments represent to cyber-physical systems (CPS). Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling plants stand for one of such open environments. Here, CPSs must work harmoniously in a changing environment, interacting with similar and not so similar CPSs, and adaptively collaborating with human workers. In this paper, we support the Distributed Adaptive Control (DAC) theory as a suitable Cognitive Architecture for managing a recycling plant. Specifically, a recursive implementation of DAC (between both single-agent and large-scale levels) is proposed to meet the expected demands of the European Project HR-Recycler. Additionally, with the aim of having a realistic benchmark for future implementations of the recursive DAC, a micro-recycling plant prototype is presented.","[Guerrero Rosado, Oscar; Verschure, Paul F.

These limitations have reduced current control approaches to estimation techniques based on correlated metrics, such as electromyographic (EMG) signals. The current study investigates a parameter known to represent the nullspace of the mapping from muscle forces to joint torques in the human musculoskeletal system, i.e., muscle co-activation. It is hypothesized that this parameter is a random variable that correlates with muscle activities, measured through EMG signals. A change in this variable directly affects endpoint stiffness, and therefore system performance and stability. This study additionally presents a methodology for processing EMG (cocontraction) data prior to training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, meant to be used as a decision tool for haptic impedance control. Results presented serve as a springboard for the incorporation of a human operator model suitable for real-time implementation and sufficient to support bilateral human-robot interaction. The long-term goals of this research are to understand the mechanisms governing neuromotor adaptation in pHRI, and ultimately design a novel haptic device that tunes its impedance gains in conjunction with changes in an operator's physical and cognitive state. Such implementation would improve the efficacy of robot co-workers operated in industrial settings, among other applications.","[Moualeu, Antonio; Gallagher, William; Ueda, Jun] Georgia Inst Technol, Biorobot & Human Modeling Lab, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Moualeu, A (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Biorobot & Human Modeling Lab, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",amoualeu3@mail.gatech.edu; bgallagher@gatech.edu; jun.ueda@me.gatech.edu,"Ueda, Jun/AAX-9704-2020",,,,,,35,6,6,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-0858,,978-1-4799-6934-0,IEEE INT C INT ROBOT,,,2014,,,,,,,2154,2159,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BC0YL,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000349834602041,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, an anthropomorphic robot with affect display ability is used to collaborate with its human partner so that they can collaboratively assemble several parts to manufacture a finished product. Firstly, in order to receive bioinspiration, the affective features in a similar human-human collaborative assembly task arc investigated. Secondly, based on the human's affective features, the affect dynamics (the computational model of affect) for the robot is derived for the collaborative assembly task. Thirdly, based on the affect model, an affect-based intelligent motion planning strategy for the robot is developed so that the robot can dynamically adjust its affective states like a human with changes in the assembly task situations during the human-robot collaborative assembly task to make the assembly situations transparent to the human. Finally, the potential impacts of the proposed bio-inspired dynamic affect-based robot motion planning on human-robot interaction and manufacturing performance are discussed.","[Rahman, S. M.

The cognitive overload driven by an excess of complex information has become a potential issue. Nonetheless, standardized information systems are still widely used, despite individual differences in information intake. To set a foundation for the intelligent information systems of smart cities, this paper introduces methods and tools for a cognition-driven, personalized information system, which acknowledges individual differences in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in daily lives and at work. The proposed method includes the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate complex tasks paired with the digital twin modeling of workers' cognitive reactions to different information formats and contents in VR simulation. Collected data are then used to build a personal digital twins model of information-driven cognition, or Cog-DT. A human subject experiment was performed with a simulated industrial facility shutdown maintenance task as a proof of concept of Cog-DT. The latest neuroimaging technology and analysis methods were applied to model unique cognitive processes pertaining to information processing. Results indicate that cognitive activities driven by different information stimuli in the work context are distinguishable and modelable with Cog-DT methods and tools. This study is expected to contribute to digital twin literature by testing a human-centered, individual-level digital twin modeling method of cognitive activities. It also sets a preliminary foundation for developing personalized information systems for the smart cities of the future.","[Du, Jing; Zhu, Qi; Shi, Yangming] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd,460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wang, Qi] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lin, Yingzi] Northeastern Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zhao, Daniel] Eastside High Sch, Gainesville, FL 32641 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Northeastern University; Northeastern University,"Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd,460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",eric.du@essie.ufl.edu; qizhu@ufl.edu; shiyangming@ufl.ediu; q.wang@northeastern.edu; yi.lin@northeastern.edu; dzhao@gm.sbac.edu,"Shi, Yangming/AAT-8768-2021; Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024; Du, Jing/AHE-6199-2022",,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [1761459, 1761950]; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [60NANB18D152]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1761459, 1761950] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)(National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This material is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant Nos. 1761459 and 1761950, as well as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under Grant No. 60NANB18D152.

How to systematically, purposefully and reasonably interact with human beings and make-decision accordingly is one of the key factors for exerting the potential of cognitive computing and providing services for human beings. As one of the crucial supporting technologies for industrial equipment health management, bearing health analysis has increasingly become an important research field that is promising to improve the reliability and efficiency of modern industrial systems. One of the main challenges in condition-based maintenance and management of bearing is the health quantitative modeling and assessment. Therefore, a learning-based health modeling method, on the basis of newly defined multidimensional frequency-domain health feature, is proposed to realize quantitative assessment of bearing health state. First, a multilayer neural network with a special structure is designed. Then, a novel algorithm, namely PAirwiSe CompArison Learning (PASCAL) is proposed for network parameters learning. In addition, experiments are designed and carried out on a real industrial bearing testing dataset to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed health modeling method. Experimental results are compared with those of two others recent research works, and the performance is measured with a percentage error metric. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The study analyses the student audience who uses software tools differently from the basis. In the research, two languages supporting UI implementation related to .NET technology, XAML and classic C#, were compared in terms of the cognitive load of test subjects. The results of the traditional knowledge level assessment tests and the answers to the questionnaires show that the UI implementation described in XAML is easier to read and understand than the same description in classic C#. When viewing the source codes, the eye movement parameters of the test subjects were also recorded and then evaluated, where a significant difference in the number and duration of fixations was observed, i.e., the interpretation of the classic C# source code showed a larger cognitive load. Overall, the results of the eye movement parameters supported the results of the other two measurement methods when comparing the different types of UI descriptions.

Given that human behavior is directed by cognition, researchers have proposed various cognitive models of human behavior in order to provide a clearer understanding of how to allocate management resources. However, the influence of human cognition on behavior remains an overarching concept, rather than providing an understanding of the heterogeneity among various trades. Therefore, cognition research provides no guidance regarding how to strategically allocate management resources such as training. This study employed structural equation modeling to identify the cognitive structures of two trades (reinforcing steel bar and elevator workers). We find that the cognitive structures of workers in these sample trades are significantly different, indicating that management strategies should vary accordingly. Training of mechanical workers should focus on crew leads, who can further influence self-efficacy, risk comparisons, and workers' perception of external conditions. For rebar crews, safety training should focus on self-supporting defense capability and elucidating dangerous behaviors. External conditions have a significant role in ensuring worker safety; safe facilities engender safe behaviors. This study lays a foundation of strategic resource allocation for behavioral management on construction jobsites.","[Liao, Pin-Chao; Wang, Yanqing; Wang, Xiaoyun; Ganbat, Tsenguun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bingsheng] Tianjing Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tianjin University,"Liu, BS (corresponding author), Tianjing Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",pinchaoliao@tsinghua.edu.cn; liubingsheng@tju.edu.cn; 438183695@qq.com; wangxy_wz@163.com; melody_tsenguun@yahoo.com,"wang, yanqing/C-5680-2014; Wang, Xiaoyun/AGX-8190-2022; Liao, Pin-Chao/Z-3750-2019","Ganbat, Tsenguun/0000-0001-8982-6121",United Technology Center,United Technology Center,"This research was funded by the United Technology Center.

Understanding this development is an essential aspect of understanding the human mind and may facilitate the construction of artificial minds with similar properties. Importantly, human cognitive development relies on embodied interactions with the physical and social environment, which is perceived via complementary sensory modalities. These interactions allow the developing mind to probe the causal structure of the world. This is in stark contrast to common machine learning approaches, e.g., for large language models, which are merely passively digesting large amounts of training data, but are not in control of their sensory inputs. However, computational modeling of the kind of self-determined embodied interactions that lead to human intelligence and consciousness is a formidable challenge. Here, we present Multimodal Infant Model (MiMo), an open-source multimodal infant model for studying early cognitive development through computer simulations. MIMo's body is modeled after an 18-month-old child with detailed five-fingered hands. MIMo perceives its surroundings via binocular vision, a vestibular system, proprioception, and touch perception through a full-body virtual skin, while two different actuation models allow control of his body. We describe the design and interfaces of MIMo and provide examples illustrating its use.","[Mattern, Dominik] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Comp Sci & Math, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schumacher, Pierre] Max Planck Inst Intelligent Syst, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Schumacher, Pierre] Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Lopez, Francisco M.; Raabe, Marcel C.; Ernst, Markus R.; Aubret, Arthur; Triesch, Jochen] Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Max Planck Society; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University Hospital,"Mattern, D (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Comp Sci & Math, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.;Triesch, J (corresponding author), Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies, Frankfurt, Germany.",domattee@yahoo.de; triesch@fias.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Ernst, Markus Roland/0000-0002-2800-6346","Adaptive Mind; Third Wave of Artificial Intelligence through the Excellence Program of the Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Art; Johanna Quandt foundation; International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)","Adaptive Mind; Third Wave of Artificial Intelligence through the Excellence Program of the Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Art; Johanna Quandt foundation; International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)","This work was supported by The Adaptive Mindand The Third Wave of Artificial Intelligence through the Excellence Program of the Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Art.

Repeated measures correlation analyses of daily fatigue data from seventy offshore workers revealed that while total sleep time remained unaffected by time on rig, workers' performances on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) deteriorated over time across all shift types.

However, worker fatigue is barely considered in DRCFJSP, which will result in unsuitable task assignments for workers and bring about negative effects such as muscle fatigue and cognitive confusion. To this end, a fatigue-conscious DRCFJSP is proposed in this paper, aiming at simultaneously relieving fatigue and promoting productivity by joint scheduling of machines and workers. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to minimize the maximum worker fatigue and makespan. Furthermore, an enhanced NSGA-II (ENSGA) is developed in this paper to cope with the proposed problem. In the ENSGA, four dispatch rules are designed to generate high-quality solutions at the initialization stage.

As robots become more common and useful not only in industry but also in the home, they will need to interact with humans to complete many varied tasks. Previous studies have demonstrated that autonomous robots are often more efficient and preferred over those that need to be commanded, or those that give instructions to humans. We believe that the types of actions that make up a task affect the preference of participants for different interaction styles. In this work, our goal is to explore tasks with different action types together with different interaction styles to find the specific situations in which different interaction styles are preferred. We have identified several classifications for table-top tasks and have developed a set of tasks that vary along two of these dimensions together with a set of different interaction styles that the robot can use to choose actions. We report on results from a series of human-robot interaction studies involving a PR2 completing table-top tasks with a human. The results suggest that people prefer robot-led interactions for tasks with a higher cognitive load and human-led interactions for joint actions.","[Schulz, Ruth; Kratzer, Philipp; Toussaint, Marc] Stuttgart Univ, Inst Parallele & Verteilte Syst, Machine Learning & Robot Lab, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart,"Schulz, R (corresponding author), Stuttgart Univ, Inst Parallele & Verteilte Syst, Machine Learning & Robot Lab, Stuttgart, Germany.",ruth.schulz@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de,,"Toussaint, Marc/0000-0002-5487-6767",International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS),International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS),We thank the volunteers who participated in the study.

Operators' error in cloud change activities is a leading factor for cloud incidents, which have received relatively less attention in cloud security research. This study conducted a two-stage research process using an integrated approach to explore the stable individual factors related to cloud change errors. First, in the qualitative research, content analysis based on interviews and historical documents was conducted to extract the operator's cognitive abilities and personality traits and develop hypotheses. Five cognitive abilities and six personality traits were extracted. Second, quantitative research based on an experiment was conducted to test relationships between operators' different types of cloud change errors and 1) cognitive ability and 2) personality traits, respectively. Results of error type comparisons suggested that operators generated more uncorrected errors than corrected errors and more operational errors than omission errors in cloud change activities. The multivariate Poisson regression analysis suggested that cognitive abilities of sustained attention, divided attention, and long-term memory negatively predicted the number of operators' total errors, uncorrected errors, and operational errors. Regarding personality traits, with the increase in resilience capacity and carefulness and the decrease in self-esteem, the number of different types of errors reduced, except for omission errors. Working memory and risk-taking propensity were also significant predictors of the number of uncorrected errors with negative and positive coefficients, respectively. Logical reasoning, emotional stability, and sense of responsibility were not observed as predictors of cloud change errors. The present findings have several implications for the industry and cloud providers to enhance industrial cloud data security regarding human cognitive abilities and personality traits.","[Zhang, Wei; Wu, Changxu; Peng, Shuo] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 30 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jiahao] Huawei Technol, Huawei Sakata Base, Shenzhen 518129, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Huawei Technologies,"Wu, CX (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 30 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",changxu.wu@gmail.com,"Yu, Jiahao/HPG-6396-2023; Peng, Shuo/IVH-7866-2023",,,,,,126,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-8141,1872-8219,,INT J IND ERGONOM,Int.

Training enhances the operator's understanding of the process, which is then encapsulated as mental models. Typically, the operator's learning in traditional training programs is assessed using expert judgment or in terms of process-and operator action-based metrics. These assessment schemes, however, ignore the cognitive aspects of learning, such as mental model development and cognitive workload. The HMM-based model proposed in Part 1 offers a systematic way to quantify operators' cognition during abnormalities. In this Part 2, we show that the cognitive behaviors displayed by expert operators can be represented as target values on the HMM's state transitions and emission probability distributions. Further, we propose two axioms of learning that can capture the evolution of the operator's mental models as they learn the causal relationships in the process and gain expertise in handling abnormal situations. We validate the proposed axioms by conducting training experiments involving 10 participants performing 486 tasks. Our results reveal that the axioms can accurately assess the progress of operators' learning.","[Shahab, Mohammed Aatif; Srinivasan, Babji] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Appl Mech, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Iqbal, Mohd Umair] Indian Inst Technol Gandhinagar, Dept Chem Engn, Gandhinagar 382355, India; [Srinivasan, Rajagopalan] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Chem Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Srinivasan, Babji; Srinivasan, Rajagopalan] Indian Inst Technol Madras, American Express Lab Data Analyt Risk & Technol, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Srinivasan, B (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Appl Mech, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.;Srinivasan, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Chem Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",babji.srinivasan@iitm.ac.in; raj@iitm.ac.in,"Shahab, Mohammed Aatif/HMD-6035-2023; Srinivasan, Rajagopalan/B-5322-2010","Shahab, Mohammed Aatif/0000-0001-5398-4638; Srinivasan, Rajagopalan/0000-0002-8790-4349","American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600036, India; [600036]","American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600036, India;","This work is partially funded by the American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600036, India.",,53,6,7,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-4230,1873-3352,,J LOSS PREVENT PROC,J.

Unlike many studies, the authors consider heterogeneous operators with dynamic performance factor that is impacted by the assignment and scheduling decisions. The purpose is to derive an understanding of the underlying effects of job rotations on performance metrics in a lean cell. The authors use an optimization framework and an experimental design methodology for sensitivity analysis of the input parameters. Design/methodology/approach The approach is an integration of three stages. The authors propose a set-based optimization model that considers human behavior parameters. They also solve the problem with two meta-heuristic algorithms and an efficient local search algorithm. Further, the authors run a post-optimality analysis by conducting a design of experiments using the response surface methodology (RSM). Findings The results of the optimization model reveal that the job rotation schedules and the human cognitive metrics influence the performance of the lean cell. The results of the sensitivity analysis further show that the objective function and the job rotation frequencies are highly sensitive to the other input parameters. Based on the findings from the RSM, the authors derive general rules for the job rotations in a lean cell given the ranges in other input variables. Originality/value The authors integrate the job rotation scheduling model with human behavioral and cognitive parameters and formulate the problem in a lean cell for the first time in the literature. In addition, they use the RSM for the first time in this context and offer a post-optimality analysis that reveals important information about the impact of the job rotations on the performance of operators and the entire working cell.","[Ayough, Ashkan; Zandieh, Mostafa] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Management & Accounting Fac, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Farhadi, Farbod] Roger Williams Univ, Bristol, RI 02809 USA",Shahid Beheshti University,"Ayough, A (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Management & Accounting Fac, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran.",a_ayough@sbu.ac.ir; ffarhadi@rwu.edu; m_zandieh@sbu.ac.ir,"Ayough, Ashkan/AAW-9248-2021; Zandieh, Mostafa/A-9651-2019","Zandieh, Mostafa/0000-0003-1209-9514; ayough, ashkan/0000-0001-7706-2101",,,,,67,2,2,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-5154,1758-4078,,ASSEMBLY AUTOM,Assem.

Yet, the collaboration between humans and robots is severely limited by the aspects of the safety and comfort of human operators. In this paper, we outline the use of extended reality (XR) as a way to test and develop collaboration with robots. We focus on virtual reality (VR) in simulating collaboration scenarios and the use of cobot digital twins. This is specifically useful in situations that are difficult or even impossible to safely test in real life, such as dangerous scenarios. We describe using XR simulations as a means to evaluate collaboration with robots without putting humans at harm. We show how an XR setting enables combining human behavioral data, subjective self-reports, and biosignals signifying human comfort, stress and cognitive load during collaboration. Several works demonstrate XR can be used to train human operators and provide them with augmented reality (AR) interfaces to enhance their performance with robots. We also provide a first attempt at what could become the basis for a human-robot collaboration testing framework, specifically for designing and testing factors affecting human-robot collaboration. The use of XR has the potential to change the way we design and test cobots, and train cobot operators, in a range of applications: from industry, through healthcare, to space operations.","[Bermudez i Badia, Sergi; Branco, Diogo] Univ Madeira, Nova Lincs, FCEE, P-9020105 Funchal, Portugal; [Silva, Paula Alexandra] Univ Coimbra, CISUC, DEI, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Pinto, Ana] Univ Coimbra, CeBER, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Carvalho, Carla; Almeida, Jorge; Pilacinski, Artur] Univ Coimbra, CINEICC, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Menezes, Paulo] Univ Coimbra, DEEC, ISR, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Pilacinski, Artur] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Hosp Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum GmbH, Fac Med, Dept Neurosurg, D-44892 Bochum, Germany",Universidade da Madeira; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Ruhr University Bochum,"Pilacinski, A (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, CINEICC, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal.;Pilacinski, A (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Hosp Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum GmbH, Fac Med, Dept Neurosurg, D-44892 Bochum, Germany.",sergi.bermudez@uma.pt; paulasilva@dei.uc.pt; diogo.branco@arditi.pt; ana.pinto@dem.uc.pt; ccarvalho@fpce.uc.pt; paulomenezes@isr.uc.pt; jorgealmeida@fpce.uc.pt; ap@uc.pt,"Pinto, Ana/AAT-5568-2021; Pilacinski, Artur/LHA-0441-2024; Branco, Diogo/HHD-2092-2022; Carvalho, Carla/AAT-3945-2021; Silva, Paula Alexandra/N-5939-2014; Bermudez i Badia, Sergi/C-8681-2018; Menezes, Paulo/A-3121-2011","Carvalho, Carla/0000-0003-3351-5003; Pinto, Ana/0000-0002-8280-9887; Silva, Paula Alexandra/0000-0003-1573-7446; Bermudez i Badia, Sergi/0000-0003-4452-0414; Branco, Diogo/0000-0002-6269-6192; Pilacinski, Artur/0000-0002-3816-4372; Almeida, Jorge/0000-0002-6302-7564; Menezes, Paulo/0000-0002-4903-3554","University of Coimbra; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/MHC-PCN/6805/2014, 2021.05646.BD]; NOVA-LINCS [PEest/UID/CEC/04516/2019]; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/05037/2020]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [802553]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/MHC-PCN/6805/2014, 2021.05646.BD] Funding Source: FCT",University of Coimbra; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); NOVA-LINCS; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),University of Coimbra: Sementes 2020 (A.P.

The planning and control of such smart manufacturing systems necessitates several instances of human decision-making. The latest research at the nexus of operations management and psychology reveals that human decision-making in such fast-paced, dynamic and complex environments is often biased, resulting in suboptimal operational performance. Human-centered design of planning and control processes can mitigate biased decisions, thus boosting performance in smart manufacturing systems. Current research is silent about the impact and mitigation of cognitive biases in operations management, though. We intend to close this research gap. We combine systematic reviews of literature on behavioral operations management and cognitive biases in operations management, particularly in production planning and control with an in-depth case study based on 12 expert interviews. We explore two decision-making models and combine them in a PPC framework. We create a framework for human-centered PPC in smart manufacturing systems, which includes the main impact factors, challenges and performance capabilities.

This work presents a cognitive architecture composed of perception and reasoning modules that allows a robot to adapt its actions while collaborating with humans in an assembly task. Human action recognition perception is performed using convolutional neural network models with inertial measurement unit and skeleton tracking data. The action predictions are used for task status reasoning which predicts the time left for each action in a task allowing a robot to plan future actions. The task status reasoning uses a recurrent neural network method which is developed for transferability to new actions and tasks. Updateable input parameters allowing the system to optimise for each user and task with each trial performed are also investigated. Finally, the complete system is demonstrated with the collaborative assembly of a small chair and wooden box, along with a solo robot task of stacking objects performed when it would otherwise be idle. The human actions recognised are using a screw driver, Allen key, hammer and hand screwing, with online accuracies between 83-92%. User trials demonstrate the robot deciding when to start collaborative actions in order to synchronise with the user, as well as deciding when it has time to complete an action on its solo task before a collaborative action is required.","[Male, James; Martinez-Hernandez, Uriel] Univ Bath, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, England",University of Bath,"Male, J (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Bath BA2 7AY, England.",jjm53@bath.ac.uk; U.Martinez@bath.ac.uk,,"Martinez-Hernandez, Uriel/0000-0002-9922-7912; Fant-Male, James/0000-0003-3587-7593",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for the project Perception, reasoning and action planning for human-robot collaboration using machine-learning methods ' (EPSRC-ENG-DTA) .",,50,9,9,9,44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

In current research in the field of production logistics the impact of cognitive biases on the decision-making process in PPC remains at a silent place.

Examples include the aerospace industry where the fitting of pipes and wiring into confined spaces in aircraft wings is still a manual operation. In these environments, workers are subjected to ergonomically awkward forces and postures for long periods of time. This leads to musculoskeletal injuries that severely limit the output of a shopfloor leading to loss of productivity. The use of tools such as wearable sensors could provide a way to track the ergonomics of workers in real time. However, an information processing architecture is required in order to ensure that data is processed in real time and in a manner that meaningful action points are retrieved for use by workers. In this work, based on the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive framework, we propose a Cognitive Architecture for Wearable Sensors (CAWES); a wearable sensor system and cognitive architecture that is capable of taking data streams from multiple wearable sensors on a worker's body and fusing them to enable digitisation, tracking and analysis of human ergonomics in real time on a shopfloor. Furthermore, through tactile feedback, the architecture is able to inform workers in real time when ergonomics rules are broken. The architecture is validated through the use of an aerospace case study undertaken in laboratory conditions. The results from the validation are encouraging and in the future, further tests will be performed in an actual working environment.","[Oyekan, J.; Chen, Y.; Tiwari, A.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Automat Control & Syst Engn, Amy Johnson Bldg,Portobello St, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Turner, C.] Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Rik Medlik Bldg, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Sheffield; University of Surrey,"Turner, C (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Rik Medlik Bldg, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",christopher.turner@surrey.ac.uk,"Tiwari, Ashutosh/A-9901-2011; Oyekan, John/AAN-4868-2020","Turner, Christopher/0000-0003-2812-3312",,,,,46,15,16,8,43,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

However, the relationship between the im-plantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D recon-struction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably.","[Wang, Zhuo; Li, Liang; Zhou, Yiliang; Lu, Zexin; Liu, Chaoqian; Su, Zekun] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Dai, Yuwei] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Architecture, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhuo; Zhang, Xiangyu; Bai, Xiaoliang; Billinghurst, Mark] Cyber Real Innovat Ctr China, Nanjing 211200, Peoples R China; [Billinghurst, Mark] Univ Auckland, Auckland Bioengn Inst, 70 Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; University of Auckland,"Dai, YW (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Architecture, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.",ywdai_usst@163.com,"Wang, Zhuo/AAR-9208-2020; Billinghurst, Mark/AAJ-4236-2020","Wang, Zhuo/0000-0002-4582-3401; Billinghurst, Mark/0000-0003-4172-6759",Foundation of China [52205534]; 2023 Shanghai Higher Education Young Teacher Training Support Program Project; 2023 China's Ministry of Education Collaborative Education Project between Industry and Education,Foundation of China; 2023 Shanghai Higher Education Young Teacher Training Support Program Project; 2023 China's Ministry of Education Collaborative Education Project between Industry and Education,"This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.52205534), 2023 Shanghai Higher Education Young Teacher Training Support Program Project(No.10-23-304-XXX), 2023 China's Ministry of Education Collaborative Education Project between Industry and Education.r Foundation of China (No.52205534) , 2023 Shanghai Higher Education Young Teacher Training Support Program Project (No.10-23-304-XXX) , 2023 China's Ministry of Education Collaborative Education Project between Industry and Education.",,59,1,1,5,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-0346,1873-5320,,ADV ENG INFORM,Adv.

A novel design approach consists of the introduction in the VE of Positive Computing to improve workers' well-being by applying the Biophilia hypothesis. In this work, we explored the possibility of introducing biophilic elements in a VE training scenario that would support psychological well-being and human potential. However, the introduction of virtual elements not related to the training task may distract operators, impairing their performance. We selected as a training scenario the assembly of a real truck engine. It is accomplished in a workstation, and operators do not interact with the surrounding VE. Therefore, we placed the training area into four different types of VEs: 3D Minimal (MIN), 3D Minimal Biophilic enriched (MIN+BIO), 3D Realistic (REAL), and 3D Realistic Biophilic enriched (REAL+BIO). We compared the MIN and REAL scenarios with the respective biophilic enriched scenarios. The performance of 40 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, object fixation time, training task accuracy, knowledge accuracy, cognitive load, and user experience. The results revealed that introducing biophilic elements in a VR training environment attracts users' attention in the idle phase of the training.

Especially in industrial environments, a strong level of interaction is reached when humans and robots form a dynamic system that works together towards achieving a common goal or accomplishing a task. However, the human-robot collaboration can be cognitively demanding, potentially contributing to cognitive fatigue. Therefore, the consideration of cognitive fatigue becomes particularly important to ensure the efficiency and safety in the overall human-robot collaboration. Additionally, sex is an inevitable human factor that needs further investigation for machine learning model development given the perceptual and physiological differences between the sexes in responding to fatigue. As such, this study explored sex differences and labeling strategies in the development of machine learning models for cognitive fatigue detection. Sixteen participants, balanced by sex, recruited to perform a surface finishing task with a UR10 collaborative robot under fatigued and non-fatigued states. Fatigue perception and heart rate activity data collected throughout to create a dataset for cognitive fatigue detection. Equitable machine learning models developed based on perception (survey responses) and condition (fatigue manipulation). The labeling approach had a significant impact on the accuracy and F1-score, where perception-based labels lead to lower accuracy and F1-score for females likely due to sex differences in reporting of fatigue. Additionally, we observed a relationship between heart rate, algorithm type, and labeling approach, where heart rate was the most significant predictor for the two labeling approaches and for all the algorithms utilized. Understanding the implications of label type, algorithm type, and sex on the design of fatigue detection algorithms is essential to designing equitable fatigue-adaptive human-robot collaborations across the sexes.","[Kalatzis, Apostolos; Stanley, Laura; Wittie, Mike P.] Montana State Univ, Gianforte Sch Comp, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Hopko, Sarah; Mehta, Ranjana K.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kalatzis, A (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Gianforte Sch Comp, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",,"Mehta, Ranjana/AAE-3257-2020","Kalatzis, Apostolos/0000-0002-1519-2207",,,,,39,2,2,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-0858,,978-1-6654-7927-1,IEEE INT C INT ROBOT,,,2022,,,,,,,10951,10958,,10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981097,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981097,,,8,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BU4YE,,Green Published,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000909405303007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adaptive robot behavior unavoidably carries decision-making needs regarding task allocation and scheduling. Such decisions can be made either by the human team members or autonomously, by the robot's controlling algorithm. Human authority may help preserve situational awareness but increases mental demands due to increased responsibilities. Conversely, granting authority to the robot can offload the operator, at the cost of reduced intervention readiness. This paper aims to investigate the question of decision authority assignment in a human-robot team, in terms of performance, perceived workload and subjective preference. We hypothesized that the answer is influenced by the cognitive workload imposed on the human operator by the work process. An experiment with 21 participants was conducted, in which decision authority and induced workload through a secondary task were varied between trials. Results confirmed that operators can support the robot better when decision authority is allocated according to their workload. However, operator decision authority (a) may cause inferior performance at any secondary tasks performed in parallel with robot supervision and (b) increases perceived workload. Subjective preference was found to be evenly divided between the two levels of decision authority, and unaffected by task difficulty. In brief, if human-robot team performance is a priority, humans should be granted decision authority when their overall workload allows it. In high-workload conditions, system decision-making algorithms should be developed. Nonetheless, process designers should be mindful of the interpersonal differences between operators who are destined to collaborate with robots.","[Karakikes, Michail] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Nathanael, Dimitris] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, Greece",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Technical University of Athens,"Nathanael, D (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, Greece.",mkarakikes@gmail.com; dnathan@central.ntua.gr,"Nathanael, Dimitris/AAN-1076-2021","Karakikes, Michail/0000-0002-2315-7815; Nathanael, Dimitris/0000-0003-2361-549X",Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich; HEAL-Link Greece,Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich; HEAL-Link Greece,This study was funded by Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich.

This automation system lessens the human-vision-based cognitive load and improves fabric weave pattern inspection work. However, this automation system poses a unique challenge, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional streaming data from highly precision digital microscope cameras. The complexity arises from the continuous acquisition and management of such high-dimensional streaming video data. Considering the challenges posed by dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional data, this study employs multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA)-based tensor decomposition, a statistical technique designed to effectively reduce high-dimensional datasets into low-dimensional features. This paper proposes an innovative method for fabric weave pattern recognition (FWPR) by leveraging MPCA-based tensor decomposition to extract low-dimensional features from the high-dimensional fabric's surface texture descriptor tensor (STDT). This proposed method replicates fabric pattern monitoring in automated fabric reeling systems by integrating a digital microscope camera to capture high-dimensional streaming video data from fabric surface texture features. Subsequently high-dimensional video data is converted into sequential image frames representing different fabric weave patterns. These image frames are processed with local binary pattern (LBP) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) methods to aggregate fabric's surface pattern features and construct the high-dimensional STDT. This STDT is subsequently decomposed into low-dimensional features by leveraging MPCA, resulting in an impressive 99.99% reduction in dimension. A supervised machine learning method utilizes the extracted low-dimensional features to enable FWPR, demonstrating superiority of the proposed method over the benchmark methods in evaluation.","[Al Mamun, Abdullah; Shohag, Md Abu Sayeed; Al-Kouz, Wael] Univ North Alabama, Dept Engn & Ind Profess, Florence, AL 35632 USA; [Islam, Md Imranul] Fash Inst Technol, Dept Text Dev & Mkt, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Noor, K.

Identifying human factors influencing operator error occurrence in such critical application is important to mitigate human errors. Conventional methods employed for human factor identification are often static, unable to deal with data and model uncertainty, and to consider independencies among failure modes. This study employs the integration of the soft computing technique, viz. fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), into the human factors analysis and classifying system (HFACS) framework to identify the critical human factors that contribute to human errors in the nuclear control room application. Integration of FAHP improves the HFACS framework by providing an analytical foundation and group decision-making ability in order to ensure quantitative assessment of nuclear accidents. The proposed model has two phases. The first phase is study of 18 human performance-related events that occurred in Indian nuclear power plants, utilizing HFACS to analyze and determine the human and organizational factors (HOFs) responsible for such events. Existing HFACS can only be used to detect a wide range of human factors. The proposed model further explores the underlying causes of such a wide range of factors. The hierarchy of HOFs identified as adverse mental states and organizational process factors that contributed most failures causing accident in the first phase provides inputs for the critical human factor identification to the second phase, which is a quantitative analysis using FAHP. In the second phase, more than 40 adverse mental state and organizational process factors are identified from literature survey and ten subfactors are screened and selected by human reliability assessment and control room operation experts. The study was conducted by administering a questionnaire that is comprised of the screened factors. Data have been collected from 88 senior reactor operators in an operating nuclear power plant. The critical factors contributing to human errors identified from FAHP are attention, perception and memory under cognitive factor and decision making, training and communications under organizational factor. The study results reveal that the implementation of HFACS-based FAHP methodology enabled in determining intrinsic human factors that contribute to nuclear power plant control room operator performance.","[Karthick, M.; Robert, T.

One of the main reasons behind this interest is the potential of such technologies to revolutionize human life since they intend to work robustly under complex visual scenes, which environmental conditions may vary, adapting to a comprehensive range of unforeseen changes, and exhibiting prospective behavior like predicting possible events based on cognitive capabilities that are able to sense, analyze, and act based on their analysis results. However, perceiving the environment and translating it into knowledge to be useful for the decision making process, still remains a challenge for real time applications due to the complexity of such process. In this paper, we present a multi-domain knowledge structure based on experience, which can be used as a comprehensive embedded knowledge representation for C-CPS, addressing the representation of visual content issue and facilitating its reuse. The implementation of such representation has been tested in a Cognitive Vision Platform for Hazard Control (CVP-HC) which aims to manage of workers' exposure to risks in industrial environments, facilitating knowledge engineering processes through a flexible and adaptable implementation.

On the other hand, the development of traffic control towards on-line measurement of cooperative aspects between humans and machines, is part of the more general need to measure the human agents situation awareness in industrial environment. The University of Modena and Reggio Emilia was partner of the European Artemis project Designing Dynamic Distributed Cooperative Human-Machine Systems (D3CoS 2011-2014) [1] to define affordable methods, techniques and tools addressing the specification, development and evaluation of cooperative systems where human and machine agents are in charge of common tasks, assigned to the system as a whole. One of the basic keys to reach an optimal human-machine cooperation is the measure of the human operator workload. In order to setup a possible method for the objective evaluation of cognitive workload we had to investigate aspects of the functional status of human operators interacting with a simulator in maritime domains. We recorded objective psycho-physiological measures: eye blinks, respiration rate and amplitude, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, and blood pressure. They were analyzed and correlated with subjective self-assessed responses from two questionnaires: NASA-TLX and Rating Scale Mental Effort (RSME), with the aim to realize a mathematical model for classifying the operators' mental workload. The purpose of this paper is to present the methods, applied on a pilot study, that we carried out to discriminate the WL intensity, based on psycho-physiological signals alone.","[Malagoli, Andrea; Corradini, Matteo; Corradini, Paola; Fonda, Sergio] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; [Shuett, Todd] Kongsberg Norcontrol AS, Horten, Norway",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Malagoli, A (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.",,"Malagoli, Andrea/I-7744-2015; Fonda, Sergio/D-3957-2015","Malagoli, Andrea/0000-0001-7857-4133; Fonda, Sergio/0000-0002-5981-0409",European project D3CoS [269336],European project D3CoS,"This work was part of the European project D3CoS (www.d3cos.org) founded by Artemis, SP-8, GA No: 269336.

DNNs have been widely used in Industrial Artificial Intelligence of Things (Industrial AIoT) systems. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which bring a considerable risk to Industrial AIoT systems. The adversary uses adversarial examples crafted on the local ensemble model to attack black-box target of Industrial AIoT systems, resulting in catastrophic consequences. It is essential to study ensemble adversarial attack and defense strategies in black-box scenarios. Nevertheless, current ensemble attacks' performance is limited by the diversity of local models and ensemble strategies, and defensive strategies are inefficient. To solve these problems, we propose two novel deep fusion methods from both an attacker's and a defender's perspective. For initiating attacks, we propose deep fusion attack. The erosion models are applied to compensate for local models' insufficiency in diversity. We fuse erosion models in the output space, and the feature space simultaneously and continuously accumulate historical gradients to retain adversarial information, thereby improving transferability. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance in black-box attacks, and the average success rate of our attack reaches a compelling 87.4%. For constructing defenses, we propose deep fusion defense, using a fusion of multiple predictions with erosion models as a novel approach. We successfully increase the model's robustness by more than 90% on the ImageNet dataset.","[Wang, Yajie; Tan, Yu-an] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Cyberspace Sci & Technol, Beijing 100811, Peoples R China; [Baker, Thar] Univ Sharjah, Dept Comp Sci, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Kumar, Neeraj] Thapar Univ, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Neeraj] Asia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 413, Taiwan; [Kumar, Neeraj] King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah 22254, Saudi Arabia; [Kumar, Neeraj] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Comp Sci, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttarakhand, India; [Zhang, Quanxin] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; University of Sharjah; Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology; Asia University Taiwan; King Abdulaziz University; University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); Beijing Institute of Technology,"Baker, T (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Comp Sci, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.;Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wangyajie19@bit.edu.cn; tan2008@bit.edu.cn; tshamsa@sharjah.ac.ae; neeraj.kumar@thapar.edu; zhangqx@bit.edu.cn,"Kumar, Neeraj/ABA-5200-2021; Baker, Thar/H-6073-2019","Baker, Thar/0000-0002-5166-4873; Kumar, Neeraj/0000-0002-3020-3947; Tan, Yu-An/0000-0001-6404-8853","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61876019, U1936218, 62072037]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61876019, Grant U1936218, and Grant 62072037.

To reduce the cognitive workload of the operator, the robot should not only be able to learn from experience but also to plan and decide autonomously. Here, we present an approach based on Dynamic Neural Fields that apply brain-like computations to endow a robot with these cognitive functions. A neural integrator is used to model the gradual accumulation of sensory and other evidence as time-varying persistent activity of neural populations. The decision to act is modeled by a competitive dynamics between neural populations linked to different motor behaviors. They receive the persistent activation pattern of the integrators as input. In the first experiment, a robot learns rapidly by observation the sequential order of object transfers between an assistant and an operator to subsequently substitute the assistant in the joint task. The results show that the robot is able to proactively plan the series of handovers in the correct order. In the second experiment, a mobile robot searches at two different workbenches for a specific object to deliver it to an operator. The object may appear at the two locations in a certain time period with independent probabilities unknown to the robot. The trial-by-trial decision under uncertainty is biased by the accumulated evidence of past successes and choices. The choice behavior over a longer period reveals that the robot achieves a high search efficiency in stationary as well as dynamic environments.","[Wojtak, Weronika; Ferreira, Flora; Erlhagen, Wolfram] Univ Minho, Res Ctr Math, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; [Wojtak, Weronika; Vicente, Paulo; Louro, Luis; Bicho, Estela] Univ Minho, Res Ctr Algoritmi, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Wojtak, W (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Res Ctr Math, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.;Wojtak, W (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Res Ctr Algoritmi, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",w.wojtak@dei.uminho.pt; wolfram.erlhagen@math.uminho.pt,"Louro, Luís/LDF-3933-2024; Ferreira, Flora/D-5772-2017; W, Weronika/KHY-0044-2024; Bicho, Estela/M-5241-2013","Louro, Luis Filipe/0000-0003-1708-8881; Ferreira, Flora/0000-0003-1558-7230; Vicente, Paulo Sergio/0000-0003-3474-9709; Wojtak, Weronika/0000-0001-9515-2397; Bicho, Estela/0000-0003-2715-4037; Erlhagen, Wolfram/0000-0002-8150-3587","FCT [PD/BD/128183/2016, SFRH/BD/124912/2016, PTDC/MAT-APL/31393/2017]; research centre CMAT [UID/MAT/00013/2020]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/MAT-APL/31393/2017, SFRH/BD/124912/2016, PD/BD/128183/2016] Funding Source: FCT",FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); research centre CMAT; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The work received financial support from FCT through the PhD fellowships PD/BD/128183/2016 and SFRH/BD/124912/2016, the project Neurofield (PTDC/MAT-APL/31393/2017) and the research centre CMAT within the project UID/MAT/00013/2020.",,65,17,18,0,11,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

This challenge is usually addressed with the introduction of human operators for precise tasks that require dexterity, flexibility and cognitive decision making.

Owing to the complementary nature of robots' and humans' capabilities, there is an increased interest towards a shared workspace for humans and robots to work together collaboratively, forming the motivation behind the field of human-robot collaboration (HRC). Research in HRC in industry is concerned with the safety of the humans and robots, extent, and modes of collaboration among them, and the level of autonomy and adaptability of robots that can be trained for different tasks. This paper introduces a novel taxonomy of levels of interaction between humans and robots along the lines of SAEs guidelines for autonomous vehicles in response to a need for standard definitions and evolving nature of the field.

Moreover, comprehensive sensing is required to enable accurate simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) under scenarios with clutters and moving human subjects. To achieve the goal, a CMOS-integrated radar-assisted robot sensing platform is proposed. By leveraging the phased-array radar techniques and time-phase processing techniques, high accuracy can be achieved for localization and recognition of human subjects.

Taking advantage of traditional psychological and physiological metrics for studying human cognition and behavior, researchers are applying various near-real time analysis techniques to modulate immersive experiences and influence the mental state of the user. Because of the variety of contributing sub-domains, there is little consensus as to any rigid paradigm for the knowledge being synthesized. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to determine the state of the art of dynamic cognitive augmentation in immersive environments. Following a structured query of academic publications, we conduct an in-depth analysis of 104 papers from a sample of 538. We observed that roughly 66% of papers among this frontier apply methods best suited for exploratory purposes, limiting the overall extent to which conclusions can be drawn about immersive reality technology's capability to augment human cognition. We further identify a pressing gap in the knowledge necessary for the effective application of immersive reality towards dynamic cognitive augmentation in practical industrial scenarios. We hope this work will influence academia, industry, and standards development organizations to extend the use of XR technology networked with biosensor-enabled intelligent cognitive assistants to enhance the effectiveness of hybrid human-machine systems.","[Prather, Eric A.; Badr, Arash Shahbaz; De Amicis, Raffaele] Oregon State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 2500 NW Monroe Ave, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Simoes, Bruno] Basque Res Technol Alliance BRTA, Vicomtech Fdn, Mikeletegi 57, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Spain",Oregon State University,"De Amicis, R (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 2500 NW Monroe Ave, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",deamicir@oregonstate.edu,"Simões, Bruno/AAJ-7582-2020; De+Amicis, Raffaele/AAD-4976-2021","de amicis, raffaele/0000-0002-6435-4364",,,,,51,2,2,0,6,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-3630-9,PROC SPIE,,,2020,11426,,,,,,,,114260G,10.1117/12.2563816,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2563816,,,20,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BQ4JK,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000589955000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Teaching a kinematic behavior by demonstration and encoding it with dynamical systems that are robust with respect to perturbations, is proposed in order to address this issue. Given a kinematic behavior encoded by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), this work proposes a passive control scheme for assisting kinesthetic modifications of the learned behavior in task variations. It employs the utilization of penetrable spherical Virtual Fixtures (VFs) around the DMP's virtual evolution that follows the teacher's motion. The controller enables the user to haptically 'inspect' the spatial properties of the learned behavior in SE(3) and significantly modify it at any required segment, while facilitating the following of already learned segments. A demonstration within the VFs could signify that the kinematic behavior is taught correctly and could lead to autonomous execution, with the DMP generating the newly learned reference commands. The proposed control scheme is theoretically proved to be passive and experimentally validated with a KUKA LWR4+ robot. Results are compared with the case of using a gravity compensated robot agnostic of the previously learned task. It is shown that the time duration of teaching and the user's cognitive load are reduced.","[Papageorgiou, D.; Kastritsi, T.; Doulgeri, Z.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Egnatia Str,Univ Campus, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Doulgeri, Z (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Egnatia Str,Univ Campus, Thessaloniki, Greece.",dimpapag@eng.auth.gr; tkastrit@ece.auth.gr; doulgeri@eng.auth.gr,"Kastritsi, Theodora/AAG-6361-2019; Papageorgiou, Dimitrios/T-6051-2019","Kastritsi, Theodora/0000-0002-5379-0259; Doulgeri, Zoe/0000-0003-2188-9358; Papageorgiou, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0361-8757","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research [MIS-5000432]","European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research","This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning in the context of the project Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research (MIS-5000432), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY).",,39,12,13,1,42,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

We present a systematic description of the equipment used; the robot operators' training program; the field exercise and robot tasks; and the protocols followed during the exercise. Additionally, we provide insights and suggestions for advancing disaster response robotics based on these observations. Specifically, the main degradation in performance comes from the cognitive and attentional demands on the operator. Furthermore, robotic platforms and modules should aim to be robust and reliable in addition to their ease of use. Last, as emergency response stakeholders are often skeptical about using autonomous systems, we suggest adopting a variable autonomy paradigm to integrate autonomous robotic capabilities with the human-in-the-loop gradually.

In this context, task-oriented dialogue systems allow workers to delegate simple tasks to industrial assets while working on other, more complex ones. The possibility of naturally interacting with these systems reduces the cognitive demand to use them and triggers acceptation. Most modern solutions, however, do not allow a natural communication, and modern techniques to obtain such systems require large amounts of data to be trained, which is scarce in these scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents KIDE4I (Knowledge-drIven Dialogue framEwork for Industry), a semantic-based task-oriented dialogue system framework for industry that allows workers to naturally interact with industrial systems, is easy to adapt to new scenarios and does not require great amounts of data to be constructed. This work also reports the process to adapt KIDE4I to new scenarios. To validate and evaluate KIDE4I, it has been adapted to four use cases that are relevant to industrial scenarios following the described methodology, and two of them have been evaluated through two user studies. The system has been considered as accurate, useful, efficient, not demanding cognitively, flexible and fast.

There are also cognitive psychology models designed to assess human performance without the intention of serving as HRA tools. These models have a detailed understanding of the cognitive mechanisms of human error, which is the key to a complete HRA model. One of these models, ACT-R, contains adequate quantification to serve as an HRA model. This article discusses cognitive psychology models and their internal structures in human information processing to provide human error probabilities that arise from the architecture itself and are not dependent on Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs), which are quantified by HRA current methodologies.","[Alvarenga, M.

In human-robot collaborative tasks, the objective is to help humans in performing their job with less physical and cognitive effort. A collaborative task can involve the exchange of objects between the robot and the operator. However, the handover operation should be sufficiently intuitive, fluid, and natural for being accepted by the involved humans. Naturalness strongly depends on the speed of the object exchange and the way of communication. For the latter aspect, this paper proposes a multi-modal communication based on visual and haptic cues. Concerning the handover speed requirement, the paper proposes a high-performance visual servoing based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimating object speed during the handover and a homography-based object tracking. The object safety is ensured by proper control of the robot grasp force based on a model-based approach exploiting tactile measurements. The same perception modality is also used as a source of haptic cues that make the handover intuitive and natural. Experiments of human-robot handovers through haptic and visual cues communication demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","[Costanzo, Marco; Natale, Ciro] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Ingn, I-81031 Aversa, CE, Italy; [Selvaggio, Mario] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Elect Engn & Informat Technol, I-80138 Naples, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Naples Federico II,"Costanzo, M (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Ingn, I-81031 Aversa, CE, Italy.",marco.costanzo@unicampania.it; mario.selvaggio@unina.it,"Natale, Ciro/E-7368-2012; Selvaggio, Mario/F-3591-2015; Costanzo, Marco/GVU-0814-2022",,European Commission under the Horizon Europe research grant INTELLIMAN [101070136]; European Union [101017008]; Horizon Europe - Pillar II [101070136] Funding Source: Horizon Europe - Pillar II,European Commission under the Horizon Europe research grant INTELLIMAN; European Union(European Union (EU)); Horizon Europe - Pillar II,"This work was partially supported by the European Commission under the Horizon Europe research grant INTELLIMAN, project ID: 101070136, and by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101017008.",,18,1,1,2,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1944-9445,,979-8-3503-3670-2,IEEE ROMAN,,,2023,,,,,,,2677,2682,,10.1109/RO-MAN57019.2023.10309480,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RO-MAN57019.2023.10309480,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Ergonomics; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BW1NV,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001108678600355,View Full Record in Web of Science

The combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twins (DT) has shown promising potential in enhancing the intuitiveness of human-robot interaction while leveraging digital representations of human intelligence to empower robots in manufacturing tasks. However, traditional programming methods lack intuitive interaction and rely heavily on simulation environments or pre-set CAD models, leading to high costs for both initial setup and sim-to-real deployment. On the other hand, existing AR -based robot control methods have primarily focused on the basic movements of robots, overlooking higherlevel skills necessary for complex tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces a four -layer system architecture that integrates AR -assisted DT into skill -based robotic assembly scenarios. Additionally, a skillbased and low -code programming system for human -guided robotic assembly is designed and implemented, which incorporates natural human guidance and robot autonomous intelligence to generate adaptive and feasible action plans. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are verified by two case studies and a quantitative experiment comparing to traditional programming methods. The results demonstrate the usability of our AR -assisted DT approach in improving programming efficiency, intuitiveness, and safety for human -guided robotic assembly while reducing cognitive load.","[Yin, Yue; Zheng, Pai; Li, Chengxi; Wan, Ke] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Adv Mfg, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Pai; Li, Chengxi] Lab Artificial Intelligence Design, Hong Kong Sci Pk, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Zheng, P (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Adv Mfg, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",pai.zheng@polyu.edu.hk,"ZHENG, PAI/K-7989-2012; Li, Chengxi/CAG-9066-2022; WAN, KE/KZU-4613-2024","ZHENG, PAI/0000-0002-2329-8634; Li, Chengxi/0000-0003-1921-7448","Research Institute for Advanced Manufacturing (RIAM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University [1-CDJT, 2023/24 (1-WZ4N)]; Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; General Research Fund from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [PolyU15210222, PolyU15206723]","Research Institute for Advanced Manufacturing (RIAM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; General Research Fund from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","This work was mainly supported by the funding from the Research Institute for Advanced Manufacturing (RIAM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (project code: 1-CDJT) , the intra-faculty interdisciplinary project 2023/24 (1-WZ4N) , by the Research Committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and the General Research Fund from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU15210222 and PolyU15206723) .",,40,1,1,17,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

The iterative process with a multidisciplinary design a project was built up, keeping in mind User Center Design principles and focusing on the active engagement of the user in each design stage, to validate what actions users can be asked to perform and what tasks the system has to do automatically. In the first phase, the Cognitive Ergonomists observed and interviewed Team Leaders, workers that coordinate and manage other co-workers and know critical issues of their domain tasks. In a second phase, the so-called personas tool with specific characteristics and scenarios was used to analyze users' needs. After that the new training system features were defined. Thanks to requirement definition, four thematic areas were defined: ergonomics and safety, documents and procedures, equipment and workstation and operating procedures. For each area, the training was divided into learning and practical exercises. Based on this approach, different tools have been chosen for each area. For example Augmented Reality was used for learning and acquiring information and notions, and Gamification Techniques were used for the practical exercises. Furthermore, storyboards were proposed as a new tool to help the learning process. Soon, mock-ups could be implemented to easily test with workers, validate project hypothesis, find critical issues and further support successful approaches.","[Spada, Stefania; Ghibaudo, Lidia] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Mfg Planning & Control, Turin, Italy; [Gilotta, Silvia; Isoardi, Monica] Silvia Gilotta Studio, Turin, Italy",,"Spada, S; Ghibaudo, L (corresponding author), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Mfg Planning & Control, Turin, Italy.;Gilotta, S; Isoardi, M (corresponding author), Silvia Gilotta Studio, Turin, Italy.",silvia.gilotta@gmail.com; stefania.spada@fcagroup.com; lidia.ghibaudo@fcagroup.com; monica.isoardi@libero.it,,,,,,,17,7,7,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-3-319-96071-5; 978-3-319-96070-8,ADV INTELL SYST COMP,,,2019,824,,,,,,935,943,,10.1007/978-3-319-96071-5_96,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-96071-5_96,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BN0KG,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000473061800085,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is deeply recognized that human factors are the main cause of accidents and breakdowns in various industries. Physiological mental states of human operators, like fatigue or vigilance, are crucial for the evaluation of human operators reliability. However, the shortages of measurements of physiological mental states limit their application. So human reliability analysis (HRA) is developed and many techniques have been developed. Among these techniques, cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) is often applied and discussed. Due to the application limits of common performance conditions (CPCs) in original CREAM approach, it is advised to generate a new list of CPCs for the application domain if CREAM approach is applied to other domains. In this contribution, a new approach defining a situated and dynamical human reliability measure is established. The approach is based on the well-known CREAM approach, which is modified with respect to the use in dynamical context. The new list of CPCs, their levels and corresponding effects on human reliability are determined. A new index, human performance reliability score (HPRS), is proposed for the assessment of human operator reliability.

The latest COVID-19 global epidemic is one notable example. In addition to its social impact, the virus has destroyed the traditional industrial production system. Industry 4.0 requires adapting to changing prerequisites with adaptability. However, the next movement, Industry 5.0, has emerged in recent years. Industry 5.0 takes a more coordinated approach than Industry 4.0, with increased collaboration among humans and machines. With a human-centered strategy, Industry 5.0 improves Industry 4.0 for greater sustainability and resilience. The concept of Industry 4.0 is the interconnection via cyber-physical systems. Industry 5.0, also associated with systems enabled by Industry 4.0, discusses the relationship between man and machine, called robots or cobots. This paper discusses the industry 5.0 possibilities, the restrictions, and future analysis potentials. Industry 5.0 is a new paradigm change that tends to bring negotiated settlement because it places less prominence on technology and assumes that the possibilities for advancement are predicated on collaboration between humans and machines. This paper aims to examine the potential implementations of Industry 5.0. Once the current progress and problem were discovered, the previous research on the investigated topic was reviewed, research limitations were found, and the systematic analysis procedure was developed. The classifications of industry 5.0 and the sophisticated technology required for this industry revolution are the first subjects of discussion. There is additional discussion of the application domains enabled by Industry 5.0, such as healthcare, supply chain, production growth, cloud industrial production, and so on.

It is an important device for human-computer interactions. Whether an operator is comfortable using a console is an important issue of concern in industry. However, previous works have focused only on the joint angle and muscle fatigue of the console user, with few works focusing on the eye comfort of users. In this paper, we propose a console design method based on the physical comfort of the human eye to allow consoles to satisfy the needs of a user regarding the joint angle and muscle comfort and to reduce the physiological fatigue of a user's eyes, thereby improving the operator's cognitive efficiency and accuracy. In addition, a software and hardware collaboration platform is used to effectively improve the stability and accuracy of the proposed method. We also propose a method for evaluating the human eye comfort of console users based on a dual-channel objective visual quality analysis system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an evaluation metric for determining the comfort of the human eye afforded by a console, and experiments in the real world verify the effectiveness of this metric. Through this evaluation method, a console designed by using the console optimization method proposed herein is compared with a console designed according to the previous console design method. The results prove that our proposed method can effectively improve human eye comfort when using a console.","[Su, Sheng; Gu, Sen] Xian Technol Univ, Sch Design Art & Media, Xian 710021, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yiqian] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Design Art & Media, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhengyu] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310007, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hanyu] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ind Design Dept, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wen] Xian Fourth Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Xian 710004, Peoples R China",Xi'an Technological University; Nanjing University of Science & Technology; Zhejiang University; Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Su, S (corresponding author), Xian Technol Univ, Sch Design Art & Media, Xian 710021, Peoples R China.",379084426@qq.com,"chen, zhengyu/HGC-3415-2022","Gu, Sen/0000-0002-7711-6592",Chinese Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project [20YJAZH092]; National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China [51905407],Chinese Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project; National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China,"This work was supported in part by the Chinese Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project under Grant 20YJAZH092, and in part by the National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China under Grant 51905407.",,20,3,3,2,23,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,109596,109607,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3002543,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3002543,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MH0II,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000546414000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

As the human operator is directly involved in the assembly process, the interaction between the human and the robot has to be designed carefully to avoid exposing the human to excessive physical and cognitive strain. For controlling a robotized assembly cell, a Cognitive Control Unit (CCU) was developed that uses the cognitive software Soar and human-like assembly strategies to achieve a transparent and understandable assembly process. To minimize the cognitive and ergonomic risks during assembly, the CCU was extended by a graph-based assembly sequence planner (GASP). The GASP is able to find the optimal assembly sequence by using a complete assembly graph of the final product as well as generic production rules for assessing the ergonomic conditions of the individual assembly steps. The presented simulation study validates the functionality of the GASP with respect to the number of workflow switches between the human and the robot, the number of switches between the robotic tools, as well as the number of assembly group switches required to collaboratively assemble a model of a Stromberg carburetor. The results show a significant reduction of all three measures. The number of parts and the type of assessment of the assembly steps have a significant impact here.","[Faber, Marco; Mertens, Alexander; Schlick, Christopher M.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Ind Engn & Ergon, Bergdriesch 27, D-52062 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Faber, M (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Ind Engn & Ergon, Bergdriesch 27, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",m.faber@iaw.rwth-aachen.de,,"Faber, Marco/0000-0003-0204-1490; Mertens, Alexander/0000-0002-8142-7123",German Research Foundation DFG within the Cluster of Excellence Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries,German Research Foundation DFG within the Cluster of Excellence Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors would like to thank the German Research Foundation DFG for its generous support within the Cluster of Excellence Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries.,,59,34,35,1,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-6524,1863-7353,,PROD ENG-RES DEV,Prod.

However, in practice maintaining consistency at all times is an intractable problem. Accordingly, recent paradigms for inconsistency management acknowledge that it is sometimes desirable to tolerate inconsistency, e.g. to allow distributed teamwork and prevent premature commitment to design decisions. However, a successful adoption of inconsistency managment paradigms in industry depends highly on the human factor: intolerant attitudes of practitioners toward inconsistency may pose significant barriers to a wider acceptance of these paradigms. A thorough analysis of cognitive factors is a key to overcoming these barriers. This paper reports on our preliminary empirical findings highlighting existing perceptions and attitudes of practitioners toward inconsistency, and propose dimensions for their classification.

In such methods, the operator knowledge base plays a central role. This paper proposes a method for systematically developing the knowledge base of nuclear power plant operators. The method starts with a systematic literature review of a predefined topic. Then, the many collected publications are reduced to summaries. Relevant knowledge is then extracted from the summaries using an improved qualitative content analysis method to generate a large number of pieces of knowledge. Lastly, the pieces of knowledge are integrated in a systematic way to generate a knowledge graph consisting of nodes and links. As a case study, the proposed method is applied to develop the knowledge base of reactor operators pertaining to severe accidents in nuclear power plants. The results show that the proposed method exhibits advantages over conventional methods, including reduced reliance on expert knowledge and improved traceability of the process. Generalization of the proposed method to other sources of materials and application of the knowledge base are also discussed. Although this paper is focused on nuclear applications, the proposed method may be extended to other industrial sectors with little additional effort.","[Zhao, Yunfei; Smidts, Carol] Ohio State Univ, Nucl Engn Program, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 201 W 19th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Zhao, YF (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Nucl Engn Program, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 201 W 19th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",zhao.2263@osu.edu,,"Zhao, Yunfei/0000-0003-1314-4081; Smidts, Carol/0000-0001-7867-023X",U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC-HQ-60-15-G-0002],U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,"The authors would like to thank the undergraduate students, Muhammad Anandika, Kreteeka Chaudhury, Keith Altman, and Charles Cummings, for their support in the research.

J,"Liu, JL; Yan, XL; Gao, WM",,,,"Liu, Jiale; Yan, Xiaoli; Gao, Wenmin",,,A Dualistic Perspective of Opportunity and Risk: The Impact of Head-Mounted Augmented Reality on Construction Onsite Hazard Identification of Workers,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Head-mounted display augmented reality; Construction hazard identification; Cognitive behavior and performance; Cognitive load (CL); Situational awareness,,"Head-mounted augmented reality (HMD AR) technology in construction has shown promise in enhancing operational efficiency. Concurrently, the critical role of hazard identification (HI) in ensuring worker safety is well-documented. Despite this, studies delving into HMD AR's impact on HI, especially across varying task complexities, are limited. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the influence of HMD AR on construction workers' HI in diverse task environments. The research engaged 48 participants in an experiment to evaluate their hazard situation awareness (HSA), cognitive load (CL), and task performance (TP). These were assessed using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), the Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and measures of task accuracy. Findings indicated that environmental conditions significantly modulate HMD AR's effect on HI. In simple and safe scenes, HMD AR has a negligible impact on HI and might enhance hazard detection capabilities. However, in complex and hazardous situations with intense workloads, HMD AR can impair HI, potentially increasing safety risks. In other words, whether HMD AR brings opportunities or risks for HI depends on the different environmental conditions. This research contributes to the nascent field of cognitive safety in HMD AR, specifically regarding HI in construction, augmenting the current understanding and laying a theoretical groundwork for HMD AR's future safety applications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The insights gained inform the prudent implementation, training, and interface design of HMD AR on construction sites. In the context of HMD AR's rapid evolution, this study underscores the importance of critically assessing safety implications to guide the responsible utilization of new technologies. The findings from this study reveal that the impact of HMD AR on HI is contingent upon the complexity and safety of the work environment. In scenes that are straightforward and safe, HMD AR has been shown to improve HI among participants. Conversely, in environments that are complex and fraught with danger, HMD AR may hinder HI, increasing the likelihood of hazards. The conclusions of this study suggest that the safety management and application of HMD AR on construction sites should consider the opportunities and risks of using HMD AR in different environmental conditions. It is advised that decision makers on construction sites evaluate the suitability of HMD AR deployment based on the specific complexities of their scenes. In instances where the potential hazards are intricate, the use of HMD AR might be inadvisable. For sites already utilizing HMD AR, it is crucial to provide additional safety training to users. Such training should aim to enhance awareness of how HMD AR might affect HI, equipping workers with the knowledge to mitigate potential risks effectively. Furthermore, developers of HMD AR technologies are encouraged to focus on improving the safety features of their products. A key area of improvement is the optimization of information density on the HMD AR display interface. By doing so, developers can help prevent cognitive overload among users, thereby minimizing any adverse effects on HI. This approach not only enhances the safety on construction sites but also ensures that the benefits of HMD AR can be fully realized without compromising worker safety.","[Liu, Jiale; Yan, Xiaoli] Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Management, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wenmin] Shanghai Jiguang Polytech Coll, Sch Architecture Engn, Shanghai 201901, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Engineering Science,"Yan, XL (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Management, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",M330122504@sues.edu.cn; yanxiaoli821@163.com; xue3xi1234@163.com,,,Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation Plan of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission [23692109200],Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation Plan of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission,The authors thank the funding of the Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation Plan of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (23692109200) and insightful suggestions from the anonymous reviewers and the editors.

Surrogate models are used to couple product-design choices with manufacturing process variables and material systems, hence, to connect and capture knowledge and embed intelligence in the system. Later, optimisation-driven design provides the ability to enhance the human cognitive abilities in decision-making in complex systems. This research proposes a multidisciplinary design optimisation problem to explore and exploit the interactions between different engineering disciplines using a socket prosthetic device as a case study. The originality of this research is in the conceptualisation of a computer-aided expert system capable of exploring process-structure-property-performance linkages in digital manufacturing. Thus, trade-off exploration and optimisation are enabled of competing objectives, including prosthetic socket mass, manufacturing time, and performance-tailored socket stiffness for patient comfort. The material system is modelled by experimental characterisation-the manufacturing time by computer simulations, and the product-design subsystem is simulated using a finite element analysis (1-EA) surrogate model. We used polynomial surface response-based surrogate models and a Bayesian Network for design space exploration at the embodiment design stage. Next, at detail design, a gradient descent algorithm-based optimisation exploits the results using desirability functions to isolate Pareto non-dominated solutions. This work demonstrates how advanced engineering design synthesis methods can enhance designers' cognitive ability to explore and exploit multiple disciplines concurrently and improve overall system performance, thus paving the way for the next generation of computer systems with highly intertwined material, digital design and manufacturing workflows.

Human operators are often responsible for the control of such robotic systems. However, these remote interactions require highly trained and experienced operators owing to their complex nature. Semi-autonomous systems are presented as an alternative to complex and counter-intuitive manual systems, combining decoded user intentions with autonomous control modules. This paper proposes a semi-autonomous framework for robotic telemanipulation that employs Electromyography (EMG) based motion decoding and potential fields to execute complex object stacking tasks with a dexterous robot arm-hand system. Even though simple EMG-based teleoperation is promising, the signals are often noisy leading to induced randomness and control errors. To assist the user during task executions, potential fields are utilized to avoid obstacles and guide the robot end-effector toward the objects of interest, thus reducing the cognitive load on the user and the need for accurate predictions. The user's motion is decoded from the myoelectric activations of the human upper arm and upper torso using a Random Forest-based regression methodology. The objects are detected in the environment with an external camera that provides their goal poses to the potential fields scheme. EMG control and potential fields work in a synergistic manner simplifying the system's operation. The framework performance is experimentally validated in real-time experiments involving complex cube and cylinder stacking tasks.","[Guan, Bonnie; Godoy, Ricardo V.; Sanches, Felipe; Liarokapis, Minas] Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mech Engn, New Dexter Res Grp, Auckland, New Zealand; [Dwivedi, Anany] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Autonomous Syst & Mechatron, Erlangen, Germany",University of Auckland; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Guan, B (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mech Engn, New Dexter Res Grp, Auckland, New Zealand.",bgua324@aucklanduni.ac.nz; rdeg264@aucklanduni.ac.nz; fsan668@aucklanduni.ac.nz; anany.dwivedi@fau.de; minas.liarokapis@auckland.ac.nz,"Liarokapis, Minas/E-1990-2015; Vilela de Godoy, Ricardo/GLT-9558-2022","Dwivedi, Anany/0000-0003-3262-6676",,,,,26,0,0,2,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-0858,,978-1-6654-9190-7,IEEE INT C INT ROBOT,,,2023,,,,,,,6991,6997,,10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342155,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Robotics,BW3EY,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001136907801068,View Full Record in Web of Science

To enable the full exploitation of collaborative robots traditional robot programming must be overcome. Reduction of robot programming time and worker cognitive effort during the job become compelling requirements to be satisfied. Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a core role to allow robot to adapt to a changing and unstructured environment and to human undependable execution of repetitive tasks. The paper focuses on the utilization of RL to allow a robust industrial assembly process in a HRC workcell. The result of the study is a method for the online generation of robot assembly task sequence that adapts to the unpredictable and inconstant behavior of the human co-workers.

However, the design of human-machine interaction often does not foster the motivation to learn more about their machine or system. This may decrease operators' ability to flexibly adjust their decision making and problem-solving skills to the current production context. Motivation to learn could be attained by a motivating socio-technical design of assistance systems, but suitable and context-specific design strategies are lacking. In the present study, a systematic literature review of motivation theories in education, at the workplace, and in system design was carried out. The resulting 16 theories were integrated into a conceptual model of motivating assistance system design in industrial production. In this model, learning motivation results from the satisfaction of the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which in turn is mediated through the design of the system (including interface, task, and behavior). Moreover, this process is subject to moderating influences from job characteristics, personal variables, and factors concerning the respective work domain. Strategies for motivational design are derived from the model, and an example from the discrete processing industry is used to illustrate how the model could be applied to design assistance systems in this domain. Finally, the procedures for theory selection and model development are discussed, theoretical and practical implications are derived, and alternative strategies of instilling motivation are considered.","[Dostert, Janik; Mueller, Romy] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Psychol, Chair Engn Psychol & Appl Cognit Res, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Dostert, Janik] Carmeq GmbH, Berlin, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Müller, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Psychol, Chair Engn Psychol & Appl Cognit Res, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",romy.mueller@tu-dresden.de,,"Muller, Romy/0000-0003-4750-7952",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.,,141,4,4,1,19,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1435-5558,1435-5566,,COGN TECHNOL WORK,Cogn.

One specific area where this technology is promising is the transportation of heavy and/or bulky objects. In the scenarios where the human leads, physical human-robot interaction triggers cognitive human-robot interaction, by which the robot is called to adapt its behavior to the collaborator's intention. Based on this principle, this paper introduces a novel control architecture, namely assistive force control (AFC), by which the robot's purpose is to alleviate the human collaborator's effort during transportation. Instead of acting on the robot's motion, the AFC acts on its causes, by intuitively defining assistive forces, which are input to a lower-level direct force controller. We validate the proposed architecture on two real-case transportation scenarios involving an industrial robot collaboratively carrying objects with different subjects. Our preliminary results show that low effort is required for human operators to manipulate heavy objects, confirming that the proposed architecture is well-suited for collaborative transportation in real-world scenarios.","[Lima, Bruno G.

Inspired by the confirmation dialog boxes commonly utilized in graphical user interfaces, this study proposes design strategies for effective tangible confirmation behaviors in HMIs. Initially, a workshop was conducted to gather design cases and explore potential design opportunities in future scenarios. By analysing the outcomes, we propose an evaluation method for assessing the necessity and complexity requirements of confirmation design and introduce a design library considering complexity levels graded by users' time, effort, and cognitive load expenditure. Subsequently, a user behavior experiment was conducted to validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed strategies. Our strategies offer valuable references for designers, highlighting the significance of confirmation design in preventing human errors. Following these strategies, designers and engineers can integrate more Kansai engineering principles into HMIs to ensure user safety, protect property, and enhance interaction efficiency.","[Zhang, Yuyang; Hu, Bin; Tang, Xin; Tao, Ye] Hangzhou City Univ, Sch Art & Archaeol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuyang; Lou, Shanghua; Pan, Deying; Fan, Yitao; Jian, Ye; Ren, Lei; Chen, Liuqing; Wang, Guanyun] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuebin] Royal Coll Art, Sch Design, London, England; [Hu, Bin; Tang, Xin] Univ Waikato Joint Inst Hangzhou City Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Huang, Huan] Hangzhou City Univ, Int Sch Cultural Tourism, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Hangzhou City University; Zhejiang University; Royal College of Art - UK; Hangzhou City University,"Tao, Y (corresponding author), Hangzhou City Univ, Art Bldg 3,Huzhou St 51, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",taoye@hzcu.edu.cn,"Chen, Liuqing/HPE-0376-2023; zhang, yuyang/ITV-0578-2023",,"Fundamental Research Funds of Hangzhou City University [J-202305, X-202306]; Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University [A2316]","Fundamental Research Funds of Hangzhou City University; Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University","This work was supported by Fundamental Research Funds of Hangzhou City University (No. J-202305 and X-202306), and Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG (No. A2316), Zhejiang University.",,79,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0954-4828,1466-1837,,J ENG DESIGN,J.

In order to objectively quantify human behavior and task context by HRA results, modifying factors are usually adopted to quantify the final human error probability (HEP) based on the qualitative analysis of the operator's erroneous actions and task context. A complete factor modification method consists of modifying factor selection, factor modification strategy and factor modification mechanism (mathematical logic of how the modifying factors influence HEP). In this paper, based on the analysis of connotation and selection of modifying factors in HRA methods and according to the distinctions among factor modifying objects in human reliability quantitative assessment, three kinds of factor modification strategies are generalized from factor modification methods in existing HRA methods and detailedly analyzed and reviewed as well, namely systemic-parameter-based, cognitive-behavior-based and simulation-based factor modification strategies. Meanwhile, the factor modification mechanism in before-mentioned factor modification methods are analyzed and summarized.","[Pan, Xing; He, Congjiao; Wen, Tianjian] Beihang Univ, Sch Reliabil & Syst Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Pan, X (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Reliabil & Syst Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hecongjiaocareer@gmail.com,"Pan, Xing/S-7613-2018","Pan, Xing/0000-0002-8997-7840","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70901004, 71171008]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 70901004 / No. 71171008, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

This work examines two types of techniques of safe collaboration that do not interrupt the flow of collaboration as far as possible, namely proactive and adaptive. The former are materialised using audio and visual cognitive aids, which the user receives as dynamic stimuli in real time during collaboration, and are aimed at information enrichment of the latter. Adaptive techniques investigated refer to the robot; according to the first one of them the robot decelerates when a forthcoming contact with the user is traced, whilst according to the second one the robot retracts and moves to the final destination via a modified, safe trajectory, so as to avoid the human. The effectiveness as well as the activation criteria of the above techniques are investigated in order to avoid possible pointless or premature activation. Such investigation was implemented in a prototype highly interactive and immersive Virtual Environment (VE), in the framework of H-R collaborative hand lay-up process of carbon fabric in an industrial workcell. User tests were conducted, in which both subjective metrics of user satisfaction and performance metrics of the collaboration (task completion duration, robot mean velocity, number of detected human-robot collisions etc.) After statistical processing, results do verify the effectiveness of safe collaboration techniques as well as their acceptability by the user, showing that collaboration performance is affected to a different extent.

So, the main application of the tools and methods here presented are related to the industrial and service operations management, when this managerial facet is treated with the age variable and its relation to the cognitive fatigue. The aging issue in the work context is becoming a significant element of the future sustainability of service and industrial companies. It is well known that with increasing worker age the problem of maintaining the performance and the safety level when fatigue increases is a crucial point, and fatigue increases with the age. Due to social and political developments, especially in Western countries, the retirement age is increasing and companies operate with a higher workforce mean age. Therefore, the problem of recognizing and measuring fatigue has become a key aspect in the management of aging. Note that in the scientific engineering field, the problem of fatigue evaluation when a worker is performing his/her work activities is an important issue in the industrial and service world and especially in the context of the researchers that are investigating the human reliability assessment. As it is clear from the literature, the industrial operations management are suffering from some misleading concepts that only the medicine scientific context can clarify. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to define what are the open issues and the misleading concepts present in the classical fatigue evaluation methods, and second to define two experimental curves of fatigue that will help the decision makers to minimize the impact of fatigue on the workers, thus maximizing the sustainability of the working tasks assigned. This aim is achieved by examining the medical literature about the measurement of a particular kind of fatigue related to the circadian cycle, i.e., the cognitive one; after that, a survey about the possible technologies for measurements is performed. On the basis of technology selection, an experiment on real work activities is performed and some remarkable results about the fatigue in the workers observed and the technology use and its limitations are defined.","[Fera, Marcello; Caputo, Francesco; Caterino, Mario; Macchiaroli, Roberto] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Ingn, Via Roma 29, I-81031 Aversa, Italy; [De Padova, Vittoria] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Psicol, Viale Ellitt 31, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Di Pasquale, Valentina] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Ingn Ind, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Salerno,"Fera, M (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Ingn, Via Roma 29, I-81031 Aversa, Italy.",marcello.fera@unicampania.it; vittidep@hotmail.it; vdipasquale@unisa.it; francesco.caputo@unicampania.it; mario.caterino@unicampania.it; roberto.macchiaroli@unicampania.it,"Macchiaroli, Roberto/AAS-2112-2021; Caterino, Mario/HJP-3641-2023; Fera, Marcello/I-1284-2019","Fera, Marcello/0000-0002-3418-355X; Caterino, Mario/0000-0003-2288-3994; MACCHIAROLI, Roberto/0000-0001-6260-676X; Caputo, Francesco/0000-0002-5969-7696; DI PASQUALE, VALENTINA/0000-0003-1304-3432",University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli,University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli,This work was supported by the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli under SCISSOR Project-V:alere program 2019.,,108,3,3,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Working memory and processing efficiency did not differ between seasons (p > 0.05), however counting and recall latencies improved throughout the swing (p < 0.05). Participants reported greater fatigue post-shift compared to pre-shift (p < 0.05). Thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and hydration were significantly elevated in summer compared to winter (p < 0.05). Specifically, workers were significantly/minimally dehydrated in summer/winter (urinary specific gravity = 1.025 +/- 0.007/1.018 +/- 0.007). Although cognitive function and thermal strain were not impaired in summer compared to winter, it is essential to reinforce worker's knowledge regarding hydration requirements.

However, the design of interfaces between the human-in-the-loop and production systems poses challenges not yet been sufficiently elaborated in research and practice. We present two behavioural studies in the context of inter-company collaboration that show why considering the human-in-the-loop is crucial: The first study shows that information complexity and individual differences shape the overall decision quality. With increasing information complexity, the decision speed decreases and the decision accuracy descends. Consequently, a fine balance between necessary, abundant, and superfluous information must be found. The second experiment studies human decision making in complex environments using a business simulation. We found that correct decision aids can augment the human-in-the-loop's decision making and that these can increase usability, trust, and proft. Yet, incorrect decision support has the opposite effect.

Novice operators develop such process knowledge during training. Hence, holistic assessment of operators' training is essential to ensure process safety. Currently, during training, operators' process understanding is evaluated using criteria such as successful completion, task based measures, and operator actions that ignore their cognitive behavior. In this work, we propose an eye-tracking-based approach that uses the operator's attention allocation during different pre-specified training scenarios along with process data, alarm information, and operator actions. Our approach is based on the precept that an operator would focus their attention on those variables on the human-machine interface that they believe have a direct causal relationship to the situation at hand. Also, expert operators seek time-based information for proactive monitoring. Accordingly, to quantify the progress of a novice operator's learning, we develop two metrics - association metric and salience metric - using correspondence analysis of operators' eye gaze. To evaluate the applicability of the metrics, we conducted experiments with ten participants who performed 486 tasks. Statistical studies reveal that the proposed metrics can quantify operators' learning and thus can be used to objectively evaluate training effectiveness. (c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

This generally implies an unsustainable cognitive workload for the human operators, in addition to a non-negligible training effort. To overcome this issue, in this paper we present a methodology for the design of adaptive human-centred HMIs for industrial machines and robots. The proposed approach relies on three pillars: measurement of user's capabilities, adaptation of the information presented in the HMI, and training of the user.

Cognitive routing leverages the sixth-generation (6G) self-organized networks with self-learning feature. This article presents a self-organized cognitive routing framework for a KDN which uses link-reliability as a routing metric. It reduces end-to-end latency by choosing the most reliable path with minimal probability of route-flapping. The proposed framework precalculates all possible paths between every pair of nodes and ensures self-healing with a constant-time convergence. An experimental test-bed has been developed to benchmark the proposed framework against the industry-stranded link-state and distance-vector routing algorithms SPF and DUAL, respectively.","[Ghosh, Saptarshi; Dagiuklas, Tasos; Iqbal, Muddesar] London South Bank Univ, Sch Engn, Div Comp Sci & Informat, London SE1 0AA, England; [Wang, Xinheng] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Sch Adv Technol, Dept Mechatron & Robot, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China",London South Bank University; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Iqbal, M (corresponding author), London South Bank Univ, Sch Engn, Div Comp Sci & Informat, London SE1 0AA, England.",ghoshs4@lsbu.ac.uk; tdagiuklas@lsbu.ac.uk; m.iqbal@lsbu.ac.uk; xinheng.wang@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Iqbal, Muddesar/JJC-7510-2023; Wang, Xinheng (Henry)/AAQ-3959-2021","Iqbal, Muddesar/0000-0002-8438-6726; Ghosh, Saptarshi/0000-0002-1257-0436; Wang, Xinheng/0000-0001-8771-8901",European Framework Program [H2020-MSCARISE-2016-734545],European Framework Program(European Union (EU)),This work was supported in part by H2020-MSCA-RISE-2016 European Framework Program under Grant H2020-MSCARISE-2016-734545.,,29,14,15,3,28,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1551-3203,1941-0050,,IEEE T IND INFORM,IEEE Trans.

Eighteen participants performed a simulated industrial assembly operation, including one trial with no interruption and eight others presenting an interruption task. Interruption conditions comprised a full crossing of task similarity to the primary assembly operation (similar, dissimilar) and complexity (simple, complex) with replication for each participant. Order of condition presentation was randomized. Findings revealed greater time to return to primary visual-manual assembly performance after a similar task interruption. Results also indicated complex interruptions may promote cognitive arousal that increases productivity following assembly interruptions. The majority of results are explained in terms of the Activation-Based Memory for Goals model. Findings provide some guidance for interruption management protocol design for workers engaged in procedural visual-manual assembly operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We combined subjective and objective data to evaluate the cognitive workload during an assembly task in three different scenarios in which we manipulated various features of the workstation and interaction modalities. Our results showed that participants experienced a reduction in cognitive workload in each of the three trials, indicating an improvement in cognitive performance. Additionally, we found that user acceptance predicted perceived stress across the trials but did not significantly impact the cognitive workload. Trust was not found to moderate the relationship between cognitive workload and perceived stress.

Specifically, the deployment of collaborative robots (cobots) has changed the game in modern smart factories. These robotic agents assist human operators, working with them side-by-side on joint task execution. Because cobots are designed to be more co-workers than tools, fluent interaction between the operators and their robotic counterparts is critical for employees' task accomplishment and, thus, high performance. The current study investigates the relationships between four perspectives of human-robot interaction fluency (i.e., the human emotions-oriented, the human contribution-oriented, the robot-oriented, and the team-oriented fluency) and operators' subjective job performance. It also examines the mediating role of work engagement in these relationships. The analysis carried out on 190 male and female cobot operators working on the shop floor showed positive associations between human-robot interaction (HRI) fluency and job performance. The study confirmed the mediating role of work engagement in the relationships of human contribution-oriented fluency and team-oriented fluency with job performance. The obtained results suggest that HRI fluency relates to employee job performance because of the positive affective-cognitive state experienced by the operator when cooperating with a cobot in a coordinated and well-synchronized manner. The findings of the study are discussed within the theoretical framework of cognitive ergonomics, the Job Demand-Control-Support model, the job demands-resources model, and the job design perspective. The article finishes with a conclusion of the results and implications for organizational practice.","[Paliga, Mateusz] Univ Silesiaia Katowice, Inst Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Grazynskiego 53, PL-40126 Katowice, Poland",University of Silesia in Katowice,"Paliga, M (corresponding author), Univ Silesiaia Katowice, Inst Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Grazynskiego 53, PL-40126 Katowice, Poland.",mateusz.paliga@us.edu.pl,"Paliga, Mateusz/ABA-3481-2021","Paliga, Mateusz/0000-0002-8538-874X",Research Excellence Initiative of the University of Silesia in Katowice,Research Excellence Initiative of the University of Silesia in Katowice,Funding Publication co -financed by the funds granted under the Research Excellence Initiative of the University of Silesia in Katowice.,,103,13,15,22,97,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8890,1872-793X,,ROBOT AUTON SYST,Robot.

However, fatalities and injuries relating to EWP use are of concern within the construction industry, with crushing risks often a significant factor in operator fatalities. With a greater number of workers using these machines internationally, it is imperative to develop policies and strategies to guarantee the safe use of EWPs. One key issue is that EWP familiarisation has been primarily centred on the user manual. However, it is unclear if user manuals are an adequate source of education and training in terms of content and readability. To address this research gap, a content analysis was used to assess the differences in content and readability among the manuals of the most used EWPs in Australia. The qualitative findings showed that there are nine safety-related themes in the user manuals, such as control warnings and in-basket safety. The quantitative analysis found that some manuals require several years of education above that recommended for a universal audience (>8 years) to be understood. This finding calls for better training and education across the range of EWP control layouts and standardisation across the methods by which the manuals convey control information to reduce the cognitive load placed on operators to remember and accurately utilise the controls of the wide variety of existing EWPs.","[Briant, Oliver; Tichon, Jennifer; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Ctr Accid Res & Rd Safety Queensland CARRS Q, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4509, Australia; [Diver, Phil] Construct Training Ctr, Salisbury, SA, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Briant, O (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Ctr Accid Res & Rd Safety Queensland CARRS Q, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4509, Australia.",oscar.oviedotrespalacios@qut.edu.au,"Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/IUQ-1875-2023; Tichon, Jennifer/C-5004-2013; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/K-2462-2012","Tichon, Jennifer/0000-0003-0454-290X; Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar/0000-0001-5916-3996",Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE200101079],Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award(Australian Research Council),The authors declare that they have no k nown competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The results are based on cognitive ergonomics. The experiment used eye-tracking methods and a questionnaire to gather data. The independent variables were interface complexity and user background. Interface complexity had three levels: high interface complexity, moderate interface complexity and low interface complexity. User background had two levels: the novice group and the expert group. The dependent variables included time to first fixation, fixations before and subjective feelings. A total of 38 operators participated in the experiment, and the results showed that (1) interface complexity caused a significant difference in time to first fixation (P < 0.05) and fixations before (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the results revealed significant differences between high complexity interfaces compared to low complexity interfaces (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between moderate and low complexity interfaces or between moderate and high complexity interfaces (P > 0.05); (2) user background significantly affected the user experience; (3) within the same complexity level, expert operators' cognitive workload was significantly lower than that of novice operators; and (4) there was no significant relationship between the interface complexity and the user's background. The study concludes that because interface complexity has a significant effect on the time taken to locate the target button on the screen, interface design should be as simple as possible, while still providing the necessary level of functionality.","[Wu, Lei; Zhu, Zhijuan; Cao, Huai; Li, Bin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Wu, L (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.",lei.wu@hust.edu.cn,"lei, wu/N-8380-2013","lei, wu/0000-0002-3821-9839",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities HUST [2014QN017],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities HUST(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We thank our reviewers for their valuable and insightful comments.

Previous research in functional near-infrared spectroscopy, for example, has observed changes in cerebral hemodynamic response during periods of high demand within tasks. This work investigated the relationships among task demand, fatigue, and attention degradation in a sustained attention task, and their effect on heart rate, breathing rate, nose temperature and hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus. Analysis revealed a small but significant effect of fatigue on heart rate relative to baseline, breathing rate and hemodynamic response. Task demand had a small but significant effect on breathing rate and nose temperature, both relative to baseline, but no difference between levels of demand was observed in heart rate or hemodynamic response. Our results provide insight into what physiological data can tell us about cognitive state, ability to focus, and the impact of fatigue over time.","[Argyle, Elizabeth M.; Marinescu, Adrian; Lawson, Glyn; Sharples, Sarah] Univ Nottingham, Human Factors Res Grp, Nottingham, England; [Wilson, Max L.] Univ Nottingham, Mixed Real Lab, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Argyle, EM (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Human Factors Res Grp, Nottingham, England.",elizabeth.argyle@nottingham.ac.uk; adrian.marinescu@nottingham.ac.uk; max.wilson@nottingham.ac.uk; glyn.lawson@nottingham.ac.uk; sarah.sharples@nottingham.ac.uk,"Wilson, Max/AAH-8739-2021","Argyle, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2395-3897",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/R032718/1]; EPSRC [EP/R032718/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant number EP/R032718/1].

Allowing customers to perceive product differentiation is a critical factor for most design methods developed for mass customization. This study examines 3D part search from the human cognitive perspective. We designed and conducted a quasi-factorial experiment to understand how structured variations of four factors-the shape, type, dimension, and location of the feature volume of a part model-affect human judgment of part similarity. The corresponding factorial similarity values were computed with different shape signatures in the form of the feature adjacency graph. The human responses were obtained by paired comparisons of test parts, and quantified as the cognitive similarity. Statistical analysis of the experimental results showed that the type and shape factors played an important role in the subjects' judgments. Back-propagation neural networks were trained to model the correlations between the cognitive and the factorial similarity values. The performance of the networks validates our idea of incorporating human cognition into assessment of 3D part similarity. This study presents a systematic approach for personalized part search that reflects individual perception of shape similarity.","[Chu, Chih-Hsing; Cheng, Han-Chung] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Lo, Cheng-Hung] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Ind Design, Suzhou, Peoples R China",National Tsing Hua University; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Chu, CH (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",chchu@ie.nthu.edu.tw,"Lo, Cheng-Hung/ABG-7599-2020; Chu, Chih-Hsing/AAH-7772-2020; Chu, Chih-Hsing/F-6019-2014","Lo, Cheng-Hung/0000-0002-7199-9339; Chu, Chih-Hsing/0000-0002-4673-5825",,,,,24,2,2,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0956-5515,1572-8145,,J INTELL MANUF,J.

Consequently, manufacturing companies are being forced to consistently increase flexibility and responsiveness of their production systems in order to accommodate changes of the fluctuating market. Among various forms of production systems, human-centred manufacturing systems can offer such a capability in dealing with product variations and production volumes as human workers can always adapt themselves to perform multiple tasks after a learning process. However, human performance can also be unpredictable and it may alter due to varying psychological and physiological states, which are often overlooked by researchers when designing, implementing or evaluating a manufacturing system. This paper presents a study aiming to address these issues by exploring human factors and their interactions that may affect human performance on human-centred assembly systems. The study was carried out based on a literature review and an industrial survey. Critical system performance indicators, which are affected by human factors, were evaluated and the most significant human factors were identified using the fuzzy extent analysis method. The research findings show that experience is the most significant human factor that affects individual human performance, compared to age and general cognitive abilities in human-centred assembly. By contrast, both human reaction time and job satisfaction have the least effect on human performance. The significance of ageing on human performance was also studied and it was concluded that average assembly time of human workers rises by average 1% per year after the age of 38 years old.","[Abubakar, Maji I.; Wang, Qian] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Mech & Design Engn, Portsmouth, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Abubakar, MI (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Mech & Design Engn, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",maji.abubakar@myport.ac.uk; qian.wang@port.ac.uk,"Abubakar, Maji/AAA-4364-2021",,Nigerian government through the Petroleum Technology Development Fund [PTDF/ED/PHD/MIA/780/15],Nigerian government through the Petroleum Technology Development Fund,"The authors wish to express their gratitude to the Nigerian government through the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (grant number PTDF/ED/PHD/MIA/780/15) for their financial support in this study.

A salient contribution of this research effort is focused on adopting the concept of load cell for the system of human-performance measurement. The developed novel system is capable of measuring cognitive and motor action responses simultaneously. The performance measurement system designed for this work may be replicated for other fields where systems are operated through control panels and also where responses of mentally retarded human-beings (or the human beings with the symptoms of Alzheimer disease) are to be observed and evaluated. As regard to the evaluation and trustworthiness of the designed research, search time, motor action time and applied force were selected as response variables to evaluate the CNC machine operator's performance. Based on Taguchi's experimental design, a full factorial design consisting of 27 (33) experimentswas used to collect the data for human performances. The collected data were analyzed using grey relational analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and F-test. ANOVAwas carried out using Design-Expert software. The designed research has achieved a reasonable degree of validity through performing confirmation test. This study has presented an effective approach for the optimization of the HCMI environment with multiperformance characteristics based on the combined Taguchi method and Grey relational analysis. Relevance to industry: The findings of this work are directly applicable to the practical field to improve the design of a CNC-machines system. This work suggests that those responsible for the functioning and operation of CNC-machines workstations would have to redesign the system to reduce musculoskeletal injuries and other related problems. The present results can be quite useful for future system designers. It is emphasized that applying ergonomic principles to the design of CNC machines and interfaces can not only help to enhance machine performance and productivity but can also enable the human operator to feel comfortable and secure. As most companies have acquired automated manufacturing technology in recent years to be competitive, ergonomic and safety considerations are of the utmost importance.","[Khan, Imtiaz Ali] Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India",Aligarh Muslim University,"Khan, IA (corresponding author), Aligarh Muslim Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh, India.",fayaqnoor@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,66,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1955-2513,1955-2505,,INT J INTERACT DES M,Int.

Contextual information plays an important role when the objective is to reason such as humans do, as it can make the difference between achieving a weak, generalized set of outputs and a clear, target and confident understanding of a given situation. Nevertheless, dealing with contextual information still remains a challenge in cognitive systems applications due to the complexity of reasoning about it in real time in a flexible but yet efficient way. In this paper, we enrich a cognitive system with contextual information coming from different sensors and propose the use of stream reasoning to integrate/process all these data in real time, and provide a better understanding of the situation in analysis, therefore improving decision-making.

Although this complexity enables us to perceive the world around us and interact with it, it is also a great source of variability when it comes to controlling the quality of products in a manufacturing environment. Indeed, human subjectivity and preferences, as well as the level of cognitive charge, directly influence the performance of a controller, thus impacting the resulting quality of accepted products, as well as the related economical costs and costumer satisfaction level. We address this issue through three propositions that aim at managing the sense of touch in the context of industrial quality control. (1) The proposed formalization of haptic sensations simplifies the description vocabulary and avoids confusing sensations mix. Nine generic elementary sensations were extracted from a semantic analysis of usual descriptors, and used to define generic haptic anomalies. (2) The modelling of the influence of exploration conditions on haptic perception enables to set common and coherent ways to touch objects. (3) The structuring of the control process is inspired by previous studies in visual quality control. It was applied to the sense of touch and adapted to its specificities. In particular, an intelligent decision method based on the exploration model is proposed, to improve the performance of quality control, and reduce the cognitive charge of controllers for them to focus on perceived sensations. This paper presents the solutions proposed in order to solve the problems associated with the use of the human somatosensory system as a measurement system, while minimizing the variability of quality control decisions.","[Albert, Bruno; Maire, Jean-Luc; Pillet, Maurice] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, SYMME Lab, F-74940 Annecy Le Vieux, France; [Albert, Bruno; de Beuvron, Francois de Bertrand] INSA Strasbourg, ICube Lab, SDC Team, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Zanni-Merk, Cecilia] INSA Rouen, LITIS Lab, F-76800 St Etienne Du Rouvray, France; [Albert, Bruno; Charrier, Julien; Knecht, Christophe] INEVA, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Albert, B (corresponding author), Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, SYMME Lab, F-74940 Annecy Le Vieux, France.;Albert, B (corresponding author), INSA Strasbourg, ICube Lab, SDC Team, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.;Albert, B (corresponding author), INEVA, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",bruno.albert@ineva.fr,"Maire, Jean-Luc/R-5677-2019",,French technological research association (ANRT); company INEVA,French technological research association (ANRT); company INEVA,"This study is the result of a collaboration between three parties, which are all thanked : the company INEVA, the ICube laboratory (Universite de Strasbourg) and the SYMME laboratory (Universite Savoie Mont Blanc).

One of the key concerns in the industry is the management of workers' safety behavior. This paper aims to explore the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of not anchoring a safety harness when working at height. In addition, multiple stepwise linear regression, artificial neural network, and decision tree techniques were applied in the study to assess their usefulness in evaluating survey data of safety cognitive factors. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was adopted to model the cognitive factors influencing the unsafe behavior of scaffolders. The TPB postulates that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms affect the intention of workers, which ultimately affects intentional behavior. The unsafe act of not anchoring harnesses while working on a scaffold was selected as the focal behavior based on observations and interviews with safety supervisors. Supervisors also provided their opinions on the underlying reasons for the unsafe act. A questionnaire was then developed based on the site observations, interviews, and literature review. Subsequently, 40 migrant workers from Bangladesh, India, and China were surveyed. Stepwise multiple linear regression, neural network, and decision tree analyses were implemented. The analyses revealed that subjective norm was the key variable influencing a worker's decision to anchor the safety harness. The significance of subjective norm was probably affected by the national culture of the migrant workers. In addition, the analyses showed that the relationships between the variables were probably nonlinear, thus neural network and decision tree are suitable techniques. The exploratory study provides the basis for design of an in-depth study on the cognitive factors influencing safety behavior and it expands the choice of analyses techniques.

A human-robot hybrid cell is developed where a human and a robot collaborate to perform assembly of components in manufacturing. Human and robot's mutual trust, an expression of human and machine cognition, is modeled and computed in real-time for the collaborative task. In the proposed C-CPS framework, a cyber system (software system) along with necessary hardware (sensors) computes the mutual trust in real-time based on the performance and precision of the physical system (human and robot). The computed mutual trust is then communicated to the robot via the software system and to the human via a visual interface. The computed trust values are also used to control the motion of the robot based on an algorithm, and to stimulate the action of the human based on warnings communicated to the human via the visual interface. The performance of the physical system also impacts the cyber system (computing), and the vice versa. The framework is implemented with an actual human-robot collaborative assembly task. The experimental evaluation results show satisfactory performance of the proposed C-CPS in term of human-system interaction, manufacturing efficiency and quality.","[Rahman, S. M.

In the last decade, testing research has gone deeper and broader to help with the challenging task of catching bugs. Much of the literature approaches the problem from a theoretical-technical perspective and is often oriented to automated solutions. Yet, there is a gap between industry testing problems and research testing solutions. We take a different perspective and consider the human component as a major part of the solution for practical testing problems. Many of these human-related issues are reported in academic surveys of practitioners. We highlight the importance of human factors in testing by introducing a hunting metaphor. We also bring attention to evidence on cognitive support demands in unit test practices. An initial framework is proposed as an effort to bring understanding of cognitive support demands, and provides direction for further research on unit testing tools which support tester skill improvement.","[Prado, Marllos Y.; Verbeek, Eric; Storey, Margaret-Anne] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Prado, Marllos Y.] Inst Fed Goias, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Prado, Marllos Y.] Univ Fed Goias, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Vincenzi, Auri M.

A human -robot collaboration assembly system is developed using extended reality (XR) and blockchain technologies. This system includes the physical, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) supporting, and blockchain systems. Virtual avatars represent physical operators and mobile robots in the XR environment. The VR system emulates real-time physical operations, facilitating pre -planning, online task optimization, and converting strategic decisions into executable instructions for physical robots. The AR system enhances the cognitive experience of intelligent operators, contributing to decision -making and VR system control through multi -modal interactions. The integration of the VR and AR systems in perception -decision -control enables real-time process optimization and the reverse control of physical operations. The system is implemented using a decentralized blockchain and end -edge -cloud collaborative network architecture to regulate interaction permissions for each scene characters, ensuring systematic functionality, robust communication, and comprehensive data management. A case study of a gearbox assembly is used to demonstrate the system 's development and efficacy. The results indicate the VR system 's comprehensive perception and the AR system 's detailed insights, yielding reliable information on global and local levels. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and spatiotemporal visualization during VR decision -making provides computational advantages. Incorporating human input into the AR system enables human -in -the -loop operational decision -making, providing optimal instructions to improve human -robot collaboration performance. Notably, the fusion of blockchain and end -edge -cloud architectures augments inter -system data exchange by efficiently managing and processing human -robot interactions and their diverse avatars. This system offers an innovative approach to human -robot collaboration assembly in manufacturing, with implications for analogous contexts.","[Xie, Jiacheng; Liu, Yali; Wang, Xuewen; Fang, Shukai; Liu, Shuguang] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China; [Xie, Jiacheng; Liu, Yali; Wang, Xuewen; Fang, Shukai; Liu, Shuguang] Shanxi Key Lab Fully Mechanized Coal Min Equipment, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China",Taiyuan University of Technology,"Wang, XW (corresponding author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China.",wangxuewen@tyut.edu.cn,"Liu, Yali/JVN-2932-2024",,Central Guidance on Local Science and Technology Development Fund of Shanxi Province [YDZJSX2022A014]; Shanxi Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talent Team [202204051001017]; Shanxi 1331 Project [1331]; Key Project of Merit funding for scientific and Technological Activities of Overseas Educated Personnel in Shanxi Province [2023008]; Research Project Supported of Shanxi Scholarship Council of China [2023-071],Central Guidance on Local Science and Technology Development Fund of Shanxi Province; Shanxi Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talent Team; Shanxi 1331 Project; Key Project of Merit funding for scientific and Technological Activities of Overseas Educated Personnel in Shanxi Province; Research Project Supported of Shanxi Scholarship Council of China,Central Guidance on Local Science and Technology Development Fund of Shanxi Province [grant number YDZJSX2022A014] ; Shanxi Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talent Team [grant number 202204051001017] ; Shanxi 1331 Project [grant number 1331] ; Key Project of Merit funding for scientific and Technological Activities of Overseas Educated Personnel in Shanxi Province [grant number 2023008] ; Research Project Supported of Shanxi Scholarship Council of China [grant number 2023-071] .,,77,3,3,40,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

In this paper, on the basis of experimental studies available in literature concerning lab tests on motor or cognitive abilities of differently aged subjects, an information-based theoretical model is proposed. The model allows to quantify the information content of a motor or a cognitive task and provides estimates of information processing time of individuals of different age and sex in accomplishing tasks with prevalent motor or cognitive nature, in spite of the fact that a pure cognitive or a pure motor task are rarely observed in practical cases. The model is then applied to a case study from automotive industry in which workforce aging phenomenon is experienced. Potential applications of the model go beyond the case study developed. Quantifying the information content of a general motor-cognitive task paves the way to new understanding and modelling of movements and performance time of both natural and artificial systems with applications in industrial robotics (e.g., human-robot cooperation), biomechanics, and neurorehabilitation.","[Digiesi, Salvatore; Cavallo, Daniela; Lucchese, Andrea] Polytech Univ Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Mummolo, Carlotta] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",Politecnico di Bari; New Jersey Institute of Technology,"Digiesi, S (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",salvatore.digiesi@poliba.it; daniela.cavallo@poliba.it; andrea.lucchese@poliba.it; cmummolo@njit.edu,"Lucchese, Andrea/HIR-9756-2022; Digiesi, Salvatore/C-2895-2015; Mummolo, Carlotta/AAD-8438-2019","Digiesi, Salvatore/0000-0001-8678-4771; Cavallo, Daniela/0000-0003-4544-5815; Lucchese, Andrea/0000-0001-9792-4506; Mummolo, Carlotta/0000-0002-4231-7183","Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), SO4SIMS project (Smart Operators 4.0 based on Simulation for Industry and Manufacturing Systems-Project) [PRIN-2017FW8BB4]","Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), SO4SIMS project (Smart Operators 4.0 based on Simulation for Industry and Manufacturing Systems-Project)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This research was funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), SO4SIMS project (Smart Operators 4.0 based on Simulation for Industry and Manufacturing Systems-Project PRIN-2017FW8BB4).",,75,7,7,2,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Unlike the design of the present as well as the past generation of unimodal interfaces which is more often functionally oriented, the design of multimodal enactive interfaces is strongly anchored on the users' experience: such a design has to overcome both the technological limitations as well as the biological challenges in order to deliver the experience in a realistic manner similar to that of a human-human interaction. Although a seamless integration of multimodal information during a human-human interaction occurs in a natural fashion with ease, such a simultaneous delivery and integration of multichannel information during a human-machine interaction is highly challenging in real time. This article calls for the multimodal enactive interfaces to ensure a delivery of realistic multimodal experiences to the users and to aim this multisensory integration both from technology as well as cognitive science point of views need to be considered during the design process.","[Gunasekaran, Harish] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Gunasekaran, H (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy.",ngharish18@gmail.com,,"Gunasekaran, Harish/0000-0002-5918-3695",,,,,35,0,0,0,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2375-1312,,978-1-7281-4793-2,INT CONF COGN INFO,,,2019,,,,,,,397,402,,10.1109/coginfocom47531.2019.9089912,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/coginfocom47531.2019.9089912,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BQ2MF,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000582418600069,View Full Record in Web of Science

The machine is no longer a mere tool but a team partner. Both academia and industry are actively investigating human-machine cooperative driving, such as take over, shared control and cooperative driving. However, currently, there is no cooperative driving framework that considers the cognitive characteristics of the interaction between humans and agents. We propose a cooperative interface interaction framework based on human-machine team cognitive information elements that need to be exchanged by both parties in cooperative driving, such as intention, situation awareness, prediction, and their impact on driving tasks. The proposed framework can provide a cognitive dimension for cooperative driving research, which can be used as a reference for the design of interaction in highly automated vehicles.","[Zhang, Jun; Liu, Yujia] Tongji Univ, Coll Design & Innovat, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun; Liu, Yujia; Wang, Jianmin; You, Fang] Tongji Univ, Coll Art & Media, Car Interact Design Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hansen, Preben] Stockholm Univ, Dept Comp & Syst Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Tongji University; Tongji University; Stockholm University,"You, F (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Art & Media, Car Interact Design Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",alexmaya@tongji.edu.cn; liuyujia@tongji.edu.cn; preben@dsv.su.se; wangjianmin@tongj.edu.cn; youfang@tongj.edu.cn,"Liu, Yujia/AHB-9746-2022","wang, jianmin/0000-0001-8703-8973; you, fang/0000-0002-3212-5014; Liu, Yujia/0000-0001-6529-1185",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1004903]; National Social Science Fund [19FYSB040]; Shanghai Automotive Industry Science and Technology Development Foundation [1717]; Excellent Experimental Teaching Project of Tongji University and Graduate Education Research and Reform Project of Tongji University [2020JC35],National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Social Science Fund; Shanghai Automotive Industry Science and Technology Development Foundation; Excellent Experimental Teaching Project of Tongji University and Graduate Education Research and Reform Project of Tongji University,"This work was supported by The National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB1004903), National Social Science Fund (No. 19FYSB040), Shanghai Automotive Industry Science and Technology Development Foundation (No. 1717).

While the interest in Virtual Reality (VR) applications for industrial robotics grows, the question of whether and how senior workers can withstand VR-based repetitive tasks arises. We here aimed to answer such questions by systematically assessing young and senior users' experiential, behavioural, and cognitive factors during simulated robotic teleoperations in VR. Two control systems for VR telerobotics, button- and action-based controls, were employed. Human performance, vigilance, and workload were measured through self-reports and a VR-integrated eye-tracker. Additionally, age-dependent differences in individual cultural and experiential factors were explored via self-report measures. Despite being slower and experiencing increased fatigue under specific conditions, as suggested by the eye-tracking measures, senior users demonstrated comparable precision in operating the robotic arm to their younger counterparts. Notably, both age groups reported similar levels of perceived fatigue. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the advantages and challenges of adopting advanced telerobotics control systems across different age groups, consistently emphasising the human-centered dimension.","[Nenna, Federica; Pluchino, Patrik; Gamberini, Luciano] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Psicol Gen, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Zanardi, Davide] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Psicol Sviluppo & Salute, Padua, Italy; [Nenna, Federica; Pluchino, Patrik; Gamberini, Luciano] Univ Padua, HIT Human Inspired Technol Ctr, Padua, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua,"Nenna, F (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Psicol Gen, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",federica.nenna@unipd.it,"Pluchino, Patrik/HJP-0747-2023; Nenna, Federica/AHA-0172-2022","Pluchino, Patrik/0000-0002-8562-0123; Zanardi, Davide/0009-0004-7714-1060; Nenna, Federica/0000-0003-0353-6014",Horizon,Horizon,No Statement Available,,42,3,3,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-929X,1362-3001,,BEHAV INFORM TECHNOL,Behav.

However, many other works require cognitive knowledge that only humans can provide. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) emerges as an ideal concept of co-working between a human operator and a robot, representing one of the most significant subjects for human-life improvement.The ultimate goal is to achieve physical interaction, where handing over an object plays a crucial role for an effective task accomplishment. Considerable research work had been developed in this particular field in recent years, where several solutions were already proposed. Nonetheless, some particular issues regarding Human-Robot Collaboration still hold an open path to truly important research improvements. This paper provides a literature overview, defining the HRC concept, enumerating the distinct human-robot communication channels, and discussing the physical interaction that this collaboration entails. Moreover, future challenges for a natural and intuitive collaboration are exposed: the machine must behave like a human especially in the pre-grasping/grasping phases and the handover procedure should be fluent and bidirectional, for an articulated function development. These are the focus of the near future investigation aiming to shed light on the complex combination of predictive and reactive control mechanisms promoting coordination and understanding. Following recent progress in artificial intelligence, learning exploration stand as the key element to allow the generation of coordinated actions and their shaping by experience.","[Castro, Afonso; Santos, Vitor] Univ Aveiro, Inst Elect & Informat Engn Aveiro IEETA, Dept Mech Engn DEM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Silva, Filipe] Univ Aveiro, Inst Elect & Informat Engn Aveiro IEETA, Dept Elect Telecommun & Informat DETI, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Castro, A (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Inst Elect & Informat Engn Aveiro IEETA, Dept Mech Engn DEM, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",afonsocastro@ua.pt; fmsilva@ua.pt; vitor@ua.pt,"Silva, Filipe/AAJ-2527-2020; Santos, Vitor/D-2973-2013","Silva, Filipe/0000-0001-6191-0727; Castro, Afonso/0000-0001-9571-9808; Santos, Vitor/0000-0003-1283-7388","Portugal 2020, under the Competitiveness and Internationalization Operational Program, the Lisbon Regional Operational Program [POCI-01-0247-FEDER-046103]; European Regional Development Fund","Portugal 2020, under the Competitiveness and Internationalization Operational Program, the Lisbon Regional Operational Program; European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU))","The present study was developed in the scope of the Project Augmented Humanity [POCI-01-0247-FEDER-046103], financed by Portugal 2020, under the Competitiveness and Internationalization Operational Program, the Lisbon Regional Operational Program, and by the European Regional Development Fund.",,163,35,36,6,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUN,2021,21,12,,,,,,,4113,10.3390/s21124113,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21124113,,,28,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,SZ1LZ,34203766,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-15,WOS:000666337100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For instance, given an AND-gate with 1,000-input pins, it may be described very much differently at various levels of perceptions in the knowledge hierarchy. At the data level on the bottom, it represents a 21,000 state space, known as 'big data' in recent terms, which appears to be a big issue in engineering. However, at the information level, it just represents 1,000 bit information that is equivalent to the numbers of inputs. Further, at the knowledge level, it expresses only two rules that if all inputs are one, the output is one; and if any input is zero, the output is zero. Ultimately, at the intelligence level, it is simply an instance of the logical model of an AND-gate with arbitrary inputs. This problem reveals that human intelligence and wisdom are an extremely efficient and a fast convergent induction mechanism for knowledge and wisdom elicitation and abstraction where data are merely factual materials and arbitrary instances in the almost infinite state space of the real world. Although data and information processing have been relatively well studied, the nature, theories, and suitable mathematics underpinning knowledge and intelligence are yet to be systematically studied in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing. This will leads to a new era of human intelligence revolution following the industrial, computational, and information revolutions. This is also in accordance with the driving force of the hierarchical human needs from low-level material requirements to high-level ones such as knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence. The trend to the emerging intelligent revolution is to meet the ultimate human needs. The basic approach to intelligent revolution is to invent and embody cognitive computers, cognitive robots, and cognitive systems that extend human memory capacity, learning ability, wisdom, and creativity. Via intelligence revolution, an interconnected cognitive intelligent Internet will enable ordinary people to access highly intelligent systems created based on the latest development of human knowledge and wisdom. Highly professional systems may help people to solve typical everyday problems.

However, industrial usability is still focused on performance although high performance is not necessarily a goal in actual games. Mobile gamers largely want to increase their hedonic satisfaction. So already established usability guidelines can fail in mobile gaming. Focusing on vibrations as a haptic feedback, this study analyzed the influences of intensity and length of vibrations on user perceptions based on the technology acceptance model aiming for hedonic satisfaction when mobile gaming. A smartphone game was modified to generate seven types of vibrations for a human factors experiment with 70 subjects and administered a questionnaire to measure their perceptions of the game influenced by the vibrations. The results show that including vibrations significantly increases the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and cognitive concentration in the game. The stronger vibration intensity significantly improves user perceptions of the usefulness and cognitive concentration, whereas the length of vibration is not a critical factor as long as vibrations exist.","[Choe, Pilsung] Qatar Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Schumacher, Dennis] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Fac Mech Engn, Aachen, Germany",Qatar University; RWTH Aachen University,"Choe, P (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",pchoe@qu.edu.qa,,,,,,,30,12,13,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1044-7318,1532-7590,,INT J HUM-COMPUT INT,Int.

The present research investigates how contributors' metacognition or self-beliefs, combine with others' views of themselves to inform collective team states related to learning about other agents (i.e., transactive memory systems) and forming social attachments with other agents (i.e., collective team identification), both important teamwork states that have implications for team collective intelligence. We test the predictions in a longitudinal study with 78 teams. Additionally, we provide interview data from industry experts in human-artificial intelligence teams. Our findings contribute to an emerging socio-cognitive architecture for COllective HUman-MAchine INtelligence (i.e., COHUMAIN) by articulating its underpinnings in individual and collective cognition and metacognition.

The key to a successful teleoperation robot system is the delicate design of the human-robot interface that helps strengthen the human operator's situational awareness. Traditional human-robot interface for robotic teleoperation is usually based on imagery data (e.g., video streaming), causing the limited field of view (FOV) and increased cognitive burden for processing additional spatial information. As a result, 3D scene reconstruction methods based on point cloud models captured by scanning technologies (e.g., depth camera and LiDAR) have been explored to provide immersive and intuitive feedback to the human operator. Despite the added benefits of applying reconstructed 3D scenes in telerobotic systems, challenges still present. Most 3D reconstruction methods utilize raw point cloud data due to the difficulty of real-time model rendering. The significant size of point cloud data makes the processing and transfer between robots and human operators difficult and slow. In addition, most reconstructed point cloud models do not contain physical properties such as weight and colliders. A more enriched control mechanism based on physics engine simulations is impossible. This paper presents an intelligent robot teleoperation interface that collects, processes, transfers, and reconstructs the immersive scene model of the workspace in Virtual Reality (VR) and enables intuitive robot controls accordingly. The proposed system, Telerobotic Operation based on Auto-reconstructed Remote Scene (TOARS), utilizes a deep learning algorithm to automatically detect objects in the captured scene, along with their physical properties, based on the point cloud data. The processed information is then transferred to the game engine where rendered virtual objects replace the original point cloud models in the VR environment. TOARS is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of 3D scene reconstruction and situational awareness of human operators in robotic teleoperation.","[Zhou, Tianyu; Zhu, Qi] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 454A Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Du, Jing] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",zhoutianyu@ufl.edu; qizhu@ufl.edu; eric.du@essie.ufl.edu,"Zhou, Tianyu/IYJ-7379-2023; Du, Jing/AHE-6199-2022; Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024",,National Science Foundation (NSF) [1937053]; Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities [1937053] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"This material is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant 1937053.

This research investigated how deploying a user interface utilizing a 2-D and 3-D display affects participants' cognitive effort, task performance, trust, and situational awareness while performing a collaborative task using a robot. The study used a within-subject design where fifteen participants were subjected to three conditions: no interface, display User Interface, and mixed reality User Interface where vision assistance was provided. Participants performed a pick-and-place task with a robot in each condition under two levels of cognitive workload (i.e., high and low). The cognitive workload was measured using subjective (i.e., NASA TLX) and objective measures (i.e., heart rate variability). Additionally, task performance, situation awareness, and trust when using these interfaces were measured to understand the impact of different user interfaces during a Human-Robot Collaboration task. Findings from this study indicated that cognitive workload and user interfaces impacted task performance, where a significant decrease in efficiency and accuracy was observed while using the mixed reality interface. Additionally, irrespective of the three conditions, all participants perceived the task as more cognitively demanding during the high cognitive workload session. However, no signifcant differences across the interfaces were observed. Finally, cognitive workload impacted situational awareness and trust, where lower levels were reported in the high cognitive workload session, and the lowest levels were observed under the mixed reality user interface condition.","[Kalatzis, Apostolos; Rahman, Saidur; Stanley, Laura; Wittie, Mike] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Prabhu, Vishnunarayan Girishan] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Kalatzis, A (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",apostoloskalatzis@smontana.edu; vgirisha@charlotte.edu; saidurrahman@montana.edu; Laura.stanley@montana.edu; mike.wittie@montana.edu,"Girishan Prabhu, Vishnunarayan/AAE-5876-2021","Girishan Prabhu, Vishnunarayan/0000-0001-5410-9894; Wittie, Mike/0000-0002-3752-2430; Kalatzis, Apostolos/0000-0002-1519-2207",National Science Foundation [1900704],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Science Foundation under award number 1900704.,,87,0,0,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0055-2,,,,2023,,,,,,,5,14,,10.1145/3577190.3614112,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3577190.3614112,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW4GP,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001147764700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in small-batch and highly customized assembly tasks, frequently changes in production procedures pose significant cognition challenges. To address this, leveraging computer vision technology to enhance human cognition becomes a feasible solution. Therefore, this review aims to explore the cognitive characteristics of human beings and classify existing computer vision technologies in a manner that discusses the future development of cognition-augmented human-centric assembly. The concept of cognition-augmented assembly is first proposed based on the brain's functional structure - the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Corresponding to these brain regions, cognitive issues in spatiality, memory, knowledge, and decision-making are summarized. Recent studies conducted between 2014 and 2023 on visual computation of assembly are categorized into four groups: position registration, multi-layer recognition, contextual perception, and mixed-reality fusion, all aimed at addressing these cognitive challenges. The applications and limitations of current computer vision technology are discussed. Furthermore, considering the rapidly evolving technologies such as the metaverse, cloud services, large language models, and brain-computer interfaces, future trends on computer vision are prospected to augment human cognition corresponding to the cognitive issues.","[Pang, Jiazhen; Zheng, Pai; Fan, Junming; Liu, Tianyuan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Zheng, P (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",pai.zheng@polyu.edu.hk,"Tianyuan, Liu/GPF-5812-2022; Fan, Junming/ABE-3269-2020; ZHENG, PAI/K-7989-2012","ZHENG, PAI/0000-0002-2329-8634","General Research Fund [PolyU15210222, PolyU15206723]; Research Grants Council (RGC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","General Research Fund; Research Grants Council (RGC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","This work is partially funded by the grants from the General Research Fund (Project No PolyU15210222, PolyU15206723) , Research Grants Council (RGC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.",,168,0,0,20,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

In this work, a platform that extends the aforementioned concepts with ones coming from Industry 5.0 like reconciliation and collaboration between humans and machines is introduced. The proposed platform provides defect detection and localization services for hard metal industry by extending current AI solutions with exponentially growing technologies such as interpretable and explainable AI (XAI), human-in-the-loop (HITL) approaches and cognitive retraining mechanisms. In particular, the platform, that is built on a micro-service architecture to enable its software sustainability, is powered by machine and deep learning models for defect detection and localization. These models are able to recognize the defects, locate them with high precision and present them to end users so to maximize resiliency in quality inspection processes. Alongside the state-of-the-art AI algorithms that are utilized by the platform, the human in the loop mechanisms and interfaces that enable human experts to inject their knowledge for AI models training are considered as key innovative aspects of this work. To enhance further the human and AI collaboration, XAI mechanisms are included in the platform,to enable the experts to gain useful insights regarding the operation of the AI models in order to be able to provide further feedback that can trigger on-the-fly platform's cognition mechanisms to improve models' accuracy and performance.","[Kotsiopoulos, Thanasis; Papakostas, Gerasimos; Vafeiadis, Thanasis; Dimitriadis, Vasileios; Nizamis, Alexandros; Ioannidis, Dimosthenis; Votis, Konstantinos; Tzovaras, Dimitrios] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Informat Technol Inst, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Kotsiopoulos, Thanasis; Sarigiannidis, Panagiotis] Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Karamanli & Ligeris St, Kozani 50100, Greece; [Bolzoni, Andrea; Bellinati, Davide] Bonfiglioli Slovakia sro, Povazska Bystrica 01701, Slovakia",Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; University of Western Macedonia,"Kotsiopoulos, T (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Informat Technol Inst, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece.;Kotsiopoulos, T (corresponding author), Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Karamanli & Ligeris St, Kozani 50100, Greece.",kotsiopoulos@iti.gr; gpapakos@iti.gr; thanvaf@iti.gr; dimvasdim@iti.gr; alnizami@iti.gr; andrea.bolzoni@bonfiglioli.com; davide.bellinati@bonfiglioli.com; djoannid@iti.gr; kvotis@iti.gr; dimitrios.tzovaras@iti.gr; p.sarigiannidis@uowm.gr,"Ioannidis, Dimosthenis/J-2333-2019","Dimitriadis, Vasileios/0009-0001-8880-119X; Kotsiopoulos, Thanasis/0000-0001-5178-3840; Nizamis, Alexandros/0000-0002-6954-4861",European Union [957331-KNOWLEDGE],European Union(European Union (EU)),This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programmes under grant agreement No. 957331-KNOWLEDGE.

The results indicate that the proposed assembly skill transfer system can considerably improve novice operators' assembly performance.","[Duan, Feng; Zhang, Zhao] Nankai Univ, Coll Comp & Control Engn, Dept Automat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Gao, Qi] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Arai, Tamio] Shibaura Inst Technol, Tokyo 1358548, Japan",Nankai University; Nankai University; Shibaura Institute of Technology,"Duan, F (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Coll Comp & Control Engn, Dept Automat, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",duanf@nankai.edu.cn; 1424099400@qq.com; nkgaoqi@nankai.edu.cn; arai-t@shibaura-it.ac.jp,,,"Research Fellowship for International Young Scientists [61550110251]; Key Technologies R&D Program of Tianjin [14ZCZDSY00008, 14RCGFGX00848]; Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology [14JCYBJC18300]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry [[2012] 940]","Research Fellowship for International Young Scientists; Key Technologies R&D Program of Tianjin; Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars)","This work was supported in part by the Research Fellowship for International Young Scientists under Grant 61550110251, in part by the Key Technologies R&D Program of Tianjin under Grants 14ZCZDSY00008 and 14RCGFGX00848, in part by the Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology under Grant 14JCYBJC18300, and in part by the Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry under Grant [2012] 940.",,22,3,3,0,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2379-8920,2379-8939,,IEEE T COGN DEV SYST,IEEE Trans.

It is often noted how advances in educational attainment in childhood and adolescence may contribute to these historical improvements in cognitive aging. Less is known about the role of work environment in adulthood. Over the last century, work demands and characteristics have been changing profoundly, particularly with shifts from a manufacturing to a service and technical economy. In this article, we used data from the Seattle Longitudinal Study to compare age-related trajectories of cognitive change in five primary mental abilities between earlier-born (1901-1938) and later-born cohorts (1939-1966). Cohorts were matched on an observation-by-observation basis using age and retest, and analyses controlled for participants' gender and number of data points provided. We found that (a) later-born cohorts had higher levels of performance on most cognitive tasks and exhibited less age-related declines in word fluency; (b) later-born cohorts had more enriched perceived work environments, as indicated by higher levels of worker control and innovation, with no cohort differences in work autonomy; (c) these experiences were associated with higher levels of cognitive performance at age 55 years; (d) the effects of perceived work environment were independent of education; and (e) the effects of perceived work environment were consistent across cohorts. The findings suggest that perceived work environment is associated with cognitive functioning independently of education and invariably across historical time. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying these associations.","[Huelur, Gizem] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Huelur, Gizem] Univ Zurich, Univ Res Prior Program Dynam Hlth Aging, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ram, Nilam; Gerstorf, Denis] Penn State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Willis, Sherry L.; Schaie, K.

In light of the above, the purpose of this paper is to explore the potentialities and limitations of service robots in the hospitality industry. To this end, this paper uses a conceptual approach based on a literature review. As a result, we found that in contexts of high customer contact, service robots should be considered to perform standardized tasks due to social/emotional and cognitive/analytical complexity. The hospitality industry is therefore considered closely related to empathic intelligence, as the integration of service robots has not yet reached the desired stage of service delivery. In a seemingly far-fetched context of our reality, organizations will have to decide whether the AI will allow the complete replacement of humans with robots capable of performing the necessary cognitive and emotional tasks. Or investing in balanced capacities by integrating robot-human systems that seems a reasonable option these days.","[Rosete, Ana; Soares, Barbara; Salvadorinho, Juliana; Reis, Joao; Amorim, Marlene] Aveiro Univ, GOVCOPP, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Reis, J (corresponding author), Aveiro Univ, GOVCOPP, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, Aveiro, Portugal.",anarosete@ua.pt; barbaramsoares@ua.pt; juliana.salvadorinho@ua.pt; reis.joao@ua.pt; mamorim@ua.pt,"Salvadorinho, Juliana/AAD-7914-2021; Amorim, Marlene/G-6867-2019; Reis, Joao Carlos Goncalves dos/L-6686-2017","Reis, Joao Carlos Goncalves dos/0000-0002-8504-0065; Salvadorinho, Juliana/0000-0001-8424-9310; Amorim, Marlene/0000-0002-0901-0614",,,,,48,34,35,11,62,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-1348,1865-1356,978-3-030-38724-2; 978-3-030-38723-5,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2020,377,,,,,,174,186,,10.1007/978-3-030-38724-2_13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38724-2_13,,,13,"Business; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science,BR5EJ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000654630700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Study 1 (n=80) consisted of low-wage food manufacturing employees working full time, while Study 2 (n=331) was consisted of a larger, heterogeneous sample of full-time workers representing multiple occupations. Respondents were surveyed on financial insecurity, work-to-family conflict (WFC), stress, and health outcomes at two time periods, 3months apart. Results across our studies provided support for the direct effects of financial insecurity on WFC and stress. In addition, appraisals of WFC and stress serve as significant mediators of the relationship between financial insecurity and health outcomes, including a significant overall lagged effect across time, and perceived stress accounting for the largest proportion of variance in the lagged relationship among Time 1 financial insecurity and Time 2 health outcomes. Besides support for conservation of resources and cognitive appraisal theories, practically, our studies suggest that workplace initiatives to reduce financial insecurity could positively influence employees' work-family, stress, and health experiences. Practitioner points When workers experience financial insecurity, it can have detrimental effects on their health. The effect of financial insecurity on worker health appears to occur because of increased work-family conflict and stress associated with financial insecurity. Direct interventions related to addressing financial insecurity may be challenging, but data suggest there may be a meaningful return-on-investment.","[Odle-Dusseau, Heather N.] Gettysburg Coll, 300 North Washington St,Box 395, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA; [Matthews, Russell A.] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Wayne, Julie H.] Wake Forest Univ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Gettysburg College; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Wake Forest University,"Odle-Dusseau, HN (corresponding author), Gettysburg Coll, 300 North Washington St,Box 395, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA.",hodle@gettysburg.edu,,"Wayne, Julie/0000-0002-0008-5927",,,,,60,35,49,7,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0963-1798,2044-8325,,J OCCUP ORGAN PSYCH,J.

While much is understood about the technical and economic challenges to be overcome for widespread adoption of robotics, less is known about the human barriers to adoption, and much less is summarized. Considering the amount of human cooperation required by existing robotic applications, a comprehensive review of barriers that are cognitive or perceptual in nature using a systematic literature assessment methodology is warranted. However, such a review is not straightforward to design. While matters of cognition and perception as pertinent to construction and automation may be queried directly from the literature, there is no certainty that a review based on directly querying abstract phenomena (i.e., perception) could be comprehensive. Thus, systematically reviewing this topic calls for a robust methodology for the design of database queries. In this paper, we perform text analysis with the quanteda package for R in order to (1) understand the language composition of an initial review corpus, and (2) with that understanding design further queries to capture additional articles otherwise not possible through standard query design. Findings indicate that performing text analysis on a systematic review design can produce valuable insight into a review corpus and inform queries that capture additional unique literature relevant to the review.","[Seh-Taylor, Edward; McCarty, Christopher] Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Sam, Mahya; Franz, Bryan] Univ Florida, ME Rinker Sr Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Seh-Taylor, E (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",esehtaylor@ufl.edu; ufchris@ufl.edu; msam@ufl.edu; bfranz@ufl.edu,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,0,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8396-1,,,,2022,,,,,,,718,726,,,,,,9,"Engineering, Aerospace; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Computer Science,BS8SX,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000776568400075,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the theoretical approaches of competence management a process model is derived in order to seize reasonable activities to build a competence base for digitalized companies. The model was refined and pre-tested in a joint research project with scientific and industrial partners and then tested in a quantitative study among German component manufacturers of the capital-goods industry. Drawing upon a sample of 284 data sets, our results reveal that high developed cognitive and processual competences of individuals support the digital transformation of a firm. Surprisingly, social competences have only little influence.

Furthermore, it becomes possible to incorporate human expertise into the DT ecosystem by adopting an ontological approach. The CDT enhances DT services with advanced reasoning capabilities, leading to a profound semantic enrichment of the data. The presented methodology has been validated using a use case where the CDT is employed to detect malfunctions, significantly reducing manual intervention.

Results showed that the two components of SWB predicted job performance over the four years. Additionally, when the two components are entered in a regression equation the validity increases over time as a consequence of a suppressor effect on the cognitive component of SWB.

They allow to combine the advantages of robots, which enjoy high levels of accuracy, speed and repeatability, with the flexibility and cognitive skills of human workers. However, to achieve an efficient human-robot collaboration, several challenges need to be tackled. First, a safe interaction must be guaranteed to prevent harming humans having a direct contact with the moving robot. Additionally, to take full advantage of human skills, it is important that intuitive user interfaces are properly designed, so that human operators can easily program and interact with the robot.

In this paper, a workshop digital twin model construction method based on group systems cognition (GSC) is proposed, aiming to realize the overall cognition of workshop production process in multiple layers from low-level physical subsystem to high-level group systems. Combining digital twin technology with the general cognitive principles of human problem solving in cognitive science, a workshop digital twin model framework including physical layer, virtual layer and cognitive layer is established; then, a multi-level cognitive computing model with sustainable learning capability was constructed by using information technology, so that the workshop twin model has cognitive capability. Finally, the application validation of the GSC-based workshop twin was carried out in an aerospace structural component manufacturing workshop as art example, and it was verified that GSC can endow the workshop twin with certain cognitive ability and effectively improve the workshop productivity.","[Li, Enming; Zhou, Jingtao; Wang, Mingwei; Zhang, Shusheng; Jiang, Tengyuan] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Zhou, JT (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",zhoujt@nwpu.edu.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB1710300],National Key R&D Program of China,This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No.2020YFB1710300).,,10,0,0,4,19,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,979-8-3503-4839-2,,,,2023,,,,,,,452,457,,10.1109/VRW58643.2023.00098,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VRW58643.2023.00098,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BV1LG,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000990508800083,View Full Record in Web of Science

As these changes have been revealed by standardized laboratory tests, it remains unclear how much they affect older persons' performance in industrial workplace tasks. The present study therefore compared young and older participants in a task modeled after a complex, realistic industrial workplace scenario, and additionally assessed motor, cognitive and mental variables that might have an impact on overall task efficiency. 25 participants (13 young, mean age 25 years; 12 older participants, mean age 65 years) sat in front of a panel with multiple displays - indicating the momentary state of a simulated nuclear power plant (i.e., power supply and demand, fuel rod stock, temperature) - and multiple actuators - allowing them to modify that state. Their task was to maximize the plant's momentary earnings, which were displayed as well. Participants could increase the earnings by keeping the difference between power supply and demand as small as possible, and to sufficiently use the fuel rod stocks since they did cost earnings. Operator efficiency was defined as final earnings after 8.7 min of work. Kinematics and dynamics of grasping the actuators were assessed with a motion capture system and force sensors. Workload and strain was assessed with established questionnaires, and cognitive abilities with PC-based tests. We found that operator efficiency dramatically declined in older age (-70%). This decline was not related to differences in grasping kinetics and kinematics, workload, or cognition, but was related to the age-related decay of motivation, suggesting reduced motivation as one explanatory factor. We therefore conclude that performance on a simulated complex industrial workplace task is partially dependent of age and motivation, but is difficult to predict from other motor or mental functions. This conclusion is relevant for the assessment of industrial job skills, and possibly also of driving and household skills. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a state-of-the-art review was conducted on PWB constructs and the associated theoretical perspectives. This review of theories and dimensions aims to provide a more complete account of the factors associated with PWB and provide more systemic guidance for organizations. Drawing on a three-dimensional taxonomy of PWB in social science literature, this study identified five themes of PWB antecedents in the construction community: motivational, relational, working environment, personal attributes, and social cognitive. Findings in this study could contribute to both PWB theory development and management practices. Theoretically, this review introduced more clarity to PWB theories in the construction literature, linking different dimensions of PWB constructs with their antecedents. This also allows for identifying future research avenues to expand the boundaries of the existing body of knowledge. Practically, management practices are offered to support management, policy makers, and decision makers to optimize and improve health and well-being strategies in the construction industry.","[Li, Keyao; Sheng, Zitong; Griffin, Mark A.] Curtin Univ, Future Work Inst, Perth, WA 6000, Australia; [Wang, Dan] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Zitong] Univ Auckland, Sch Psychol, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",Curtin University; Chongqing University; University of Auckland,"Wang, D (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",keyao.li@curtin.edu.au; wangxiaodan@cqu.edu.cn; zitong.sheng@curtin.edu.au; mark.griffin@curtin.edu.au,"Griffin, Mark/AFS-9946-2022","Sheng, Zitong/0000-0002-5122-3226; LI, Keyao/0000-0002-6220-7459; Wang, Dan/0000-0003-0076-2534",Chongqing Social Science Plan Project [~2021BS081]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [~2021M700576],Chongqing Social Science Plan Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This work was supported by the Chongqing Social Science Plan Project (Grant No.~2021BS081) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No.~2021M700576).,,160,21,21,6,57,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0742-597X,1943-5479,,J MANAGE ENG,J.

Thus, this study will address several points of the boiler operator's activity, in order to solve the proposed demand (skeletal muscle issue and productivity). Methods: An ergonomic analysis was performed divided in three phases. The first phase (generalist) was a collection of data about the company, the specific function and the sector that makes up the function (general organization, tasks and production). In the second phase, a pre-diagnosis of the analyzed function was presented. Finally, ergonomic evaluation methods (interview, real analysis, application of ergonomic tool) were applied to confront the initial demand. After this, in the third phase, a final diagnosis and recommendations were made to adapt the current situation of the activities. Results: The company evaluated has around 370 employees, including the production, recycling and reuse of paper sector. The evaluated sector (Boiler) has six active employees, in three shifts (two employees per shift). The development of the work focused on the boiler operator was informed about the issues involving the boiler-to-gas exchange by the steam boiler.

Through the data passed by the company, there was a possible pre-diagnosis focused on cognitive and musculoskeletal issues (demand from employee reports about function).

As a basis of the mutual empathy, the understanding of a human operator's intention has been primarily studied through the technique of human action recognition. Existing deep learning -based methods demonstrate remarkable efficacy in handling information -rich data such as physiological measurements and videos, where the latter category represents a more natural perception input. However, deploying these methods in new unseen assembly scenarios requires first collecting abundant case -specific data. This leads to significant manual effort and poor flexibility. To deal with the issue, this paper proposes a novel cross -domain few -shot learning method for data -efficient multimodal human action recognition. A hierarchical data fusion mechanism is designed to jointly leverage the skeletons, RGB images and depth maps with complementary information. Then a temporal CrossTransformer is developed to enable the action recognition with very limited amount of data. Lightweight domain adapters are integrated to further improve the generalization with fast finetuning. Extensive experiments on a real car engine assembly case show the superior performance of proposed method over state-of-the-art regarding both accuracy and finetuning efficiency. Real-time demonstrations and ablation study further indicate the potential of early recognition, which is beneficial for the robot procedures generation in practical applications. In summary, this paper contributes to the rarely explored realm of data -efficient human action recognition for proactive human-robot collaboration.","[Wang, Tianyu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, UM SJTU Joint Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhihao; Wang, Lihui; Wang, Xi Vincent] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Li, Mian] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Global Inst Future Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Royal Institute of Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Wang, XV (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Stockholm, Sweden.",wangxi@kth.se,"Liu, Zhihao/R-8927-2018; Wang, Lihui/O-3907-2014; Wang, Xi Vincent/O-4662-2014","Wang, Xi Vincent/0000-0001-9694-0483",EU H2020 ODIN project [101017141]; China Scholarship Council [202206230163]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [101017141] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,EU H2020 ODIN project; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership),This research was supported by the EU H2020 ODIN project (Grant Agreement: 101017141) and China Scholarship Council (No.: 202206230163) .,,54,1,1,18,18,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

We employ Electroencephalography (EEG) and Eye tracking instrumentation to measure human affect in a series of simulated drone piloting experiments to examine performance using behavioral variables, controller input variables, as well as measures of individual cognitive ability. Current results show that task difficulty impacts the performance/learning process and varies by the nature of the task. The behavioral and biometric measures associated with performance/learning varied significantly among activities. We conclude that drone specifications and training requirements can and should be calibrated to the drone mission. In addition to developing specifications and training requirements, psychological and behavioral measures can also serve as theoretical foundations for modeling complex tasks.","[Dalilian, Fatemeh] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Nembhard, David] Univ Iowa, Ind & Syst Engn, Iowa City, IA USA; [Nembhard, David] Univ Iowa, Business Analyt, Iowa City, IA USA",University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Iowa,"Dalilian, F (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",fatemeh-dalilian@uiowa.edu,,"Nembhard, David/0000-0003-2262-6840; Dalilian, Fatemeh/0000-0002-4173-3345",,,,,126,2,3,3,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1044-7318,1532-7590,,INT J HUM-COMPUT INT,Int.

J,"Village, J; Salustri, FA; Neumann, WP",,,,"Village, J.; Salustri, F. A.; Neumann, W. P.",,,Using action research to develop human factors approaches to improve assembly quality during early design and ramp-up of an assembly line,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Human factors; Ergonomics; Production assembly design; Quality improvement; Design for assembly; House of quality,INTEGRATING HUMAN-FACTORS; ERGONOMICS; WORK; PERFORMANCE,"Engineers at a large electronics new product initiation site were interested in developing human factors (HF) approaches to help improve assembly quality during two stages of their production assembly design: early design of tasks, fixtures and tooling; and during early ramp-up of new assembly lines at outsourcing sites. Researchers worked in an action research approach with company engineers and ergonomists to integrate HF into both design stages. This paper presents the human factors approaches and discusses the challenges of using human factors to improve assembly quality. For the first stage of early design, a HF-design for assembly (HF-DFA) scorecard was developed with 22 items scored on a 0 (no risk or problem) to 2 (high risk or problems) scale. Items included physical risks, such as grip size and force, movement risks, such as re-grasping or re-orienting, visual risks, such as visual accuracy and inspection difficulty, and cognitive issues such as ability to detect a problem and risk of damage to part or component. High scores were associated with assembly tasks that were both reported as difficult by operators, and also had quality problems. The HF-DFA was adopted as a controlled engineering document and used to proactively score assembly tasks prior to final design of tasks, fixtures and tooling. In the second stage of early ramp, researchers combined the HF-DFA and other HF and performance-based metrics into a modified HF-house of quality (HF-HoQ) approach where the focus was on worker requirements rather than the traditional customer requirements. The HF-HoQwas evaluated using video of four identical tasks performed at different outsourcing locations that had a seven-fold difference in defect rates. The HF-HoQ successfully detected the site with the highest defect rate, but not the lowest. The authors recommend further testing and development of approaches that attempt to bring insight from HF to the issue of improving assembly quality. Relevance to industry: Human factors is broader than injury prevention, and has been linked to assembly quality. Two HF approaches were developed to help improve quality in early design stages and during early ramp-up of assembly lines. Companies are encouraged to develop and evaluate HF approaches for improving assembly quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Village, J.; Salustri, F. A.; Neumann, W.

The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as CNC machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers; that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins to solve surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical system-friendly big data is a critical issue. However, preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for digital twins' input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human- and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method. The method will be extended to the manufacturing processes in the next phase of this study.","[Fattahi, Saman; Okamoto, Takuya] Kitami Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn, 165 Koen Cho, Kitami, Hokkaido 0908507, Japan; [Ura, Sharifu] Kitami Inst Technol, Div Mech & Elect Engn, 165 Koen Cho, Kitami, Hokkaido 0908507, Japan",Kitami Institute of Technology; Kitami Institute of Technology,"Ura, S (corresponding author), Kitami Inst Technol, Div Mech & Elect Engn, 165 Koen Cho, Kitami, Hokkaido 0908507, Japan.",d2071308012@std.kitami-it.ac.jp; m2052100060@std.kitami-it.ac.jp; ullah@mail.kitami-it.ac.jp,"Ura, Sharifu/D-7755-2013; Fattahi, Saman/AAT-7230-2020","Ura, Sharifu/0000-0003-4584-5288; Fattahi, Saman/0000-0002-3355-1576; Okamoto, Takuya/0000-0002-3747-8214",,,,,52,7,7,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-2289,,BIG DATA COGN COMPUT,Big Data Cogn.

Reducing loss incidents in the process industry requires increasingly knowledgeable operators to access multiple sources of current and historic data through industrial informatics. To evaluate the effectiveness of new designs and design features, clear criteria for performance and performance improvements must be developed. The situational design model was developed to assess and develop problem solving skills, the higher cognitive processes necessary for high performing operators to employ in abnormal situations. The situational design model recognizes learner readiness and the disambiguation of recurrent' and non-recurrent skills. In this paper, the situational design model is demonstrated in a workplace-analogous study to evaluate the effectiveness of Distributed Control System interface adaptation. This type of structured assessment can be used to tie design features more directly to the specific skills of interest and improve the value propositions for new features and designs. The demonstration in this study shows the possibilities for structured assessment and suggests next steps toward aligning business and operations objectives with design evaluation techniques.","[Naef, Michelle; Lefsrud, Lianne] Univ Alberta, Fac Engn, Lynch Sch Engn Safety & Risk Management, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Naef, M (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Fac Engn, Lynch Sch Engn Safety & Risk Management, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",naef@ualberta.ca; lefsrud@ualberta.ca,"Lefsrud, Lianne/KUP-8682-2024","Naef, Michelle/0000-0002-7811-7159",NSERC [RGPIN-2018-1509-Lefsrud],NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research is funded by NSERC RGPIN-2018-1509-Lefsrud Developing Safety Management Systems (SMS) Models.,,46,0,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-4230,1873-3352,,J LOSS PREVENT PROC,J.

Despite its success, many HC projects struggle to expand their user base and create sustained user engagement. In contrast, the commercial video game industry overall is very successful at encouraging users to spend significant time and resources to play over extended stretches of time, using techniques such as gameplay loops to engage players on many levels. When integrating scientific research into a video game, ideally the HC activities fit naturally within the gameplay loops and overall game themes, which game developers are best suited to accomplish. The authors propose a new HC to Video Games (HCtVG) model and associated framework, which provides a common means to connect HC research and video game developers. The HCtVG model comprises two major phases: Deconstruction and Analysis (DA) done by the researchers, and Game Integration (GI) completed by the game developers. During the DA, researchers deconstruct their research into a 5-Step Analysis Structure (5SAS) consisting of Suggest, Validate, Process, Select, and Exit steps. The 5SAS allows game developers to perform the GI phase, using the guidelines provided to integrate the HC activity into the gameplay and theme. This structure allows scientists to focus on their domain expertise while leveraging the skills of the game development community to design their video game integration. To demonstrate the HCtVG model, the authors apply the DA phase to an HC project seeking the discovery of chemotherapeutic co medication properties for multi-drug resistant cancer research, and use the GI phase to design and integrate the HC activity into the popular game Minecraft.","[Clark, Corey; Ouellette, Myque] Southern Methodist Univ, SMU Guildhall, Comp Sci & Engn, Dallas, TX 75205 USA; [Greenberg, Ira] Southern Methodist Univ, Ctr Creat Comp, Dallas, TX USA",Southern Methodist University; Southern Methodist University,"Clark, C (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, SMU Guildhall, Comp Sci & Engn, Dallas, TX 75205 USA.",coreyc@smu.edu; igreenberg@smu.edu; myque@smu.edu,,,Balanced Media\Technology,Balanced Media\Technology,This work was partially supported by Balanced Media vertical bar Technology.,,31,2,2,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2330-5649,,978-1-5386-6298-4,IEEE INT CONF SERIOU,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Medical Informatics; Rehabilitation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Medical Informatics; Rehabilitation,BQ3RS,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000587893500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, robots are often programmed by robot experts rather than the operators effectively working with the machine. Therefore, operators may perceive low levels of task autonomy due to the unpredictability of robot motions. Empowering operators to make their own choices regarding robot motions can improve such feelings. However, research in cognitive science shows that allowing operators to decide on robot motions in a collaborative task could be influenced by how people consider their travel path and their partner's action. To better understand these relations, considering preliminary results from a previous study, we designed a user study where we tested operators' decisions in a collaborative task where groups of robot experts and novices were asked to choose their preferred task configuration among four possible options that differed in terms of operators' physical ergonomics and robot travel path. Our results show that robotic experts prioritize joint team work rather than their ergonomics. Contrarily, novices prioritize individual efforts and tend to reduce the robot travel path while keeping their travel path constant, maintaining good physical ergonomics. In conclusion, providing operators with task decision autonomy can be advantageous, but operator background must be considered to ensure optimal physical ergonomics and travel paths.","[Pantano, Matteo; Regulin, Daniel; Kamps, Tobias] Siemens Aktiengesell, Technol Dept, D-81739 Munich, Germany; [Pantano, Matteo] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Human Ctr Assist Robot, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Curioni, Arianna; Lee, Dongheui] Tech Univ Wien, Inst Comp Tech, Autonomous Syst, AT-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Lee, Dongheui] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Robot & Mechatron, D-82234 Wessling, Germany",Siemens AG; Siemens Germany; Technical University of Munich; Technische Universitat Wien; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Pantano, M (corresponding author), Siemens Aktiengesell, Technol Dept, D-81739 Munich, Germany.;Pantano, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Human Ctr Assist Robot, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",matteo.pantano@siemens.com,"Curioni, Arianna/ABF-2982-2021","Pantano, Matteo/0000-0002-5420-0038",European Commission [873087]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SPP 2134]; Siemens AG; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [873087] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Siemens AG(Siemens AG); H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership),"This work is partially supported by: Siemens AG, the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme with the project SHOP4CF under grant agreement No. 873087 and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft with the project SPP 2134.",,50,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2164-0572,,979-8-3503-0327-8,IEEE-RAS INT C HUMAN,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/HUMANOIDS57100.2023.10375163,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HUMANOIDS57100.2023.10375163,,,8,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BW4YC,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001156965200024,View Full Record in Web of Science

After considering the framework's origins, this paper reviews its progress, predictably covering experimental research on ecological interface design, case studies of the application of CWA to human factors and engineering problems in industry, and methods and modelling tools for CWA. Emphasis is placed, however, on studying the nexus between some of the recent results obtained with CWA and the original field studies of human problem solving that motivated the framework's development. Of particular interest is a case study of the use of CWA for military doctrine development, a problem commonly regarded as lying outside the fields of human factors and engineering. It is concluded that the value of CWA, even for such diverse problems, is likely to result from its conceptual grounding in empirical observations of patterns of human reasoning in complex systems.

Although in the construction industry the competency requirements for mid- and upper-level employees are very well defined, such clear definitions at the workers' level are missing. Literature suggests that along with practical skills, workers require additional socioemotional, cognitive, and technical competencies to perform their work efficiently. Therefore, through a nationwide survey of 598 industrial professionals in India, 6, 9, and 13 competencies were identified for unskilled, semiskilled, and skilled categories of workers, respectively. These competencies included attitude, motivation, and physical strength for unskilled workers; self-confidence and technical knowledge for semiskilled workers; and writing, reading, mathematical, and problem-solving skills for skilled workers. These results will have threefold implications. First, they will assist training providers designing an effective worker training program. Second, they will help the development of a career progression path for the workers. Third, if the identified competencies are considered in workers' categorization process, then the latter will become more robust than the existing one, in which only practical skills are considered.","[Johari, Sparsh; Jha, Kumar Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Johari, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India.",sparshjo@gmail.com; knjha@civil.iitd.ac.in,"jha, kumar neeraj/ITV-1048-2023; Johari, Sparsh/AAR-8823-2020","Johari, Sparsh/0000-0002-1396-0188",,,,,57,11,11,6,42,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

While many studies have examined the hazard identification skills of workers, researchers have not yet explored how the dynamic nature of hazards impacts workers' hazard anticipation, hazard identification, and cognitive perception of hazards within dynamic construction scenarios. This study investigates (1) whether hazard characteristics (i.e., static versus dynamic) impact workers' hazard identification performance; and (2) how two cognitive steps (i.e., attention and perception) influence hazard identification performance for these dynamic hazards. Employing state-of-the-art 360 degrees video panoramas, this study performed an empirical investigation experiment to assess 30 construction workers' hazard identification skills and corresponding attention and perception behaviors. The results of this study indicate that worker's hazard identification abilities are affected by the static and/or dynamic nature of hazards: Generally, workers better anticipate dynamic hazards thanks to target and context anticipatory cues. In addition, a major discriminator between workers with higher hazard identification skills and those with lower hazard identification skills for dynamic hazards manifested in their continuous awareness of hazardous situations and proper prediction of emerging or potential hazards. Beyond identifying these factors, this study discusses multiple reasons underpinning attentional failures and misperception. The study highlights the importance of applying an integrated personalized training program to address cognitive failures and hazard anticipation skills to improve occupational safety in the construction industry.","[Lee, Kyeongsuk; Hasanzadeh, Sogand] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hasanzadeh, Sogand] Purdue Univ, Construct Engn & Management, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Esmaeili, Behzad] George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; George Mason University,"Hasanzadeh, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Hasanzadeh, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Construct Engn & Management, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",lee2490@purdue.edu; sogandm@purdue.edu; besmaeil@gmu.edu,"Lee, Kyeongsuk/JED-6606-2023","Lee, Kyeongsuk/0009-0006-1885-3791; Hasanzadeh, Sogand/0000-0001-6214-3443; Esmaeili, Behzad/0000-0003-3858-1843",National Science Foundation; [1824238]; [2049711],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ;,"AcknowledgmentsThe National Science Foundation is thanked for supporting the research reported in this paper (1824238 and 2049711).

This imposes relevant constraints in the qualitative characterization of the motions of robots when sharing their workspace with humans. In this paper, we address the trade-off between two such constraints, namely the smoothness, which is related to the cognitive stress that a person undergoes when interacting with a robot, and the speed, which is related to normative safety requirements. Given an execution time, such an approach will allow us to plan safe trajectories without neglecting cognitive ergonomics and production efficiency aspects. We first present the methodology able to express the balance between these qualities in the form of a composite objective function. Thanks to the variational formalism, we identify the related set of optimal trajectories with respect to the given criterion and give a suitable parametrization to them. Then, we are able to formulate the safety requirements in terms of a reparametrization of the motion. Finally, numerical and experimental results are provided. This allows the identification of the preferable sets of the possible motions that satisfy the operator's psychological well-being and the assembly process performance by complying with the safety requirements in terms of mechanical risk prevention.","[Rojas, Rafael A.; Wehrle, Erich; Vidoni, Renato] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano I, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Vidoni, R (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano I, Fac Sci & Technol, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",rafael.rojas@unibz.it; Erich.Wehrle@unibz.it; renato.vidoni@unibz.it,"Wehrle, Erich/B-8622-2017","Wehrle, Erich/0000-0002-5760-4468; Rojas, Rafael A./0000-0002-3668-7719; VIDONI, Renato/0000-0002-7429-0974",,,,,33,16,16,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Depending on the industrial context, these systems bring physical and cognitive feelings that result in the acceptance of their users. Transparency qualifies the ability of a robot to follow the movements imposed by the operator without noting any resistant effort. The objective of this article is to develop a methodology that mixes the approach highlighting the human factors and their correlation to robotic criteria in the case of a passive manipulation arm with six degrees of freedom produced by the Neoditech company. An exploratory study was then conducted to measure criteria such as time, speed, and effort during manipulation along with criteria based on a technological level, personality and technology acceptance model-method questionnaires. From there, we uncovered a correlation between the user's personality, particularly their lack of neuroticism, and their means of evaluating the device through its usefulness, comfort, and indicators of mechanical behavior. This study is a preliminary analysis of user behaviors and traits that affect technological acceptance when dealing with a comanipulation arm. This work offers a framework for similar future analyses and recommends mechanical adjustments to the arm for increased user acceptance.","[Muller, Thomas; Joncheray, Denis; Billon, Alain] NEODITECH, F-44330 Mouzillon, France; [Muller, Thomas] Nantes Univ, Lab Digital Sci Nantes, F-44470 Carquefou, France; [Subrin, Kevin; Garnier, Sebastien] Nantes Univ, Ecole Cent Nantes, CNRS, LS2N,UMR 6004, F-44470 Nantes, France",Nantes Universite; Nantes Universite; Ecole Centrale de Nantes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Muller, T (corresponding author), NEODITECH, F-44330 Mouzillon, France.;Muller, T (corresponding author), Nantes Univ, Lab Digital Sci Nantes, F-44470 Carquefou, France.",thomas.muller@ls2n.fr; kevin.subrin@univ-nantes.fr; d.joncheray@neoditech.com; a.billon@neoditech.com; sebastien.garnier@univ-nantes.fr,,", Kevin/0000-0002-0587-8352",CIFRE PhD of Muller Thomas,CIFRE PhD of Muller Thomas,This work was supported by the CIFRE PhD of Muller Thomas (Industrial Convention for Training through Research).,,34,3,3,1,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2291,2168-2305,,IEEE T HUM-MACH SYST,IEEE T.

In the model, three foreman behaviors were considered, such as leading by example (LE), safety teaching (ST), and safety monitoring (SM). Five cognitive stages of a worker are also considered in the model, such as situation awareness, safety knowledge, subjective norm, safety attitude, and taking action. To obtain empirical data for the model parameters, a survey was conducted on a construction site in Seoul, South Korea, where the foreman-worker behavioral interactions and workers' unsafe behavior of taking shortcuts were observed. The model was established as Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) using AnyLogic software. Four scenarios of foremen's behavior were simulated using the model. The result shows that LE behavior has a positive, but weak significant influence on workers' safety behavior. ST was found to have a positive and the most significant influence on workers' safety behavior. Moreover, it should be provided with appropriate safety monitoring to maximize its effectiveness. The research findings promote stakeholders' understanding of the influence of foremen on workers' safety behavior and lead to the formation of informed policies and future research directions in the study field.","[Nwagbala, Daniel Chukwunonso; Park, Jong Yil] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Safety Engn, Seoul 018811, South Korea",Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Park, JY (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Safety Engn, Seoul 018811, South Korea.",jip111@seoultech.ac.kr,,"NWAGBALA, DANIEL CHUKWUNONSO/0000-0002-1263-5906",,,,,50,3,3,17,52,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JUL,2023,13,7,,,,,,,1792,10.3390/buildings13071792,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings13071792,,,18,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,N1YE5,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001035042500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to avoid significant discrepancy between human feedback cognitive mechanisms and traditional open-loop recognition methods, a novel intelligent cognitive model based on a variable granularity simulated feedback mechanism is explored in this paper, where evaluation indexes of cognitive results are established to freely regulate cognitive granularity, and the variable granularity simulated feedback mechanism is constructed to update cognitive features and cognitive rules with different granularities. The proposed cognitive model is applied to improve burning state recognition accuracy. With the initial granularity, a burning state recognition decision information system is developed using extracted flame image features. Random vector functional-linker (RVFL) network ensembles are employed to build the initial burning state recognition rules. By using cognitive errors and granularity transformation rules, a heuristic feedback mechanism is proposed to update the decision information system and recognition rules. The experimental results show that our method is effective and outperforms other open-loop recognition techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Forty subjects were recruited to cooperate and execute the cross-platform strike task in a virtual simulation platform. The physiological data and operation behavior data was collected during the experiment process. To realize the accurate classification of different cognitive performance states, a multi-source information fusion algorithm was developed based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and D-S evidence theory, which included the information collection module, the feature extraction module, and the information fusion module. The results indicated that there existed a significant correlation between the extractive feature indicators (i.e., EOG, ECG, and task performance indicators) and the cognitive performance.

BCI devices measure brain signals in EEG and allow users to interact with computerised systems, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), intuitively. However, the utilisation of EEG data in the IIoT for actuator control and the collection of such biometric data as evidence for policing the IIoT introduces considerable implications for the users' cognitive privacy. Thus, considering the importance of cognitive privacy in an evolving era of smart environments, it becomes imperative to develop methods that can ensure the cognitive privacy of users. Cognitive privacy also protects the anonymity of corporations and law enforcement. Furthermore, it maintains the inherent information found in EEG measurements, used by various machine and deep learning models. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based human cognitive privacy framework, named DeepCog, that ensures users' privacy through the application of feature transforming normalisation. A deep MLP model then processes the encoded data to classify samples according to an integer-based subject ID, enabling the framework to select the correct secondary deep MLP model (one for each subject) to identify eye activity.

Collaborative robots (cobots) can potentially reduce physical stress, but fully autonomous implementation has been particularly challenging due to skill, task variability, and robot limitations. CSC is an HRC method where the robot operates semi-autonomously while the human provides real-time corrections.Methods Twenty laboratory participants removed paint using an orbital sander, both manually and with a CSC robot. A fully automated robot was also tested.Results The CSC robot improved subjective discomfort compared to manual sanding in the upper arm by 29.5%, lower arm by 32%, hand by 36.5%, front of the shoulder by 24%, and back of the shoulder by 17.5%. Muscle fatigue measured using EMG, was observed in the medial deltoid and flexor carpi radialis for the manual condition. The composite cognitive workload on the NASA-TLX increased by 14.3% for manual sanding due to high physical demand and effort, while mental demand was 14% greater for the CSC robot. Digital imaging showed that the CSC robot outperformed the automated condition by 7.16% for uniformity, 4.96% for quantity, and 6.06% in total.Conclusions In this example, we found that human skills and techniques were integral to sanding and can be successfully incorporated into HRC systems. Humans performed the task using the CSC robot with less fatigue and discomfort.Applications The results can influence implementation of future HRC systems in manufacturing environments.","[Konstant, Anna] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Orr, Nitzan] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Masters Res, Madison, WI USA; [Hagenow, Michael; Gundrum, Isabelle] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Hu, Yu Hen] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Elect & Comp Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Mutlu, Bilge; Gleicher, Michael] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Comp Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Zinn, Michael] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Mech Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Radwin, Robert G.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Coll Engn, Madison, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Radwin, RG (corresponding author), Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 1550 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",rradwin@wisc.edu,"Radwin, Robert/IWM-0218-2023; Radwin, Robert/K-1340-2017","Gleicher, Michael/0000-0003-3295-4071; Radwin, Robert/0000-0002-7973-0641",NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI); Boeing Company [80NSSC19M0124],NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI); Boeing Company,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI) grant awarded to UW-Madison and The Boeing Company (Cooperative Agreement # 80NSSC19M0124).",,45,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Nevertheless, its impact on employees' behaviors and attitudes is still poorly known. As employees' engagement (EE) is a key element for a successful Lean Production (LP) implementation, there is the need to understand such AI's implications on EE in this scenario. This paper aims to investigate the impact of AI on EE in lean organisations. We performed a qualitative-empirical approach in which we first interviewed twelve academic experts to grasp the investigated problem. Then, we conducted a multi-case study in manufacturing organisations undergoing a LP implementation to refine such understanding based on the observation of real-world evidence. Identifying commonalities between these stages allowed the formulation of propositions for future theory testing and validation. Findings indicate that AI may positively impact EE dimensions (physical, cognitive, and emotional) in human-centred work environments, such as lean organisations, although not at the same extent. Results also suggest that employees' psychological conditions (safety, meaningfulness, and availability) are positively affected by the relationship between AI and EE. The demystification of AI's effect on EE helps practitioners anticipate potential issues that can impair the LP implementation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.","[Tortorella, Guilherme Luz] Univ Melbourne, Dept Mech Engn, Melbourne, Australia; [Tortorella, Guilherme Luz; Vassolo, Roberto] Univ Austral, IAE Business Sch, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Tortorella, Guilherme Luz] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Prod Engn, Nivaldo Dias,102-314, Florianopolis, Brazil; [Powell, Daryl] SINTEF Mfg, Raufoss, Norway; [Powell, Daryl] Univ South Eastern Norway, USN Sch Business, Kongsberg, Norway; [Hines, Peter] South East Technol Univ, Business Sch, Waterford, Ireland; [Mac Cawley Vergara, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Tlapa-Mendoza, Diego] Univ Autonoma Baja Calif, Dept Ind Engn, Ensenada, Mexico",University of Melbourne; Austral University; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); University College of Southeast Norway; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California,"Tortorella, GL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Prod Engn, Nivaldo Dias,102-314, Florianopolis, Brazil.",gtortorella@bol.com.br,"Mac Cawley, Alejandro/M-2128-2013","Mac Cawley, Alejandro/0000-0002-4848-4732",,,,,132,1,1,33,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Human-like system capabilities are not generally desirable there. But, recent trends in industrial robotics demand robust, flexible and efficient robots with a certain level of autonomy. Therefore, new and different approaches and perspectives in designing of industrial facilities are required. This paper reveals how a context-based reasoning can be used to achieve an intelligent robot group behavior. In order to achieve adaptivity, self-recovery or scalability of the system, a COgnitive MOdel for the Robot group control (COMOR) is developed. COMOR can be understood as an interpreter used to transform high-level context to low-level data, allowing machines to make context-based decisions. COMOR has three main parts and relies on a simulated Social Capital phenomenon as a feature of people. The first part is used to collect significant information from the environment. The second part is used to provide a set of possible solutions respecting the semantic domain description. The last part of COMOR is used to provide a behavioral component ensuring an optimal solution to given environmental conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present work, we advance in this area considering the visualization domain. We demonstrate an immediate application of our framework to help derive information on how visualizations for unit testing are currently addressing each cognitive support dimension. Our results demonstrate the lack of concern with adequate procedures for both planning and validation of the visualizations regarding cognitive support aspects.

We designed a medication timeline visualization intended to improve ease of use, speed, and accuracy in the ambulatory care of chronic disease. Materials and Methods We identified information needs for understanding a patient medication history, then applied human factors and interaction design principles to support that process. After research and analysis of existing medication lists and timelines to guide initial requirements, we hosted design workshops with multidisciplinary stakeholders to expand on our initial concepts. Subsequent core team meetings used an iterative user-centered design approach to refine our prototype. Finally, a small pilot evaluation of the design was conducted with practicing physicians. Results We propose an open-source online prototype that incorporates user feedback from initial design workshops, and broad multidisciplinary audience feedback. We describe the applicable design principles associated with each of the prototype's key features. A pilot evaluation of the design showed improved physician performance in 5 common medication-related tasks, compared to tabular presentation of the same information. Discussion There is industry interest in developing medication timelines based on the example prototype concepts. An open, standards-based technology platform could enable developers to create a medication timeline that could be deployable across any compatible health IT application. Conclusion The design goal was to improve physician understanding of a patient's complex medication history, using a medication timeline visualization. Such a design could reduce temporal and cognitive load on physicians for improved and safer care.","[Belden, Jeffery L.; Wegier, Pete; Koopman, Richelle J.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Family & Community Med, Columbia, MO USA; [Belden, Jeffery L.; Moore, Joi L.; Boren, Suzanne A.] Univ Missouri, MU Informat Inst, Columbia, MO USA; [Wegier, Pete] Sinai Hlth Syst, Temmy Latner Ctr Palliat Care, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wegier, Pete] Sinai Hlth Syst, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wegier, Pete] Univ Toronto, Dept Family & Community Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Patel, Jennifer] GoInvo, Boston, MA USA; [Hutson, Andrew] Univ Missouri, Sch Hlth Profess, Dept Hlth Sci, Columbia, MO USA; [Plaisant, Catherine] Univ Maryland, Inst Adv Comp Studies, Human Comp Interact Lab, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Moore, Joi L.; Lowrance, Nathan J.] Univ Missouri, Coll Educ, Sch Informat Sci & Learning Technol, Columbia, MO USA; [Boren, Suzanne A.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Management & Informat, Columbia, MO USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; University of Toronto; Sinai Health System Toronto; Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute; University of Toronto; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Belden, JL (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, M239 Med Sci, Columbia, MO 65212 USA.",beldenj@health.missouri.edu,"Wegier, Pete/P-4605-2017; Boren, Suzanne/M-6589-2014",,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [R01HS023328]; California HealthCare Foundation [17804]; Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under the Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) [10510592],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); California HealthCare Foundation; Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under the Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP),"This project was supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality grant number R01HS023328.

However, differences in types of lecturer gestures, such as rhythmic (beat) gestures and signaling (deictic) gestures, have not been investigated thoroughly yet concerning human lecturers in educational videos. In two experiments (N-1 = 108; N-2 = 121), participants received an educational video about weather phenomena (Experiment 1) or the industrial revolution (Experiment 2). Videos were manipulated in terms of the type of lecturer's gestures in the video (beat gestures vs. deictic gestures vs. no gestures). Learning outcomes, mental load and effort, parasocial interaction, social presence, affective rating, and agent-persona perception (Experiment 2) were measured. Results indicated a significant effect of gestures on retention performance in both experiments. In line with the signaling principle, deictic gestures enhanced learning outcomes. In contrast, beat gestures did not foster learning in comparison with a video without gestures. These results are interpreted considering lower mental load, higher social presence, and parasocial interaction in the signaling condition. In particular, attention towards the lecturer was significantly enhanced in the condition with deictic gestures in both experiments.","[Beege, Maik; Schneider, Sascha; Nebel, Steve; Schlemmel, Julia; Weidenmueller, Jasmin; Rey, Guenter Daniel] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Fac Humanities, Psychol Learning Digital Media, Str Nationen 12, D-09111 Chemnitz, Germany; [Ninaus, Manuel; Moeller, Korbinian] Leibniz Inst Wissensmedien, Tubingen, Germany; [Ninaus, Manuel; Moeller, Korbinian] Univ Tubingen, LEAD Grad Sch & Res Network, Tubingen, Germany; [Moeller, Korbinian] Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychol, Tubingen, Germany; [Moeller, Korbinian] Loughborough Univ, Ctr Math Cognit, Sch Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England",Technische Universitat Chemnitz; Leibniz Institut fur Wissensmedien; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Loughborough University,"Beege, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, Fac Humanities, Psychol Learning Digital Media, Str Nationen 12, D-09111 Chemnitz, Germany.",maik.beege@phil.tu-chemnitz.de,"Schneider, Sascha/GWU-6453-2022; Ninaus, Manuel/AAC-6951-2020; Moeller, Korbinian/JYQ-5365-2024; Rey, Guenter/C-1390-2012","Rey, Gunter Daniel/0000-0001-9717-8478; Ninaus, Manuel/0000-0002-4664-8430; Schneider, Sascha/0000-0003-4690-3777; Gui, Yang/0000-0001-8856-4617",,,,,65,29,30,7,93,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1315,1873-782X,,COMPUT EDUC,Comput.

Thus, the detrimental effects of continuous monitoring tasks, which are well established across transportation industry domains, could be alleviated.","[Brandenburger, Niels; Naumann, Anja] German Aerosp Ctr, Human Factors Dept, Inst Transportat Syst, Lilienthalpl 7, D-38108 Braunschweig, Germany; [Brandenburger, Niels; Naumann, Anja] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Transportat Syst, Human Factors Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Hoermann, Hans-Juergen; Stelling, Dirk] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Aerosp Med, Dept Aviat & Space Psychol, Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Brandenburger, N (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr, Human Factors Dept, Inst Transportat Syst, Lilienthalpl 7, D-38108 Braunschweig, Germany.",niels.brandenburger@dlr.de,"Hoermann, Hans-Juergen/AAG-1355-2021","Stelling, Dirk/0000-0003-3346-6141; Hoermann, Hans-Juergen/0000-0002-6358-7027",Helmholtz Association,Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The studies were part of the project Next Generation Train 3 (NGT3) at the German Aerospace Center and supported by the Helmholtz Association.",,37,12,12,2,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0954-4097,2041-3017,,P I MECH ENG F-J RAI,Proc.

Cognitive computing is represented as a next-generation application AI-based solutions which provide human-machine interaction with personalized interactions and services that imitate human behavior. On the other hand, a large volume of data is generated from smart city applications such as healthcare, smart transportation, retail industry, and firefighting. There is always a concern on how to efficiently manage the large volume of generated data. Recently many existing researches discussed the analysis of the large quantity of data using cognitive computing; however, these researches are failed to handle the certain problems, namely scalability, and flexibility of data gathered in a smart city environment. Data captured from millions of sensors can be cross implemented across various cognitive computing applications to ensure real-time responses. In this paper, we study the cognitive internet of things (CIoT) and propose a CIoT-based smart city network (CIoT-Net) architecture which describes how data gathered from smart city applications can be analyzed using cognitive computing and handle the scalability and flexibility problems. We discuss various technologies such as AI and big data analysis to implement the proposed architecture. Finally, we describe the possible research challenges and opportunities while implementing the proposed architecture.","[Park, Jin-ho; Salim, Mikail Mohammed; Jo, Jeong Hoon; Sicato, Jose Costa Sapalo; Rathore, Shailendra; Park, Jong Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol SeoulTech, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 01811, South Korea",Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Park, JH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol SeoulTech, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",jhpark1@seoultech.ac.kr,"rathore, shailendra/I-9320-2019; Salim, Mikail Mohammed/ABC-4613-2021","Jo, Jeong Hoon/0000-0002-9073-4993",Seoul National University of Science and Technology,Seoul National University of Science and Technology,"This study was supported by the Research Program, which was funded by the Seoul National University of Science and Technology.",,54,82,84,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2192-1962,,HUM-CENT COMPUT INFO,Human-centric Comput.

We used a qualitative explorative approach, with semistructured interviews with 31 informants from 10 companies. Thematic analysis revealed the categories 'technology focus', 'understanding of end-user involvement versus end users' actual involvement', 'lack of access to end users', 'lack of human factors methods in early phases', and 'lack of official rules and regulations'. Findings show that during the earlier phases of designing algorithms and training data, end users are hardly involved.

This paper examines the relationship between physical fatigue and quality, and then proposes a mathematical model to optimize work and break time based on the relationship. An experiment was conducted by asking a group of participants to perform a cognitive task at four levels of physical fatigue, measured by heart rate. Elevated heart rates were gained by riding a static bicycle. Experiment data showed a linear relationship between quality and physical fatigue. Then, we developed a mathematical model to optimize work and break schedule for operator, where the decision variable was the number of parts in the first run, and the objective function was the average total process time. The model worked properly and was effective to solve the optimization of work and break times. The model in this paper can be used by managers to optimize work and break times for operators. With data on operator fatigue and recovery rates, fatigue-to-quality constant and gradient, we developed a model for managers to determine work and break times to obtain optimal process and break times.","[Kurniawan, Dwi; Febrianti, Asterina] Inst Teknol Nas Bandung, Ind Engn Master Program, Bandung, Indonesia",,"Kurniawan, D (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Nas Bandung, Ind Engn Master Program, Bandung, Indonesia.",dwi_kurniawan@itenas.ac.id,"Kurniawan, Dwi/LNP-4077-2024",,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,KOREAN INST INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERS,SEOUL,"VICTORIA BLDG RM 509, 705-1 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-080, SOUTH KOREA",1598-7248,2234-6473,,IND ENG MANAG SYST,Ind.

Then, specific attention is dedicated to discuss the implications for improving robustness of system design and tackling the surrounding factors and tendencies that could lead to the manifestation of human errors.","[Moura, R.; Beer, M.; Patelli, E.; Lewis, J.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Knoll, F.] NCK Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Liverpool,"Moura, R (corresponding author), Natl Agcy Petr Nat Gas & Biofuels ANP, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",,"Beer, Michael/G-2050-2015; Patelli, Edoardo/B-1364-2010","Patelli, Edoardo/0000-0002-5007-7247; Beer, Michael/0000-0002-0611-0345",,,,,14,3,4,0,3,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,BOCA RATON,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",,,978-1-315-73697-6; 978-1-138-02681-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,1037,1046,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Transportation Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Transportation,BF3HL,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000380543400138,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spatial design is frequently represented in two-dimensional (2D) drawings of various views. These views must be combined and decoded by the end user to effectively understand all orientations of a building element and can lead to errors. Advances in three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) and 3D printing have provided promising advancements in the presentation of spatial engineering information. This research investigates cognitive-workload demands of each information format. Cognitive workload is the amount of mental resources required to complete a task from the total available mental resources. Asking subjects to complete a reconstructing task of a simple structure using 2D drawings, a 3D CAD interface, and a 3D printed model introduces the individuals to alternative forms of information presentation. After completing the task, the subjects were surveyed on their perceptions of mental workload in six main factors using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). Through a statistical analysis, there was no difference in mental workload between the three types of information presentation, indicating that the cognitive demands of the mediums are similar. However, there were statistically significant differences in workload factors due to demographic influences, such as occupation and CAD experience levels. In addition, mental workload affected the subject's productivity in task completion. The primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the investigation of mental workload as a factor in spatial understanding, and more specifically, identifying cognitive demands of individuals when presented with spatial engineering information in various formats.","[Dadi, Gabriel B.; Taylor, Timothy R.

For solving this problem, a data processing methodology based on cognitive computing and cognitive informatics is presented. By simulating the human brain information processing to eye, ears, hands, nose, tongue and other sensory organs, the data of job-shop floor IOT is divided into seven layers from bottom to top, and those layers is classified to passive data acquisition layer and active data acquisition layer. Active data acquisition process consists of three phases. The manufacturing data, manufacturing information and manufacturing knowledge are respectively acquired in three phases, and stored in the corresponding type of database in order to realize the fast reading and updating in different ways. Manufacturing information and manufacturing knowledge based on different granularity are also divided into different levels to meet the job-shop floor IOT management requirements for quick and correct decision-making. This methodology not only effectively reduces the scale of job-shop floor IOT management data, but also gives out different judgments for manufacture problems according to different response time requirements.

The interactions among them can be quite demanding in terms of cognitive resources. Existing systems do not yet consider the psychological aspects of safety in the domain. This lack can lead to hazardous situations, thus compromising the performance of the working system. This work proposes a connective decision-making framework for a flexible CPS, which can quickly respond to dynamic changes and be resilient to emergent hazards. First, Anxiety is defined and categorized for expected/unforeseen situations that a CPS could encounter through historical data using the Ishikawa method. Second, visual cues are used to gather the CPS's current state (such as human pose and object identification). Third, a mathematical model is developed using Mixed-integer programming (MIP) to allocate optimal resources, to tackle high-impact situations generating Anxiety. Finally, the logic is designed for an effective counter-mechanism to mitigate Anxiety. The proposed method was tested on a realistic industrial scenario incorporating a collaborative CPS. The results demonstrated that the proposed method improves the decision-making of a CPS facing a complex scenario, ensures physical safety, and effectively enhances the human-machine team's productivity.","[Bin Islam, Syed Osama; Lughmani, Waqas Akbar] Capital Univ Sci & Technol CUST, Dept Mech Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Qureshi, Waqar S.] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Khalid, Azfar] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Digital Innovat Res Grp, Nottingham, England",Capital University of Science & Technology; Nottingham Trent University,"Bin Islam, SO (corresponding author), Capital Univ Sci & Technol CUST, Dept Mech Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan.",osama_bin@yahoo.com,"Bin Islam, Syed Osama/JLK-9297-2023; Qureshi, Waqar/ABG-1744-2020; Lughmani, Waqas/JHU-5721-2023","Khalid, Azfar/0000-0001-5270-6599; Lughmani, Waqas/0000-0003-2989-1559; Bin Islam, Syed Osama/0000-0002-1593-8152",,,,,36,3,3,3,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

The Human Factors areas examined in this article are organizational, cognitive and physical ergonomics. A key question to be explored is as follows: To what degree are the petroleum industry and safety authorities in Norway focusing on these Human Factors areas from the design phase? To investigate this, we conducted an innovative exploratory study of the development of four control centres in Norwegian oil and gas industry in collaboration between users, management and Human Factors experts. We also performed a literature survey and discussion with the professional Human Factors network in Norway. We investigated the Human Factors focus, reasons for not considering Human Factors and consequences of missing Human Factors in safety management. The results revealed an immature focus and organization of Human Factors. Expertise on organizational ergonomics and cognitive ergonomics are missing from companies and safety authorities and are poorly prioritized during the development. The easy observable part of Human Factors (i.e. physical ergonomics) is often in focus. Poor focus on Human Factors in the design process creates demanding conditions for human operators and impact safety and resilience. There is lack of non-technical skills such as communication and decision-making. New technical equipment such as Closed Circuit Television is implemented without appropriate use of Human Factors standards. Human Factors expertise should be involved as early as possible in the responsible organizations. Verification and validation of Human Factors should be improved and performed from the start, by certified Human Factors experts in collaboration with the workforce. The authorities should check-back that the regulatory framework of Human Factors is communicated, understood and followed.","[Johnsen, Stig O.; Fossum, Knut Robert] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Sem Saelandsvei 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Johnsen, Stig O.; Kilskar, Stine Skaufel] SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF,"Johnsen, SO (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Sem Saelandsvei 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",stig.o.johnsen@sintef.no,"; Fossum, Knut Robert/P-1508-2018","Kilskar, Stine Skaufel/0000-0002-3209-4852; Fossum, Knut Robert/0000-0002-1020-730X",,,,,33,13,17,6,83,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1748-006X,1748-0078,,P I MECH ENG O-J RIS,Proc.

Recently, researchers have conducted empirical studies to identify the most-severe cognitive difficulties of modellers when using UML model editors. Their analyses show that users' prominent challenges are in remembering the contextual information when performing a particular modelling task; and locating, understanding, and fixing errors in the models. To alleviate these difficulties, we propose two Focus+Context user interfaces that provide enhanced cognitive support and automation in the user's interaction with a model editor. Moreover, we conducted two empirical studies to assess the effectiveness of our interfaces on human users. Our results reveal that our interfaces help users 1) improve their ability to successfully fulfil their tasks, 2) avoid unnecessary switches among diagrams, 3) produce more error-free models, 4) remember contextual information, and 5) reduce time on tasks.","[Pourali, Parsa] Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Atlee, Joanne M.] Univ Waterloo, David Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Pourali, P (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",ppourali@uwaterloo.ca; jmatlee@uwaterloo.ca,"Atlee, Joanne/KCY-7928-2024",,,,,,50,3,3,0,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-7281-2535-0,,,,2019,,,,,,,183,193,,10.1109/MODELS.2019.000-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MODELS.2019.000-3,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BP1BJ,,Green Published,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000538727000018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposal is to combine social software robots (softbots) with industrial collaborative robots (co-bots) to create a digital apprentice for experienced operators in human robot collaboration workstations. This is to address the problem within industry that experienced operators have difficulties in explaining how they perform their tasks and later, how to turn this procedural knowledge (knowhow) into instructions to be shared among other operators. By using social softbots and co-bots, as cooperative agents with embodied automation features, we think we can facilitate the 'externalization' of procedural knowledge in human-robot interaction(s). This enabled by the capabilities of social cooperative agents with embodied automation features of continuously learning by looking over the shoulder of the operators, and documenting and collaborating with them in a non-intrusive way as they perform their daily tasks.","[Fast-Berglund, Asa] Chalmers Univ Technol, Prod Syst, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Thorvald, Peter] Univ Skovde, Prod Dev, Skovde, Sweden; [Billing, Erik] Univ Skovde, Informat Technol, Skovde, Sweden; [Palmquist, Adam] Insert Coin, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Romero, David] Tecnol Monterrey, Ctr Innovat Design & Technol, Monterrey, Mexico; [Weichhart, Georg] Flexible Prod Syst, Studgart, Austria",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Skovde; University of Skovde; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Fast-Berglund, Å (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Prod Syst, Gothenburg, Sweden.",asa.fasth@chalmers.se; peter.thorvald@his.se; erik.billing@his.se; adam@insertcoin.se; david.romero.diaz@gmail.com; Georg.Weichhart@profactor.at,"Billing, Erik/AAC-5790-2019; Romero, David/GQA-9701-2022; Weichhart, Georg/HZM-2867-2023; Thorvald, Peter/C-3143-2012; Palmquist, Adam/GLS-5466-2022","Weichhart, Georg/0000-0002-1405-5825; Billing, Erik/0000-0002-6568-9342; Thorvald, Peter/0000-0002-8369-5471; Palmquist, Adam/0000-0003-0943-6022","Stena Industry Innovation Lab (SIILab); Production 2030, Vinnova; Stenastiftelsen Swedish research programs; Pro2Future Lab; Austrian COMET program Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies - under Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Province of Upper Austria; Province of Styria; Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG [854184]","Stena Industry Innovation Lab (SIILab); Production 2030, Vinnova; Stenastiftelsen Swedish research programs; Pro2Future Lab; Austrian COMET program Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies - under Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Province of Upper Austria; Province of Styria; Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG","This research work is partly funded by the Stena Industry Innovation Lab (SIILab), co-funded within the Production 2030, Vinnova and Stenastiftelsen Swedish research programs, and by the Pro2Future Lab, co-funded within the Austrian COMET program Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies - under the auspices of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs and of the Provinces of Upper Austria and Styria.

Moreover, machine-to-machine communications will further expand the demand to even higher levels. In addition, Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) created-data will contribute to increasing such demand by 100 and possibly 1000 folds. This increase in demand can be supported by densification and expansion of wireless networks. Such expansion poses new challenge on energy efficiency. This paper presents several techniques to enable energy savings for both devices and infrastructure. These techniques are based on cognitive and cooperative concepts to enable low power network acquisition, energy efficient paging, and dynamic/opportunistic network energy savings. A simulation analysis based on the information from a commercially deployed network presents a promising results on the possible infrastructure energy saving gains as well as a seamless location service offering.","[Soliman, Samir S.] Qualcomm Technol Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Song, Bongyong] Qualcomm Inc, 5775 Morehouse Dr, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Soliman, Samir S.] ALL WIRELESS CONSULTANCY, Poway, CA 92064 USA",Qualcomm; Qualcomm,"Song, BY (corresponding author), Qualcomm Inc, 5775 Morehouse Dr, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",sssoliman@hotmail.com; bsong@qualcomm.com,,,,,,,34,23,24,0,21,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",1084-8045,1095-8592,,J NETW COMPUT APPL,J.

The European Project SUaaVE (SUpporting acceptance of automated Vehicle) acknowledges that human-centric design is necessary to help AV in becoming accepted and trusted by road users (drivers, passengers, pedestrians) when it is introduced into the market. In the first phase of the project, partners, collaborating on the HMI design, performed different tests. C.R.F. S.C.p.A. performed a user test, which had different objectives. In this paper, the objective of the usability evaluation of the SUaaVE first cognitive HMI prototype is described. The test was performed by showing users a video of automated driving in an AV using the first iteration of the HMI. The findings were then used during the subsequent redesign phase to improve upon the HMI, according to the Human-Centred Design process. This study allowed identifying advantages and limits of the methodology and of the HMI prototype and to identify and share redesign suggestions (for the following phase of the project) with partners.","[Toffetti, Antonella; Balocco, Elena; Borgarello, Laura; Turi, Giovanni; Bertolino, Daniela] CRF SCpA, Str Torino 50, I-10043 Orbassano, Italy; [Chateau, Benjamin] CATIE, 1 Ave Dr Albert Schweitzer, F-33400 Talence, France",,"Toffetti, A (corresponding author), CRF SCpA, Str Torino 50, I-10043 Orbassano, Italy.",,"Toffetti, Antonella/IQW-7253-2023",,European Union [814999]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [814999] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"The paper presents the first user testing loop of the first version of the cognitive HMI prototype of the project SUaaVE (SUpporting acceptance of automated VEhicle), funded from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No 814999.",,10,0,0,2,16,SCITEPRESS,SETUBAL,"AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-758-538-8,,,,2021,,,,,,,240,248,,10.5220/0010725900003060,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010725900003060,,,9,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT1CQ,,hybrid,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000796479400025,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in the real world, the following conditions may make it difficult to precisely model knowledge based on current FPNs, including the cognitive nonconformity, fuzziness and uncertainty of experiential cognition of experts. In an effort to overcome the shortcomings of current FPNs, the interval-valued intuitionistic FPNs (IVIFPNs) are proposed based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs), IVIFSs hybrid averaging (IVIFSsHA) operator and extended TOPSIS (ETOPSIS). Combining with IVIFSsHA operator, an inference algorithm based on matrix operation is proposed to improve the efficiency of computing final truth values. In addition, an optimal alternative is determined based on the proposed ETOPSIS, in which intuitionistic information and fuzzy information can be considered simultaneously based on the proposed information collaborative entropy. Finally, a comparison test is presented to show the effectiveness of ETOPSIS. Moreover, a novel model for the identification of aluminum electrolysis cell condition is proposed based on IVIFPNs and ETOPSIS, and the application result shows that the proposed methods are efficient to deal with cognitive nonconformity and manage fuzziness and uncertainty of expert knowledge.

Due to their flexibility and inherent interpretability, FCMs have been used in various modelling and prediction tasks to support human decisions. However, a notable limitation of FCMs is their susceptibility to inadvertently capturing spurious correlations from data, undermining their prediction accuracy and interpretability. In addressing this challenge, our primary contribution is the introduction of a novel framework for constructing FCMs using the Liang-Kleeman Information Flow (L-K IF) analysis, a quantitative causality analysis rigorously derived from first principles. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the identification of actual causal relationships from the data using an automatic causal search algorithm. These relationships are subsequently imposed as constraints in the FCM learning procedure to rule out spurious correlations and improve the aggregate predictive and explanatory power of the model. Numerical simulations validate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art FCM-based models, thereby bolstering the reliability, accuracy, and interpretability of FCMs.","[Tyrovolas, Marios; Stylios, Chrysostomos] Univ Ioannina, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Arta 47150, Greece; [Stylios, Chrysostomos] Athena Res Ctr, Ind Syst Inst, Patras Sci Pk Bldg, Patras 26504, Greece; [Liang, X.

The human-machine interaction is typically one of the slowest elements in this chain, and therefore on the critical efficiency path. An efficiency increase of the human-machine interaction can lead to an efficiency increase of the entire digital value chain. To determine the efficiency of a UX design concept, an efficiency benchmark is needed before a UX design concept is created. The paper introduces GAIS (Goal - Assumption - Interaction Steps), a cognitive task analysis method. The author developed the GAIS method for use in industrial projects and validated it in industrial projects. GAIS allows to determine an interaction efficiency benchmark for a given use case. The benchmark is measured in number of interaction steps per use case. An important step in the GAIS method is a systematic reduction of interaction steps by considering manual, semi-automated and automated interaction. An interaction designer can use the determined efficiency benchmark to make an interaction design concept more efficient. The paper describes how GAIS is applied, with several examples (GUI and VUI), and how it guides the interaction design process.","[Degen, Helmut] Siemens Corp, Corp Technol, 755 Coll Rd E, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Siemens AG; Siemens AG,"Degen, H (corresponding author), Siemens Corp, Corp Technol, 755 Coll Rd E, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",helmut.degen@siemens.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2945-9133,1611-3349,978-3-030-22506-3; 978-3-030-22507-0,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2019,11571,,,,,,3,19,,10.1007/978-3-030-22507-0_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-22507-0_1,,,17,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Ergonomics; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Engineering; Psychology,BX3ZH,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001286443100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Operators are still required to supervise the (system) supervisor and intervene when variables exceed pre-programmed parameters to avert major incidents. Research in human-computer interaction and advanced process control has often focused on data-driven methods for fault detection as distinct from operator effectiveness. In this paper, we explore the application of a novel data-driven fault-detection technique to enhance operator decision support. During a simulated abnormal event, three users attempted to diagnose the root cause of a process upset using a traditional or standard interface, then with the addition of causal maps, in a A-B-A single-subject design. The causal maps were derived using a hierarchical method that could be applied to a wide range of chemical processes as an online, adaptive augmentation for abnormal situation management. Using a think-aloud technique, the three participants developed high quality insights into the process without negatively impacting the overall task load. These preliminary findings challenge prevailing wisdom in process control interface design, which often focuses on de-cluttering displays at the cost of information resolution.","[Naef, Michelle; Lefsrud, Lianne] Univ Alberta, Chem & Mat Engn, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Chadha, Karan] Univ Alberta, Comp Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Naef, M (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Chem & Mat Engn, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.",naef@ualberta.ca; chadha1@ualberta.ca; lefsrud@ualberta.ca,"Lefsrud, Lianne/KUP-8682-2024",,"NSERC [RGPIN-2018-05170-Lefsrud, COVID-2020-06431 Lefsrud]",NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research is funded by NSERC RGPIN-2018-05170-Lefsrud and NSERC COVID-2020-06431 Lefsrud Developing a Safety Management Systems (SMS) Model.,,36,6,7,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-4230,1873-3352,,J LOSS PREVENT PROC,J.

CWP specify the cognitive problem that integrated designs must solve. They are technology-neutral, abstract work objects, allowing people and computing to share and transform them in coordination. The end-to-end method is illustrated on a system that employs AI for remote patient monitoring (RPM) during COVID-19 home care. The CWP specified actionable risk awareness as the medical problem RPM must solve. Graphical modeling standards enabled user participation: CWP as finite state machines and system behavior in BPMN. For model checking, the CWPs logical content was translated to linear temporal logic (LTL) and the BPMN into Promela as inputs to the SPIN model checker. SPIN verified the Promela implements the LTL correctly. We conclude this CWP-derived RPM design solves the medical problem and enhances patient safety.

Automated playtesting based on player simulation is expected to reduce playtesting costs. Still, it has not yet been widely applied due to the lack of a method that realistically simulates players' gameplays with different skills. Based on a cognitive model of sensorimotor coordination that explains the human button input process, we propose a novel automated playtesting technique that predicts the game difficulty experienced by players with different skills in moving-target acquisition (MTA) games. The model has free parameters representing the inherent skills of players. Once the parameters are obtained for a specific population (e.g., seniors), it is possible to estimate the game difficulty at the population level in multiple games. We applied the technique to two simple MTA games and showed that it could predict the relative difference in game difficulties experienced by players with different skills.","[Lee, Injung; Kim, Hyunchul] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Byungjoo] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Yonsei University,"Lee, B (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",edndn@kaist.ac.kr; hynchl@kaist.ac.kr; byungjoo.lee@yonsei.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea [2020R1A2C4002146]; Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation [2020-0-01361]; Korea Creative ContentAgency [R2019020010],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Korea Creative ContentAgency(Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA)),"This research was funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (2020R1A2C4002146), Korea Creative ContentAgency (R2019020010), and Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (2020-0-01361).",,61,6,6,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-8651-7,,,,2021,,,,,,,4920,4929,,10.1145/3474085.3475429,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3474085.3475429,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW4GR,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001147786904118,View Full Record in Web of Science

Human memory capacity and robot cognitive and understanding capabilities are limited when faced with different dismantling tasks for end-of-life power batteries. Insufficient human-computer interaction capabilities greatly hinder the efficiency of human-robot collaboration (HRC) operations. The existing HRC relies heavily on the experience of operators, while the existing disassembly system fails to update new disassembly strategies in real time when facing new battery varieties. Therefore, this paper proposes an augmented reality-assisted human-robot collaboration (AR-HRC) power battery dismantling system based on transfer learning. It consists of three modules: AR-HRC knowledge modeling, dismantling subgraph similarity assessment, and strategy transfer update. The AR-HRC knowledge modeling module aims to establish an intelligent mapping from tasks to collaborative strategies based on part features. Based on the evaluation of task similarity, the mobility assessment model divides subtasks into similar and dissimilar classes. For similar subtasks, the original dismantling strategy can be applied to the current task. However, for different subtasks, operators can issue instructions to the AR-HRC system through the human-computer interaction function of AR and develop new collaborative strategies based on actual conditions. Finally, a case study of power battery dismantling is conducted, and the results show that compared to traditional pre-programmed assembly, this system can improve dismantling efficiency and reduce cognitive burden.","[Li, Jie; Duan, Liangliang; Qu, Weibin; Zheng, Hangbin] Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Donghua University,"Duan, LL (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",qingxixiliu@163.com,"DUAN, LIANGLIANG/KDP-0402-2024",,Municipal Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [21ZR1400800]; Priming Scientific Research Foundation for the Junior Researchers of Donghua University; Graduate Student Innovation Fund of Donghua University [CUSF-DH-D-2022072],Municipal Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; Priming Scientific Research Foundation for the Junior Researchers of Donghua University; Graduate Student Innovation Fund of Donghua University,"This work is financially supported by the Municipal Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (21ZR1400800), in part by the Priming Scientific Research Foundation for the Junior Researchers of Donghua University and the Graduate Student Innovation Fund of Donghua University (CUSF-DH-D-2022072)",,30,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0890-0604,1469-1760,,AI EDAM,AI EDAM-Artif.

As a consequence, human operators are frequently confronted with newly assembled systems that differ from previous ones in some ways while not differing in others. This partial overlap creates a number of challenges with regard to operator performance and learning. Both differentiation and generalization of knowledge are needed, which leads to a goal conflict: on the one hand, operators have to know the specifics of the current system, update their understanding of functional relations between system parameters, and use operation procedures that are tailored to the requirements of the current situation. On the other hand, they need to apply the knowledge they have acquired in previous plant setups to solve problems in a new one. While unwanted carryover must be avoided, appropriate transfer is essential. The present article provides an overview of the challenges and potentials of learning and transfer in changing environments as discussed in the cognitive science and situated cognition literatures. This overview is of prescriptive nature: it presents results and theories that should be considered when analyzing operator performance and designing interfaces or training in modular plants. To this end, the article considers how learning is adapted to the volatility of the environment, how mental representations are updated, how conceptual and procedural knowledge is transferred to new situations, and how learning is shaped by interactions with the environment.","[Mueller, Romy] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Engn Psychol & Appl Cognit Res, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Müller, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Engn Psychol & Appl Cognit Res, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",romy.mueller@tu-dresden.de,,"Muller, Romy/0000-0003-4750-7952",German Research Foundation [PA 1232/6-1],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Parts of this work were supported by a grant of the German Research Foundation (PA 1232/6-1).

Therefore, it is necessary to improve the security of electric power system and the decision capacity in the emergency process. As a complicated system, electric power system is affected by many factors, the reasoning of which can be regarded as a process that combines intuition and cognition. Uncertainty characterizes human cognitive and reasoning processes. Several extensions of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) model have been suggested to handle multifarious sources of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the uncertainty from human doubt may arise in the assignment of membership degrees, which is neglected in current FCMs. To deal with this problem, a novel approach based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) and FCMs, called hesitant fuzzy cognitive maps (HFCMs), is presented in this paper. The proposed method, which possesses the features of tackling hesitancy explicitly during the experts' assessments, is demonstrated by an example on the analysis of risk factors affecting electric power system. It can provide a better simulation of the inherent uncertainty in real problems through the hesitancy represented in experts' knowledge, and a what-if analysis for describing hesitant fuzzy scenario is well developed with the HFCM model.

However, further investigations have revealed that humans are not the primary cause of these accidents, but have inherited the problems and difficulties of working with complex systems created by engineers. The operators have to comprehend malfunctions in real time, respond quickly, and make rapid decisions to return operational units to normal conditions, but under these circumstances, the mental workload of operators rises sharply, and a mental workload that is too high increases the rate of error. Therefore, cognivitive human features such as situation awareness (SA)-one of the most important prerequisite for decision-making-should be considered and analyzed appropriately. This paper applys the SA Error Taxonomy methodology to analyze the role of SA in three different accidents: (1) A runaway chemical reaction at Institute, West Virginia killing two employees, injuring eight people, and requiring the evacuation of more than 40,000 residents adjacent to the facility, (2) The ignition of a vapor cloud at Bellwood, Illinois that killed one person, injured two employees, and caused significant business interruption, and (3) An explosion at Ontario, California injuring four workers and caused extensive damage to the facility. In addition, the paper presents certain requirements for cognitive operator support system development and operator training under abnormal situations to promote operators' SA in the process industry.

When programmed to perform required movements via a process called teaching, they can accomplish a wide variety of complex tasks. In conventional teaching processes, a teaching pendant (TP), which is a tethered controller with which the operator inputs specific movement commands, is used. However, such devices normally have so many buttons that operators often experience difficulty in programming operations intuitively, so the teaching process consumes significant amounts of time and effort. To solve this problem, intuitive operation methods in which human body motions (such as hand gestures) are used as input to the robot have been studied. However, no quantitative comparisons between those new gesture-based and conventional teaching methods have yet been made. With that point in mind, the present paper proposes a virtual space-based evaluation system in which operators control the position and orientation of a six-degree-of-freedom virtual robot hand in order to evaluate and compare TP- and gesture-based operation methods. The experimental results show that when compared to TP-based methods, gesture-based operation methods achieved higher evaluations in terms of time and psychological aspects. In addition, four types of gesture-based operating methods were proposed in order to consider different ways in which position changes and orientation changes could be handled. The operability levels of the four gesture types were also compared quantitatively using the proposed evaluation system, and the obtained experimental results suggest that such differences can affect the cognitive burden imposed on the operator.","[Komori, Masaharu; Terakawa, Tatsuro; Yasuda, Ikko] Kyoto Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Sci, Kyoto 6158540, Japan",Kyoto University,"Terakawa, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Sci, Kyoto 6158540, Japan.",terakawa@me.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Komori, Masaharu/JPX-3148-2023","Komori, Masaharu/0000-0001-8696-8167; Terakawa, Tatsuro/0000-0002-9418-3156",,,,,28,3,3,0,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,24966,24978,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970761,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970761,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LB5EB,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000524656700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this article is to understand the cognitive processes of the construction engineer that allow them to anticipate problems in several Levels of Anticipation of the construction process, planning, and decision making in production and safety. To achieve this goal we use, interacting with the ethnographic study, the methodology of activity analysis and, in particular, what is called approach of the course of action. Thus, the cases presented make it possible to understand how the construction engineer, using information available in the Levels of Anticipation of the construction process, manipulates resources-personal (tacit and explicit knowledge, skills, etc.), material (designs), and social (relationship with his team)-when he perceives problems. By understanding their fortes, we can better foment their cognitive process. Thus, the theory is relevant and contributes to describe and explain the processes of human problem solving, decision making, and planning.","[Fonseca, Eduardo Diniz] FUNDACTR MTE, Rua Guajajaras 40,13 & 14 Andar, BR-30180100 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Lima, Francisco P.

The workshop gathered an interdisciplinary cohort of researchers from philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to discuss the future of 4E (embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended) cognition research in and outside of Japan. The aim was to identify the most prominent fields in which 4E research is taking place, such as 4E in relation to artificial life, human-computer interfaces, and phenomenology. We strived to articulate the most important open questions in these fields, and understand how adopting a 4E perspective may yield unique ways of answering them, as well as novel avenues of long-term interdisciplinary collaboration. We then discussed how the 4E framework may embed itself as a point of connection between the social and biological sciences, and bridge the gap between academia, medicine, and policymaking, to inform how humans conduct research, think about ourselves, and live life. In this report, we summarize the topics of discussion, the insights garnered, and the practical methods used to ignite discussions and collaborations amongst the researchers in attendance, as a model for future workshops with similar aims.","[Tavassoli, Samira] NYU, 400 Broome St, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Montoya, Morgan] Technol Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci, Onna, Japan; [Ishihara, Ken] Hokkaido Univ, Ctr Human Nat Artificial Intelligence & Neurosci, Sapporo, Japan",New York University; Hokkaido University,"Tavassoli, S (corresponding author), NYU, 400 Broome St, New York, NY 10013 USA.",sst426@nyu.edu,,"Montoya, Morgan/0000-0003-0312-7624; Tavassoli, Samira/0000-0002-0654-2906",,,,,17,0,0,5,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1059-7123,1741-2633,,ADAPT BEHAV,Adapt.

The impact of the human factor on the efficacy and efficiency of production systems is difficult to predict, since it often escapes the predictions of orthodox models of rationality. Recent behavioural studies in Operations Management highlight that the Human's behaviour deviates from the optimal solution, even in simplified operating conditions such as those represented by the famous Newsvendor problem. Building on the results of controlled human experiments, this study proposes a decision-making model that accounts for the heuristics of anchoring and adjustment. Two experimental conditions, differing in the provision of demand information to decision makers, are used to generate data. The model estimated shows that anchoring and adjustment behaviour differs in the two conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, instituting stringent safety standards and management procedures are considered insufficient to address workplace safety risks. Most accident cases attribute to unsafe actions and human behaviors on the job, which raises serious concerns for safety professionals from physical to psychological particularly when the world is facing a life-threatening Pandemic situation, i.e., COVID-19. It is imperative to re-examine the safety management of facilities and employees' well-being in the downstream oil and gas production sector to establish a sustainable governance system. Understanding the inherent factors better that contribute to safety behavior management could significantly improve workplace safety features. ObjectiveThis study investigates employees' safety behavior management model for the downstream oil and gas industry to consolidate the safety, health and wellbeing of employees in times of COVID-19. MethodsNominal Group Technique (NGT) was first employed to screen primary behavioral factors from 10 workplace health and safety experts from Malaysia's downstream oil and gas industry. Consequently, 18 significant factors were identified for further inquiry. Next, the interpretive structural modeling technique was used to ascertain the complex interrelationships between these factors and proposed a Safety Behavioral Management Model for cleaner production. ResultsThis model shows that management commitment, employee knowledge and training, leadership, and regulations contribute significantly to several latent factors. Our findings support the Social Cognitive Theory, where employees, their environment, and their behaviors are related reciprocally.

This research utilized a two-armed experimental approach (single vs dual-task paradigms) to quantify neural and biomechanical tradeoffs associated with short-term human-exoskeleton interaction (HEI) during asymmetrical lifting in twelve healthy adults balanced by gender. A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate dual-task manipulations.","[Zhu, Yibo; Mehta, Ranjana K.] Texas A&M Univ, Wm Michael Barnes Dept Ind & Syst Engn 64, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Weston, Eric B.; Marras, William S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Integrated Syst Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Weston, Eric B.; Marras, William S.] Ohio State Univ, Spine Res Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Mehta, RK (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",rmehta@tamu.edu,"Marras, William/AAJ-4998-2021; Mehta, Ranjana/AAE-3257-2020","Mehta, Ranjana/0000-0002-8254-8365",,,,,86,28,31,3,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

The companies involved in the project arc two Danish process industries and manufacturer of mass customized products. Based on extensive data collection and developed simulation models, new methods of optimizing resources in the manufacturing are tested including factors such as machine allocation, batch sizes, sequences, and product mix. The tree main factors in assessing the environmental impact have been waste, energy, and emission. The latter has been calculated based on energy consumption and the type of energy source.

By considering the overall context in which an explanation is presented, including the role played by the human-in-the-loop, we can hope to craft effective explanations. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the cognitive value of an explanation and describe its role in providing effective explanations within a given context. Specifically, we consider the scenario of a business owner seeking to improve sales of their product, and compare explanations provided by some existing interpretable machine learning algorithms (random forests, scalable Bayesian Rules, causal models) in terms of the cognitive value they offer to the business owner. We hope that our work will foster future research in the field of transparent AI to incorporate the cognitive value of explanations in crafting and evaluating explanations.","[Chander, Ajay; Srinivasan, Ramya] Fujitsu Labs Amer, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA",Fujitsu Ltd; Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd,"Chander, A (corresponding author), Fujitsu Labs Amer, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA.",ajay.chander@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-99740-7; 978-3-319-99739-1,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11015,,,,,,314,328,,10.1007/978-3-319-99740-7_23,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-99740-7_23,,,15,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BL8NX,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000456820700023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Manufacturers of colored products are expected to maintain high levels of color quality to perfectly satisfy the customers' requirements. The rendering of colors is visually checked by experienced workers, who may though show different color sensitiveness, depending, e.g., on perceptual, cognitive and cultural aspects. This often results in products that fail to faithfully reproduce what the customer asked for, with negative consequences for companies, as well as huge financial losses. This paper describes a neural network-based system to objectively check how faithfully colors are reproduced by an industrial printing process. The system considers a master color, then compares it to a copy, and returns an objective degree of color fidelity of the copy to the master. The neural system was trained and tested in a real-world case study by using a huge quantity of color pairs taken from the L*a*b* color space. Highly accurate results were achieved. The strengths of the system are that it can measure the difference of colors in a way that is incredibly close to that perceived by the human eye, and the fact that it can do that canceling the color distortion phenomena that may occur in the human vision.","[Lazzerini, Beatrice; Pistolesi, Francesco] Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, Largo L Lazzarino 1, I-56122 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Lazzerini, B (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, Largo L Lazzarino 1, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",b.lazzerini@iet.unipi.it; f.pistolesi@iet.unipi.it,"Pistolesi, Francesco/KTI-6486-2024","Lazzerini, Beatrice/0000-0002-5086-4734; PISTOLESI, FRANCESCO/0000-0002-1078-5599",Tuscany Region; Macs Tech S.r.l.,Tuscany Region(Regione Toscana); Macs Tech S.r.l.,"This work was co-funded by the Tuscany Region and Macs Tech S.r.l., under the POR FSE 2014-2020 programme.",,10,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2161-4393,,978-1-5090-6014-6,IEEE IJCNN,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BQ3NO,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000585967405004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among existing studies on driver assistance systems, few studies have used the concept of the levels of processing (LOP) to understand drivers information processing. This paper introduces experimental and computational studies that connect human behavior data to internal goal of a driver when an in-vehicle task involves visual search. In the case of consuming information displayed on a car instrument cluster, we considered two levels of information processing, perceptual and cognitive. Through an empirical study, we observed different human oculomotor behaviors that depend on the LOP by evaluating the reaction time (RT) and eye movement patterns. Further, we suggested different ways of information processing that can be represented as different routes in the underlying cognitive architecture of a queueing network. Simulation study demonstrated that trends in simulated oculomotor behavior were similar to those observed in the experiment, that is, RT at the cognitive LOP was shorter than that at the perceptual LOP, while eyes fixated for shorter duration and with lower frequency. In terms of application, this study reveals the possibility of using human-generated data for evaluating the innate purposes of drivers. Together with further development of sensors and invasive computing, the approach proposed in this paper could assist the realization of cognitive cars by understanding drivers' intent using eye tracking technology.","[Rhie, Ye Lim; Yun, Myung Hwan] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Rhie, Ye Lim] Agcy Def Dev, KR-305152 Daejeon, South Korea","Seoul National University (SNU); Agency of Defense Development (ADD), Republic of Korea",,bsinitsaz@gmail.com; smilelim@gmail.com; mhy@snu.ac.kr,,"Yun, Myung Hwan/0000-0001-8554-3132",Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies [NRF - 2012R1A1A30110320],Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies(Korean Federation of Science & Technology Societies (KOFST)),This work was supported by the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies under Grant NRF - 2012R1A1A30110320.

Most of these models were developed for the nuclear, military, and aviation sectors. These methods have the following weaknesses that limit their use in industry: the lack of analysis of underlying causal cognitive mechanisms, need of retrospective data for implementation, strong dependence on expert judgment, focus on a particular type of error, and/or analysis of operator behaviour and decision-making without considering the role of the system in such decisions. The purpose of the present research is to develop a qualitative prospective methodology that does not depend exclusively on retrospective information, that does not require expert judgment for implementation and that allows predicting potential sequences of accidents before they occur. It has been proposed for new (or existent) small and medium- scale facilities, whose processes are simple. To the best of our knowledge, a methodology that meets these requirements has not been reported in literature thus far. The methodology proposed in this study was applied to the methanol storage area of a biodiesel facility. It could predict potential sequences of accidents, through the analysis of information provided by different system devices and the study of the possible deviations of operators in decision-making. It also enabled the identification of the shortcomings in the human-machine interface and proposed an optimization of the current configuration.","[Calvo Olivares, Romina D.; Rivera, Selva S.; Nunez Mc Leod, Jorge E.] Cuyo Natl Univ, Engn Fac, CEDIAC, Ctr Univ, CO M5502JMA, Mendoza, Argentina; [Calvo Olivares, Romina D.; Nunez Mc Leod, Jorge E.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University Nacional Cuyo Mendoza; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Olivares, RDC (corresponding author), Cuyo Natl Univ, Engn Fac, Ctr Univ, CO M5502JMA, Mendoza, Argentina.",rcalvo@cediac.uncu.edu.ar; srivera@cediac.uncu.edu.ar; jnmcleod@cediac.uncu.edu.ar,,"Rivera, Selva Soledad/0000-0003-4248-6945","CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas); project of SeCTyP (Secretaria de Ciencia, Tecnologia y Posgrado, National University of Cuyo, Argentina)","CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); project of SeCTyP (Secretaria de Ciencia, Tecnologia y Posgrado, National University of Cuyo, Argentina)","This work was supported in part by a PhD scholarship and a postdoctoral fellowship awarded by CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas), and by funding from a project of SeCTyP (Secretaria de Ciencia, Tecnologia y Posgrado, National University of Cuyo, Argentina).",,89,11,14,4,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

However, significant obstacles such as disease outbreaks and inaccurate biomass estimation underscore the need for optimized solutions. This paper proposes Fish-Sense, a deep learning-based pipeline inspired by the human visual system's ability to recognize and classify objects, developed in conjunction with fish farms, aiming to enhance disease detection and biomass estimation in the aquaculture industry. Our automated framework is two-pronged: one module for biomass estimation using deep learning algorithms to segment fish, classify species, and estimate biomass; and another for disease symptom detection symptoms, employing deep learning algorithms to classify fish into healthy and unhealthy categories, and subsequently identifying symptoms and locations of bacterial infections if a fish is classified as unhealthy. To overcome data scarcity in this field, we have created four novel real-world datasets for fish segmentation, health classification, species classification, and fish part segmentation. Our biomass estimation algorithms demonstrated substantial accuracy across five species, and the health classification. These algorithms provide a foundation for the development of industrial software solutions to improve fish health monitoring in aquaculture farms. Our integrated pipeline facilitates the transition from research to real-world applications, potentially encouraging responsible aquaculture practices. Nevertheless, these advancements must be seen as part of a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving the aquaculture industry's sustainability and efficiency, in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals' evolving interpretations.

The dynamics for human-robot co-manipulation of objects was derived that included human's weight perception. An admittance control scheme with position feedback and velocity controller was derived using the weight-perception-based dynamics. Human subjects lifted objects with the PARS, and human-robot interactions (HRI) and system characteristics were analyzed. HRI was expressed in terms of physical HRI (maneuverability, motion, safety, stability, and naturalness) and cognitive HRI (trust and workload), and performance was expressed in terms of manipulation efficiency and precision. A constrained optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimum HRI and performance. Results showed that inclusion of weight perception in the dynamics and control was effective to produce optimum HRI and performance for a set of hard constraints. In the second step, a novel variable admittance control algorithm was proposed, which enhanced the physical HRI, trust, precision and efficiency by 34.63%, 31.86%, 3.85% and 4.92% respectively, and reduced cognitive workload by 35.36%, and helped achieve optimum HRI and performance for a set of soft constraints.

Despite the large body of research works already reported, current key technological challenges include those of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy. Towards this direction, a novel cognitive architecture for multi-agent LfD robotic learning is introduced in this paper, targeting to enable the reliable deployment of open, scalable and expandable robotic systems in large-scale and complex environments. In particular, the designed architecture capitalizes on the recent advances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) (and especially the Deep Learning (DL)) field, by establishing a Federated Learning (FL)-based framework for incarnating a multi-human multi-robot collaborative learning environment. The fundamental conceptualization relies on employing multiple AI-empowered cognitive processes (implementing various robotic tasks) that operate at the edge nodes of a network of robotic platforms, while global AI models (underpinning the aforementioned robotic tasks) are collectively created and shared among the network, by elegantly combining information from a large number of human-robot interaction instances. Regarding pivotal novelties, the designed cognitive architecture a) introduces a new FL-based formalism that extends the conventional LfD learning paradigm to support large-scale multi-agent operational settings, b) elaborates previous FL-based self-learning robotic schemes so as to incorporate the human in the learning loop and c) consolidates the fundamental principles of FL with additional sophisticated AI-enabled learning methodologies for modelling the multi-level inter-dependencies among the robotic tasks. The applicability of the proposed framework is explained using an example of a real-world industrial case study (subject to ongoing research activities) for agile production-based Critical Raw Materials (CRM) recovery.","[Papadopoulos, Georgios Th.; Antona, Margherita; Stephanidis, Constantine] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Comp Sci ICS, GR-70013 Iraklion, Greece; [Stephanidis, Constantine] Univ Crete UoC, Comp Sci Dept CSD, GR-70013 Iraklion, Greece",,"Papadopoulos, GT (corresponding author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Comp Sci ICS, GR-70013 Iraklion, Greece.",gepapado@ics.forth.gr,,"Antona, Margherita/0000-0003-3208-3755; Stephanidis, Constantine/0000-0003-3687-4220; Papadopoulos, Georgios/0000-0003-1686-421X",ICS-FORTH internal Research and Technological Development (RTD) Programme 'Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments,ICS-FORTH internal Research and Technological Development (RTD) Programme 'Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments,This work was supported by the ICS-FORTH internal Research and Technological Development (RTD) Programme 'Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments.,,88,11,12,7,40,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,9,,,,,,73890,73909,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3080517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3080517,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,TJ6NW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-11-15,WOS:000673596900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data were collected by four valid questionnaires (demographic formation, Maslach burnout, cognitive failure, and gen-eral health questionnaire). Then data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS The results of the analysis revealed a significant and rect relationship between burnout and cognitive failure (p < .001), and a significant inverse relationship was found between cognitive failure and physical health (p = .022). The other results showed that emotional exhaustion and depersonalization dimensions are significantly associated with cognitive failure (p < .001, p = .016). CONCLUSIONS According to the results of this study, burnout causes cog- nitive failures among factory personnel and on the other hand, cognitive failures affect the physical health of indi- viduals and lead to deterioration of physical health, which in turn can reduce a person's performance and reduce work efficiency.","[Chalak, Mohammad Hossein; Rafati, Shideh] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Social Determinants Hlth Promot Res Ctr, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Safari, Hossein; Zamandi, Mahmoud; Masruri, Batol] Iran Univ Med Sci, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Shahid Hemmat Highway, Tehran 1449614535, Iran; [Safari, Hossein] Zahedan Univ Med Sci, Hlth Promot Res Ctr, Zahedan, Iran; [Yadollahifar, Somayeh] Shahid Sadoughi Univ Med Sci, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Disaster & Emergencies, Yazd, Iran; [Chalak, Mohammad Hossein; Rajabi, Fatemeh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Hlth, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran",Iran University of Medical Sciences; Zahedan University of Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences,"Safari, H (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Shahid Hemmat Highway, Tehran 1449614535, Iran.",jafari.h3209@gmail.com,"Rafati, Shideh/ABB-3051-2020; Safari, Hossein/F-2755-2018; Rajabi, Fatemeh/CAH-5614-2022","Rafati, Shideh/0000-0003-3461-0555; Jafari, Hossein/0000-0002-0159-8214",Iran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services,Iran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services,This project was carried out with the ethics code 32671-193-01-97 and with the financial support of Iran University of Medical Sciences and Health Services and the participation of managers and staff of Iran Tire Factory.

These experts frequently use visual programming languages based on standards such as IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499. The standards apply model-based engineering concepts to abstract from hardware and low-level communication. Developing industrial control software is challenging due to the fact that control systems are usually unique and need to be maintained for many years. The arising challenges, together with the growing complexity of control software, require very usable model-based development environments for visual programming languages. However, so far only little empirical research exists on the practical usefulness of such environments, i.e., their usability and utility. In this paper, we discuss common control software maintenance tasks and tool capabilities based on existing research and show the realization of these capabilities in the 4diac IDE. We performed a walkthrough of the demonstrated capabilities using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework from the field of human-computer interaction. We then improved the tool and conducted a user study involving ten industrial automation engineers, who used the 4diac IDE in a realistic control software maintenance scenario. Based on lessons learnt from this study, we adapted the 4diac IDE to better handle large graphical models. We evaluated these changes in a reassessment study with automation engineers from seven industrial enterprises. We derive general implications with respect to large-scale applications for developers of IDEs that we deem applicable in the context of (visual) model-based engineering tools.","[Wiesmayr, Bianca; Zoitl, Alois; Rabiser, Rick] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, LIT CPS Lab, Linz, Austria; [Zoitl, Alois; Rabiser, Rick] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, CDL VaS, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Wiesmayr, B (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, LIT CPS Lab, Linz, Austria.",bianca.wiesmayr@jku.at; alois.zoitl@jku.at; rick.rabiser@jku.at,"Wiesmayr, Bianca/AAC-3783-2022; Rabiser, Rick/B-8673-2017","Wiesmayr, Bianca/0000-0002-9512-5249; Rabiser, Rick/0000-0003-3862-1112","Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association","Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association","The financial support by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs, the National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development, and the Christian Doppler Research Association is gratefully acknowledged.

Along with this development, a rising concern is the relationship between AI and human intelligence, namely, whether AI systems may one day overtake, manipulate, or replace humans. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept named hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which fuses human abilities and AI capabilities into a unified entity. It presents a challenging yet promising research direction that prompts secure and trusted AI innovations while keeping humans in the loop for effective control. We scientifically define the concept of H-AI and propose an evolution road map for the development of AI toward H-AI. We then examine the key underpinning techniques of H-AI, such as user profile modeling, cognitive computing, and human-in-the-loop machine learning. Afterward, we discuss H-Al's potential applications in the area of smart homes, intelligent medicine, smart transportation, and smart manufacturing. Finally, we conduct a critical analysis of current challenges and open gaps in H-AI, upon which we elaborate on future research issues and directions.","[Shi, Feifei; Zhou, Fang; Ning, Huansheng] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Chen, Liming] Ulster Univ, Fac Comp, Newtownabbey BT37 0QB, North Ireland",University of Science & Technology Beijing; East China Normal University; Ulster University,"Zhou, F (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",shifeifeiustb@163.com; zhoufang@ies.ustb.edu.cn; liuhongler@foxmail.com; l.chen@ulster.com; ninghuansheng@ustb.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872038]; UK Royal Society-Newton Mobility Grant [IEC\NSFC\170067]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [FRF-BD-18-016A],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); UK Royal Society-Newton Mobility Grant(Royal Society); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61872038), the UK Royal Society-Newton Mobility Grant (No. IEC\NSFC\170067), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. FRF-BD-18-016A).",,83,6,6,10,52,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1007-0214,1878-7606,,TSINGHUA SCI TECHNOL,Tsinghua Sci.

Linguistic terms are usually used to express the experiential knowledge of decision-makers in the above fields. However, cognitive nonconformity, fuzziness and uncertainty of experiential knowledge are widespread in industrial production processes, making it difficult for current FPNs to precisely model the experience or cognition of experts. In an effort to overcome the shortcomings of FPNs, linguistic Petri nets (LPNs) are proposed based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets theory and FPNs in this paper. The extended TOPSIS (ETOPSIS) is proposed to fuse together the cognition of multiple decision-makers. An interval type-2 fuzzy ordered weighted averaging operator is proposed to improve the knowledge reasoning capability of LPNs. Two comparisons are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed ETOPSIS and LPNs. In addition, the KRR model for aluminum electrolysis cell condition identification (AECCI) is proposed and AECCI results show the proposed methods are efficient to embrace cognitive nonconformity and manage fuzziness and uncertainty of experiential knowledge.

The epistemological stance adopted in safety behaviour development in research design and execution has largely focused on empirical outcome-based studies. Using personalised individual diaries to record real time data of safety-related events, including social cognitive contextual details, this study, for the first time qualitatively explores employee recorded incidents, permitting the identification of perceived latent conditions belying cognitive errors. The study revealed the most frequently occurring incident types were unsafe acts (38%) followed by unsafe conditions (28%), with a greater proportion of near misses (N = 46) in comparison to actual accidents (N = 13). Also apparent were inconsistencies in formal and informal reporting processes. Skill based errors were the most prevalent recorded human error type associated with distraction, alongside incompatible work environments. Violations were evident, to a lesser degree of recordable incidents. Across all human error types, qualitative accounts of safety climate concepts including leader violations and quality of leadership were described. The study thus made possible the capture of day-to-day safety behaviours and conditions, illuminating new perspectives on meaningful issues at both individual and systems levels. Adopting a systematically tailored approach to the exploration of suboptimal safety behaviour aetiology, there is a greater likelihood of knowledge acquisition of incidents or symptoms at an organisational level, which are then equipped to reflexively respond with a tailored address of these issues 'in situ'.","[Pickup, Sarah; Paton, Kevin; Hayes, Catherine; Morrison, Ben] Univ Sunderland, Sch Psychol, Sunderland, Durham, England; [Hayes, Catherine] Univ Sunderland, Sch Nursing & Healthcare Sci, Sunderland, Durham, England; [Hayes, Catherine] Univ Sunderland, Sunderland, Durham, England; [Hayes, Catherine] Univ Cumbria, Higher Educ, Carlisle, England",University of Sunderland; University of Sunderland; University of Sunderland; University of Cumbria,"Pickup, S (corresponding author), Univ Sunderland, Sch Psychol, Sunderland, Durham, England.",sarah.pickup@sunderland.ac.uk,"Hayes, Catherine/JWO-7949-2024",,,,,,89,5,6,4,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

The use of fuzzy techniques is necessitated by the fact that medical data is often ambiguous. This study desires to show the decision-making application of a novel Pythagorean Fuzzy Cognitive Map (PFCM) in the treatment of pregnant women with heart disease. The PFCM integrates the principles of Pythagorean fuzzy sets with cognitive maps, resulting in a better intuitive model for human understanding. PFCM combines Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, determining weights for expert opinions and criteria. It yields a fuzzy cognitive map with weighted linkages to visualize relationship strengths. To measure the impact of the PFCM, we conduct a hypothetical case study in which women were assumed to have cardiovascular disease. We gathered input values, diagnosis, and prognosis data and used them to design an algorithm that demonstrates the complete working of the system. After completing the algorithm, we validate the model using some example values and compared the accuracy obtained with other techniques. Our findings show that the PFCM is a highly accurate and effective tool for decision-making in the treatment of pregnant women with heart disease.

Because the cognitive mechanisms such as human sensation and perception from cognitive science are fast responses ranging from a few milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, the method of pattern recognition and analysis of these brain signals must be done and it is necessary to derive some information. In this paper, we investigated time-series data of cognitive function of the brain obtained using a non-invasive technique on multiple channels via signal classification and analysis, using a cognitive science approach and experiments. The test dataset was collected in 19 channels using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques with multiple rests and working conditions on eight subjects. From this perspective, the main contributions of this paper are that it completes the collection and analysis of cognitive-scientific time-series data and has scientific implications that extend to other integrated domains, energy, manufacturing, bioinformatics, and finance area. The use of Shapelet and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) classification techniques on brain signal time-series shows the potential to identify neuro-biological phenomena that can proactively signal a disease or disorder.

The 4th industrial revolution has given new opportunities for the development of and use of intelligent decision support systems. With these technological advancements, key concerns focus on gaining a better understanding of the linkage between the technicians' knowledge and the intelligent decision support systems. The research reported in this study has two primary objectives. (1) To propose a theoretical model that links technicians' knowledge and intelligent decision support systems, and (2) to present a use case how to apply the theoretical model. The foundation of the new model builds upon two main streams of study in the decision support literature: distribution of knowledge among different agents, and collaboration of knowledge for reaching a shared goal. This study resulted in the identification of two main gaps: firstly, there must be a greater focus upon the technicians' knowledge; secondly, technicians need assistance to maintain their focus on the big picture. We used the cognitive fit theory, and the theory of distributed situation awareness to propose the new theoretical model called distributed collaborative awareness model. The model considers both explicit and implicit knowledge and accommodates the dynamic challenges involved in operational level maintenance. As an application of this model, we identify and recommend some technological developments required in augmented reality based maintenance decision support.","[Illankoon, Prasanna; Tretten, Phillip] Lulea Univ Technol, Div Operat & Maintenance Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology,"Illankoon, P (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Div Operat & Maintenance Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",prasanna.illankoon@ltu.se,"Tretten, Phillip/M-6647-2015; Illankoon, Prasanna/AAI-2089-2020","Illankoon, Prasanna/0000-0001-8693-3431",Lulea University of Technology; Lulea Railway Research Center (JVTC),Lulea University of Technology; Lulea Railway Research Center (JVTC),Open access funding provided by Lulea University of Technology.

In particular, human-induced errors, alone or together with other factors, are determined as the main factor in the vast majority of accidents. In this study, some theories and methods that include human errors are examined.

In the present multi-factorial experiment, we examined the effects of information complexity and presentation as a key aspect of usability with consideration of human factors on decision quality. By using alphanumeric tables of simulated ERP system data to make a decision, users' decision quality dropped with increasing information complexity and the use of a poor presentation. Furthermore, interactive effects of two different aspects of information complexity (data amount and task complexity) as well as compensatory effects through human factors were revealed. These findings show the importance of empirical user studies in this field and provide several practical implication.

Specifically the presented research demonstrates the usefulness of Sussmann and Vecchio (1982) social influence interpretation of worker motivation to understand safety motivation. Survey data was collected from 428 employees in seven factories within the electronics industry in China. The data were analyzed using structural modelling. The results suggest that factory workers with more knowledge about the products, organization, goals/objectives and customers of the factory engage in safer work behavior. From social influence theory this may be understood as a process of identification, where factory workers through their involvement and increased knowledge of the factory are socially committed and influenced to work safely via their increased attractiveness of membership in the organization. This complements existing research and shows how other types of knowledge not directly related to safety knowledge may be important for improving safe work behavior. Another finding from the presented research indicate that the total effects of a factory workers experience with safety and health problems seems to affect safe work behavior negatively, and that this is caused by a decrease in confidence and abilities to work safely. In relation to practical implications the present study demonstrate how manufacturing managers can purposely adopt value related; identity related and utility related interpersonal influence processes to influence and improve factory workers commitment to work safely.","[Hald, Kim Sundtoft] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Operat Management, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Hald, KS (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Operat Management, Solbjerg Plads 3, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",ksh.om@cbs.dk,"Hald, Kim/K-1294-2019","Hald, Kim Sundtoft/0000-0002-4605-0156",,,,,77,19,20,5,97,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

This condition can result in decision fatigue and increased reliance on cognitive biases, which may compromise the decision-making process. To mitigate these risks, the implementation of decision support systems (DSSs) is essential. These systems are designed to aid operators in making swift, well-informed decisions, especially when their judgment may be faltering. Our research presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework utilizing dynamic influence diagrams and reinforcement learning to develop a powerful decision support system. The foundation of this AI framework is the creation of a robust, interpretable, and effective DSS that aids control room operators during critical process disturbances. By incorporating expert knowledge, the dynamic influence diagram provides a comprehensive model that captures the uncertainties inherent in complex industrial processes. It excels in anomaly detection and recommending optimal actions. Furthermore, this model is improved through a strategic collaboration with reinforcement learning, which refines the recommendations to be more context-specific and accurate. The primary goal of this AI framework is to equip operators with a live, reliable DSS that significantly enhances their response during process upsets. This paper describes the development of the AI framework and its implementation in a simulated control room environment. Our results show that the DSS can improve operator performance and reduce cognitive workload. However, it also uncovers a trade-off with situation awareness, which may decrease as operators become overly dependent on the system's guidance. Our study highlights the necessity of balancing the advantages of decision support with the need to maintain operator engagement and understanding during process operations.","[Mietkiewicz, Joseph; Leva, Maria Chiara] Technol Univ Dublin TU Dublin, Fac Food & Sci, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland; [Mietkiewicz, Joseph; Madsen, Anders L.] Hugin Expert A S, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Abbas, Ammar N.] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Data Sci, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria; [Abbas, Ammar N.] Technol Univ Dublin TU Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland; [Amazu, Chidera W.; Baldissone, Gabriele; Demichela, Micaela] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Sci Appl & Tecnol DISAT, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Madsen, Anders L.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Comp Sci, DK-9220 Aalborgost, Denmark",Softwarepark Hagenberg; Polytechnic University of Turin; Aalborg University,"Mietkiewicz, J (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin TU Dublin, Fac Food & Sci, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland.;Mietkiewicz, J (corresponding author), Hugin Expert A S, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark.",d21127042@mytudublin.ie; ammar.abbas@scch.at; chidera.amazu@polito.it; gabriele.baldissone@polito.it; anders@hugin.com; micaela.demichela@polito.it; mariachiara.leva@tudublin.ie,"Demichela, Micaela/O-8072-2019; Abbas, Ammar/HIZ-5718-2022","Baldissone, Gabriele/0000-0001-7015-8995; Demichela, Micaela/0000-0001-5247-7634; Mietkiewicz, Joseph/0009-0007-3109-5865; Leva, Maria Chiara/0000-0002-6770-8332; Amazu, Chidera Winifred/0000-0001-8788-3173; Madsen, Anders L/0000-0003-0633-9411; Abbas, Ammar/0000-0002-2578-5137",European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),No Statement Available,,59,3,4,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,FEB,2024,12,2,,,,,,,328,10.3390/pr12020328,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr12020328,,,33,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,JI5Z0,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-11-15,WOS:001172562000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Notably, the behavioral entropy of movement trajectories of users was identified as a reflection of workload and fatigue across different settings, including Virtual Reality (VR). In the context of VR particularly, this metric is predominantly derived from the movements of VR controllers, denoted as the Entropy of Controller Movements (ECM). Despite its promising sensitivity and unobtrusive nature as a metric for human workload, ECM's application and proven efficacy in practical and authentic VR-based applications, such as industrial teleoperation platforms, has not been validated yet. Additionally, current literature predominantly features younger experimental samples, leaving unresolved the potential impact of age-related alterations in motor performance on using ECM as a workload metric. This study explored these dimensions by examining the relationship between workload and ECM among 15 young and 15 senior participants who manually operated an industrial robot within a VR environment. Participants were instructed to navigate the robot through a pick-and-place task by using their physical movements in VR. Our research identified unexpected variations in ECM values, particularly in older users, revealing an inverse relationship between movement entropy and task complexity in our scenario. High levels of behavioral entropy were also observed in younger participants. These findings unveil some criticalities in using ECM as a measure of effectiveness.","[Nenna, Federica; Zanardi, Davide; Gamberini, Luciano] Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Nenna, F (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, Padua, Italy.",,"Nenna, Federica/AHA-0172-2022","Nenna, Federica/0000-0003-0353-6014",,,,,50,0,0,0,0,IADIS,LISBOA,"IADIS, LISBOA, 00000, PORTUGAL",1646-3692,,,IADIS-INT J COMPUT S,IADIS-Int.

Here, the relationships between secondary education (incorporating subject choice) and the reasoning and visual perceptual speed components of the Differential Aptitude Test are explored. Research purpose: The objective of the study was to determine whether type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice) could be used as a substitute for reasoning (verbal and non-verbal) and/or visual perceptual speed aptitudes in the selection of operators for an automotive plant in South Africa. Motivation for the study: The motivation for this study arose from the evident gap in academic literature as well as the selection needs of the automotive industry. Research design, approach and method: This research adopted a quantitative approach. It involved a non-probability convenience quota sample of 2463 work-seeking applicants for an automotive operator position in South Africa. Participants completed a biographical questionnaire and three subtests from the Differential Aptitude Test battery. The Chi-square test was used to determine the relationship between type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice) and selected cognitive aptitudes. Main findings: The study's findings revealed statistically and practically significant relationships between type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice), verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning and visual perceptual speed. Broad performance levels in the three aptitude subtests employed in this study were significantly associated with the type of matriculation certificate held by applicants. The findings specifically indicated that the secondary education types that included the subjects mathematics or both mathematics and science were associated with higher levels of performance in the three aptitudes. This had consequences for these applicants' success in the screening process which could lead to enhanced chances of employability. Practical and managerial implications: Applicants' type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice) could be regarded as a key criterion in human resource selection and be instructive in the screening process. This could reduce the candidate pool prior to more costly psychometric assessments. Contribution or value-add: The findings are specifically relevant to the South African automotive industry in terms of their human resource selection practices. The insights gained from the findings may also be used as a guide to human resource practitioners in the selection of similar level employees in other working contexts. The study makes a case for a multiplehurdle approach to selection.","[Puchert, Juliet I.; Viljoen, Kim L.] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa; [Dodd, Nicole] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Mil Sci, Ind Psychol Mil, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Fort Hare; Stellenbosch University,"Puchert, JI (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa.",jpuchert@ufh.ac.za,,"Puchert, Juliet/0000-0003-4546-299X",,,,,100,1,3,0,4,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-5200,2071-0763,,SA J IND PSYCHOL,SA J.

Psychological adaptations for producing things that early humans needed to survive and thrive, such as cognitive mechanisms for obtaining and processing food, toolmaking, and learning valuable working skills, evolved in the context of small networks of hunter-gatherers. These adaptations are central to understanding the significance of work in human evolution. Evolutionary mismatches operate when novel environments cue ancestral adaptations in ways that no longer provide adaptive benefits. We argue that digital work, although efficient and productive, is misaligned with some fundamental human needs, preferences, and routines, thereby illuminating a potential dark side. Yet digitalization also offers opportunities for matching the modern work environment to our evolved work psychology. We conclude with an agenda for advancing research in industrial and organizational psychology on digital work from an evolutionary mismatch perspective.","[van Vugt, Mark] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Colarelli, Stephen M.] Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI USA; [Li, Norman P.] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore City, Singapore; [Li, Norman P.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [van Vugt, Mark] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Expt & Appl Psychol, Amsterdam Leadership Lab, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Central Michigan University; Singapore Management University; University of Oxford; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van Vugt, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Expt & Appl Psychol, Amsterdam Leadership Lab, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.van.vugt@vu.nl,"LI, Norman/F-9075-2010","Li, Norman/0000-0002-4059-1613","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung [NLD 1212903, ADVANCE 101080323]; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung",Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),The first author (Mark van Vugt) was funded through a research fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung (NLD 1212903 GSA) and through a grant from Europe-Horizon on mental health in the workplace (ADVANCE 101080323).,,68,1,1,16,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2041-3866,2041-3874,,ORGAN PSYCHOL REV,Organ.

Multi-hop question answering over KGs-which aims to find answer entities of given questions through reasoning paths in KGs-has attracted great attention from both academia and industry recently. However, this task remains challenging, as it requires to accurately identify answers in a large candidate entity set, of which the size grows exponentially with the number of reasoning hops. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Deep Cognitive Reasoning Network (DCRN), which is inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DCRN consists of two phases-the unconscious phase and the conscious phase. The unconscious phase first retrieves informative evidence from candidate entities by leveraging their semantic information.

Working memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that deals with storage and active processing and is critical to a number of different processes. As a departure in construction industry research, this study correlates attentional allocation (measured via eye tracking) with working memory to assess workers' situation awareness under different scenarios that expose workers to various hazards. To achieve this goal, this study merges research linking eye movements and workers' attention with research focused on working-memory load and decision making to evaluate what, how, and where a worker distributes his/her attention while performing a task under different working-memory loads. Path analysis models then examined the direct and indirect effect of different working-memory loads on hazard identification performance. The independent variable (working-memory load) is linked to the dependent variable (hazard identification) through a set of mediators (attention metrics). The results showed that the high-memory load condition delayed workers' hazard identification. The findings of this study emphasize the important role working memory plays in determining how and why workers in dynamic work environments fail to detect, comprehend, and/or respond to physical risks.","[Liko, Gentian; Esmaeili, Behzad] George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, Sid & Reva Dewberry Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Hasanzadeh, Sogand] Virginia Tech, Charles E Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Dodd, Michael D.; Brock, Rebecca] Univ Nebraska, Dept Psychol, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",George Mason University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Liko, G (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, Sid & Reva Dewberry Dept, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",gliko@gmu.edu; besmaeil@gmu.edu; sogandm@vt.edu; mdodd2@unl.edu; rebecca.brock@unl.edu,"Brock, Rebecca/L-4570-2013",,"National Science Foundation [1824238, 1824224]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1824238] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1824224] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The National Science Foundation is thanked for supporting the research reported in this paper through the Decision, Risk and Management Sciences (DRMS) program (Grant Nos. 1824238 and 1824224).

Human working together with the robot at a workplace to complete a task may create unpredicted events for the robot, as humans can act unpredictably. Humans tend to perform a task in a not fully repetitive manner using their expertise and cognitive capabilities. The traditional robot programming cannot cope with these challenges of human-robot collaboration. In this paper, a framework for robot learning by multiple human demonstrations is introduced. Through the demonstrations, the robot learns the sequence of actions for an assembly task (high-level learning) without the need of pre-programming. Additionally, the robot learns every path as needed for object manipulation (low-level learning). Once the robot has the knowledge of the demonstrated task, it can perform the task in collaboration with the human. However, the need for adaptation of the learned knowledge may arise as the human collaborator could introduce changes in the environment, such as placing an object to be manipulated in a position and orientation different from the demonstrated ones. In this paper, a novel real-time adaptation algorithm to cope with these changes in the environment, introduced by the human factor, is proposed. The proposed algorithm is able to identify the sequence of actions needed to be performed in a new environment. A Gaussian Mixture Model-based modification algorithm is able to adapt the learned path in order to enable robot to successfully complete the task without the need of additional training by demonstration. The proposed framework copes with changes in the position and orientation of the objects to be manipulated and also provides obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the framework enables the human collaborator to suggest different sequence of actions for the learned task, which will be performed by the robot. The proposed algorithm was tested on a dual-arm industrial robot in an assembly scenario and the results are presented. Shown results demonstrate a potential of the proposed robot learning framework to enable continuous human-robot collaboration.","[Kyrarini, Maria; Haseeb, Muhammad Abdul; Ristic-Durrant, Danijela; Graeser, Axel] Univ Bremen, Inst Automat IAT, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Kyrarini, M (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Inst Automat IAT, Bremen, Germany.",mkyrar@iat.uni-bremen.de; haseeb@iat.uni-bremen.de; ristic@iat.uni-bremen.de; ag@iat.uni-bremen.de,"Ristic-Durrant, Danijela/AAY-3784-2021; Kyrarini, Maria/AAE-2453-2019; Graeser, Axel/GWQ-7634-2022","Ristic-Durrant, Danijela/0000-0001-9811-6615; Kyrarini, Maria/0000-0003-0968-2477","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), project MeRoSy (Human Robot Synergy)","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), project MeRoSy (Human Robot Synergy)",The research was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the project MeRoSy (Human Robot Synergy).

The present work is an attempt in this direction through a particular hybrid probabilistic model. The human error in industrial emergency model aims to develop an integrated methodological approach useful in critical infrastructures during an emergency condition. The proposed method, starting from the integration of existing techniques, develops a very flexible tool, able to take into account the main external and internal factors responsible of human error in emergency conditions. The model is able to estimate the evolution of human behavior and error following the evolution of the emergency scenario. The final result is a simulation model that calculates the contextualized human error probability, through which it is possible to estimate a realistic and detailed scenario of the conditions during the emergency management.","[Petrillo, Antonella] Univ Naples Parthenope, Isola Ctr Direz Napoli C4, I-80143 Naples, Italy; [De Felice, Fabio; Falcone, Domenico; Silvestri, Alessandro; Zomparelli, Federico] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Via G Di Biasio 43, I-03043 Cassino, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; University of Cassino,"Petrillo, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples Parthenope, Isola Ctr Direz Napoli C4, I-80143 Naples, Italy.",antonella.petrillo@uniparthenope.it,,,MiuR,"MiuR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This research represents a result of research activity carried out with the financial support of MiuR, namely PRIN 2012 DIEM-SSP, Disasters and Emergencies Management for Safety and Security in industrial Plants''.",,43,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1547-7029,1864-1245,,J FAIL ANAL PREV,J.

Tool condition is crucial to ensure the good quality of productsworn tools affect not only the surface quality but also the dimensional accuracy, which means higher reject rate of the products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify tool failures before it occurs on the fly. While various versions of intelligent tool condition monitoring have been proposed, most of them suffer from a cognitive nature of traditional machine learning algorithms. They focus on the how-to-learn process without paying attention to other two crucial issueswhat-to-learn, and when-to-learn. The what-to-learn and the when-to-learn provide self-regulating mechanisms to select the training samples and to determine time instants to train a model. A novel TCM approach based on a psychologically plausible concept, namely the metacognitive scaffolding theory, is proposed and built upon a recently published algorithmrecurrent classifier (rClass). The learning process consists of three phases: what-to-learn, how-to-learn, when-to-learn and makes use of a generalized recurrent network structure as a cognitive component. Experimental studies with real-world manufacturing data streams were conducted where rClass demonstrated the highest accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity over its counterparts.","[Pratama, Mahardhika] La Trobe Univ, Sch Engn & Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dimla, Eric] Univ Teknol Brunei, Mech Engn Programme Area, Fac Engn, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, Bandar Seri Beg, Brunei; [Lai, Chow Yin] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Lughofer, Edwin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Knowledge Based Math Syst, Linz, Austria",La Trobe University; University of Technology Brunei; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Pratama, M (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Engn & Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",pratama@ieee.org; dimla@utb.edu.bn; chowyin.lai@rmit.edu.au; edwin.lughofer@jku.at,"Dimla, Eric/AAM-3963-2020; Pratama, Mahardhika/AAG-3856-2020; Lai, Chow Yin/U-8733-2017","Dimla, Eric/0000-0003-1936-8684; Lai, Chow Yin/0000-0002-9632-6624; pratama, mahardhika/0000-0001-6531-5087",NTU start-up grant; Austrian research funding association (FFG) [849962]; Austrian COMET-K2 programme of the Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM),NTU start-up grant; Austrian research funding association (FFG); Austrian COMET-K2 programme of the Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM),"This work is fully supported by the NTU start-up grant.

Accordingly, this study intends to design a modern training guide/manual that could enable construction workers in a variety of job categories to enhance their work procedures, learning demands and responsibilities in relation to health and safety practices. The crucial factors/areas and Competency Elements (CEs) were qualitatively identified using comprehensive approaches. A series of industry consultation meetings/discussions were carried out with actionoriented communication approaches to develop training aims and learning outcomes based on the identified critical CEs. Expert reviews were conducted on the entire development process to validate the outputs. The study has produced a new training guide/manual that describes all the needed components of training to improve the cognitive and manual skills of construction workers, connecting with the key areas of the job roles and the legal framework, identification/assessment/control of hazards, conditions and risks in construction operations. The study has also produced a sample lesson plan which describes how the learning areas/contents are methodically linked to training objectives. The outcomes of experts' reviews assured the validity, reliability and generalisability of the developed training guide. The developed training manual/guide will be a functional tool that offers proactive and sustainable strategies to successfully integrate contemporary techniques/systems in construction projects, leading to standardising and reforming healthy practices associated with safety, quality and productivity. Despite the study findings can be directly applicable to the construction industry sector of Sri Lanka, other developing/developed countries and other developing industries/sectors can also achieve comparable outcomes towards upgrading their industrial processes.","[Kesavan, M.] Wayamba Univ Sri Lanka, Fac Technol, Dept Construct Technol, Makandura, Sri Lanka; [Alagiyawanna, A.

In this paper, we conducted semistructured interviews with 7 AI practitioners and 7 decision subjects from various decision domains. We found that 1) interviewees identified the prerequisites for the existence of trust and distinguish trust from trustworthiness, reliance, and compliance; 2) trust in AI-integrated systems is strongly influenced by other human actors, more than the system's features; 3) the role of Human-AI trust factors is stakeholder-dependent.

Due to errors, omissions, and misinterpretations, there remains a great opportunity to improve the traditional documentation of engineering information that craft professionals use to complete their work. Historically, physical three dimensional (3D) models built by hand provided 3D physical representations of the project to assist in sequencing, visualization, and planning of critical construction activities. This practice has greatly diminished since the adoption of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) and building information modeling technologies. Recently, additive manufacturing (a.k.a. 3D printing) technologies have allowed for three dimensional printing of 3D CAD models. A cognitive experiment was established to measure the effectiveness of 2D drawings, a 3D computer model, and a 3D printed model in delivering engineering information to an end-user are scientifically measured. The 3D printed model outperformed the 2D drawings and 3D computer interface in productivity measures.

While robots partially replace human labor, they improve production efficiency and accelerate the process of intellectualization. However, in the human-robot collaboration system, when humans and robots need to perform frequent collaborative operations, the execution of cobot actions is plagued by the robot's inability to know the trend of human behavior in advance, which in turn leads to decision delays or decision errors. In this regard, a cognition-driven robot decision-making method in a human-robot collaboration environment is proposed to divided acceptance, rejection and delay regions for decision values, and use a process of dynamic adjustment of decision values and region boundaries to simulate the human decision-making process to achieve robot decision cognition. At the same time, a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to optimize the decision boundary values based on the reward function to improve the cognitive efficiency and arrive at the final decision results as soon as possible. Finally, we take the assembly process of engine end cover as the goal of the cooperative task, and find that the efficiency is improved compared with the cooperative method based on attitude recognition.","[Zhang, Rong; Li, Xinyu; Lv, Jianhao; Li, Jie; Bao, Jinsong] Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Pai] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Donghua University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Bao, JS (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",1199074@mail.dhu.edu.cn; lixinyu@dhu.edu.cn; yuzheng@sjtu.edu.cn; c953749@163.com; jie.li@dhu.edu.cn; pai.zheng@polyu.edu.hk; bao@dhu.edu.cn,"ZHENG, PAI/K-7989-2012","Zhang, Rong/0000-0002-6468-5489",National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2019YFB1706300],National Key Research and Development Plan of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China),This work is financially supported by National Key Research and Development Plan of China (Grant 2019YFB1706300).

Human error identification methods have been used to identify the nature of the human errors and causal factors, and recovery strategies in many industrial domains such as the aviation, nuclear power and chemical processing industries. The Technique for Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors (TRACEr) is a human error identification technique that was developed for use in the air traffic control domain. In this study, the TRACEr was improved in the combination of the task features of the power dispatching and human information processing, and was used to identify the human errors in the power dispatching. A total of seventy-two incidents or accidents performed by operators were analyzed. The analyzing processing was carried out with the objective of classifying task error, identifying external error modes, internal error modes and psychological error mechanisms, and identifying the performance shaping factors. The performance factors analysis considered the time, interface, training and experience, procedures, organization, stress and complexity which may have an impact to the task and help to propose some recovery strategies.

In this paper we propose an optimization-based representation for shared autonomy in dynamic environments. We ensure real-time tractability by modulating the human input with the information of the changing environment in the same task space, instead of adding it to the optimization cost or constraints. We illustrate the method with two real world applications: grasping objects in a cluttered environment, and a spraying task requiring sprayed linings with greater homogeneity.

What human factors contribute to success or failure of a software? What software practices are used by the industry practitioners to achieve high quality of software in their day-to-day work? In order to conduct this empirical analysis a total of 104 practitioners were recruited to determine how human factors, misinterpretation, and miscommunication of requirements and decision-making processes play their roles in software success forecasting. We discussed a potential relationship between forecasting of software success or failure and the development processes. We noticed that experienced par-ticipants had more confidence in their practices and responded to the ques-tionnaire in this empirical study, and they were more likely to rate software success forecasting linking to the development processes. Our analysis also shows that cognitive bias is the central human factor that negatively affects forecasting of software success rate. The results of this empirical study also validated that requirements??? misinterpretation and miscommunication were the main causes behind software systems??? failure. It has been seen that reliable, relevant, and trustworthy sources of information help in decision-making to predict software systems??? success in the software industry.

A prototypical system was built upon a mobile eye tracker, that analyses the user's field of view, to recognize possible objects of interest, while simultaneously checking for gaze fixations. A twenty-one participants user study was carried out, which builds upon established hypothesis of a correlation between eye fixations and the relevance of objects and additionally shows that this relationship changes over multiple tasks and runs, revealing learning improvements and task difficulty. Both features are vital for a reduction of amount of the support an assistance system provides towards its users, resulting in an overall better user experience.","[Haslgruebler, Michael; Jungwirth, Florian; Murauer, Michaela; Ferscha, Alois] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Pervas Comp, Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Haslgrübler, M (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Pervas Comp, Linz, Austria.",haslgruebler@pervasive.jku.at; jungwirth@pervasive.jku.at; murauer@pervasive.jku.at; ferscha@pervasive.jku.at,"Haslgruebler, Michael/LQK-3076-2024","Haslgrubler, Michael/0000-0002-6817-9639",Attentive Machines (FFG) [849976]; EyeControl (FFG) [855419],Attentive Machines (FFG); EyeControl (FFG),"This work was supported by Attentive Machines (FFG, Contract No. 849976) and EyeControl (FFG, Contract No. 855419) and by previous work and user study support by Stefan Prenner, Lukas Riedler, Martin Schobesberger and Philipp Starzer.",,21,1,1,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-6390-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,265,268,,10.1145/3197768.3201520,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3197768.3201520,,,4,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BN0ST,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000473401500048,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on self-categorization theory, our research draws on speciesism as a vital cognitive factor to examine how patients' speciesism affects their acceptance of medical AI in different roles. The study adopted a positivist research paradigm by examining 249 samples of data collected during COVID-19 in China. The results indicate that patients with higher speciesism tend to have lower acceptance of medical AI in an independent role but higher acceptance in an assistive role. Furthermore, we verified the mediating effect of human-computer trust and the positive moderating role of human uniqueness perception.

By analyzing decision making within a given case context, this paper describes the nature of the investment through the lens of behavioral economics, causality, input-output (IO) equilibrium, and the general notion of depletion of executive energy function. To explore the interplay between these elements, the authors structure the case context via a morphological field in order to construct a fuzzy cognitive map of decision-making relationships relating to the multidimensional and nonquantifiable problems of IT/IS investment evaluation. Noting the significance of inputs and outputs relating to the investment decision within the case, the authors assess these cognitive interrelationships through the lens of the Leontief IO energy equilibrium model. Subsequently, the authors suggest, through an embodied energy audit, that all such management decisions are susceptible to decision fatigue (so-called ego depletion). The findings of this paper highlight pertinent cognitive and IO paths of the investment decision-making process that will allow others making similar types of investments to learn from and draw parallels from such processes.","[Irani, Zahir; Sharif, Amir M.] Brunel Univ, Brunel Business Sch, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Papadopoulos, Thanos] Univ Sussex, Dept Business & Management, Brighton BN19SL, E Sussex, England",Brunel University; University of Sussex,"Irani, Z (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Brunel Business Sch, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",zahir.irani@brunel.ac.uk; amir.sharif@brunel.ac.uk; Athanasios.Papadopoulos@sussex.ac.uk,"Sharif, Amir/AAX-4672-2020; Papadopoulos, Thanos/ABD-5724-2021","Irani, Zahir/0000-0002-6332-6118",,,,,55,14,15,3,54,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

The current industrial data classification models are problematic in terms of feature incompleteness and inadequate self-adaptability, insufficient capacity for approximation of classifier and weak robustness. To this end, this paper proposes an intelligent classification method based on self-attention learning features and stochastic configuration networks (SCNs). This method imitates human cognitive mode to regulate feedback so as to achieve ensemble learning. In particular, firstly, at the feature extraction stage, a fused deep neural network model based on self-attention is constructed. It adopts a self-attention long short-term memory (LSTM) network and self-attention residual network with adaptive hierarchies and extracts the fault global temporal features and local spatial features of the industrial time-series dataset after noise suppression, respectively. Secondly, at the classifier design stage, the fused complete feature vectors are sent to SCNs with universal approximation capability to establish general classification criteria. Then, based on generalized error and entropy theory, the performance indexes for real-time evaluation of credibility of uncertainty classified results are established, and the adaptive adjustment mechanism of self-attention fusion networks for the network hierarchy is built to realize the self-optimization of multi-hierarchy complete features and their classification criteria. Finally, fuzzy integral is used to integrate the classified results of self-attention fusion network models with different hierarchies to improve the robustness of the classification model. Compared with other classification models, the proposed model performs better using rolling bearing fault dataset.","[Li, Weitao; Deng, Yali; Sun, Wei; Li, Qiyue] Hefei Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China; [Ding, Meishuang] Hefei Gongda Vocat & Tech Coll, Employment & Entrepreneurship Guidance Ctr, Hefei 231135, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dianhui] China Univ Min & Technol, Artificial Intelligence Res Inst, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dianhui] Northeastern Univ, Key Lab Integrated Automat Proc Ind, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; China University of Mining & Technology; Northeastern University - China,"Wang, DH (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Artificial Intelligence Res Inst, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, DH (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Key Lab Integrated Automat Proc Ind, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China.",dh.wang@deepscn.com,"Li, Qiyue/GON-3433-2022; Wang, Dianhui/R-6289-2019","Wang, Dianhui/0000-0002-5356-7268","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62173120, 52077049, 51877060]; National Key R & D Program of China [2018AAA0100304]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2008085UD04, 2108085UD07, 2108085UD11]; 111 Project [BP0719039]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R & D Program of China; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work is supported in part by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62173120, 52077049, 51877060), National Key R & D Program of China under Grant No. (2018AAA0100304), Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2008085UD04, 2108085UD07, 2108085UD11), and 111 Project No. (BP0719039).",,44,7,9,4,56,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

The application of digital twin (DT) technology has bolstered the cognitive and decision-making capabilities in the context of HRC assembly. This technological advancement provides essential support for addressing safety concerns in HRC assembly processes guided by a human-centric approach. A personalised safety detection method for HRC assembly based on DT technology is proposed. This approach involves personalised modelling and simulation of real objects within the HRC process, establishing a collision detection model based on skeleton points. Subsequently, human motion prediction methods drive safety monitoring between humans and robots.

Thus, we provide a brief, representative and non-exhaustive review of the current research studies, in order to examine the effects, as well as the impact of VR/AR technologies on K-12, higher and tertiary education students' twenty-first century skills and their overall learning. According to the literature, there are promising results indicating that VR/AR environments improve learning outcomes and present numerous advantages of investing time and financial resources in K-12, higher and tertiary educational settings. Technological tools such as VR/AR improve digital-age literacy, creative thinking, communication, collaboration and problem solving ability, which constitute the so-called twenty-first century skills, necessary to transform information rather than just receive it. VR/AR enhances traditional curricula in order to enable diverse learning needs of students. Research and development relative to VR/AR technology is focused on a whole ecosystem around smart phones, including applications and educational content, games and social networks, creating immersive three-dimensional spatial experiences addressing new ways of human-computer interaction. Raising the level of engagement, promoting self-learning, enabling multi-sensory learning, enhancing spatial ability, confidence and enjoyment, promoting student-centered technology, combination of virtual and real objects in a real setting and decreasing cognitive load are some of the pedagogical advantages discussed. Additionally, implications of a growing VR/AR industry investment in educational sector are provided. It can be concluded that despite the fact that there are various barriers and challenges in front of the adoption of virtual reality on educational practices, VR/AR applications provide an effective tool to enhance learning and memory, as they provide immersed multimodal environments enriched by multiple sensory features.","[Papanastasiou, George; Drigas, Athanasios] NCSR Demokritos, Gregoriou E & 27,Neapoleos Str, Aghia Paraskevi 15341, Greece; [Papanastasiou, George; Skianis, Charalabos] Univ Aegean, Karlovassi 83200, Samos, Greece; [Lytras, Miltiadis] Amer Coll Greece, 6 Gravias Str, Aghia Paraskevi 15342, Greece; [Lytras, Miltiadis] King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Papanastasiou, Effrosyni] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Zografou Campus 9,Iroon Polytechniou Str, Athens 15780, Greece",National Centre of Scientific Research Demokritos; University of Aegean; King Abdulaziz University; National Technical University of Athens,"Papanastasiou, G (corresponding author), NCSR Demokritos, Gregoriou E & 27,Neapoleos Str, Aghia Paraskevi 15341, Greece.;Papanastasiou, G (corresponding author), Univ Aegean, Karlovassi 83200, Samos, Greece.",gpapanasta@aegean.gr,"Papanastasiou, George/N-4934-2017; Lytras, Miltiades Demetrios/ABD-5355-2021; Lytras, Miltiadis/P-8195-2016","Lytras, Miltiadis/0000-0002-7281-5458; DRIGAS, ATHANASIOS/0000-0001-5637-9601; Papanastasiou, George/0000-0001-9964-0427",,,,,82,146,165,19,289,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1359-4338,1434-9957,,VIRTUAL REAL-LONDON,Virtual Real.,DEC,2019,23,4,,,SI,,425,436,,10.1007/s10055-018-0363-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10055-018-0363-2,,,12,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,JB8RZ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000488844300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cognitive style was measured by Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire from four dimensions (Reflective/Active, Intuitive/Sensing, Verbal/Visual, and Global/Sequential). The results showed that cognitive style significantly affected diagnosis task performance, and had interaction effects with information acquisition method. Reflective/Active dimension had significant effect on diagnosis performance under Filter and Query-Filter combined interfaces (active participants performed better). Intuitive/Sensing dimension had significant effect on diagnosis performance under Query and Filter interfaces (intuitive participants performed better). Verbal/Visual dimension had significant effect on diagnosis performance under conventional Visual Search interface (visual participants performed better) and Query interface (verbal participants performed better).

Alarm management techniques consider the cognitive model of operators, but mainly only from a signal perception point of view. To develop a human-centric alarm management system, the construction of an easy-to-use and supportive HMI is essential. This work suggests a development method that uses machine learning (ML) tools. The key idea is that more supportive higher-level HMI displays can be developed by analysing operator-related events in the process log file. The obtained process model contains relevant data on the relationship of the process events, enabling a network-like visualisation. Attributes of the network allow us to solve the minimisation problem of the ideal workflow-display relation. The suggested approach allows a targeted process pattern exploration to design higher-level HMI displays with respect to content and hierarchy. The method was applied in a real-life hydrofluoric acid alkylation plant, where a proposal was made about the content of an overview display.","[Bantay, Laszlo; Abonyi, Janos] Univ Pannonia, HUN REN PE Complex Syst Monitoring Res Grp, H-8200 Veszprem, Hungary",University of Pannonia,"Bántay, L (corresponding author), Univ Pannonia, HUN REN PE Complex Syst Monitoring Res Grp, H-8200 Veszprem, Hungary.",bantay.laszlo@mk.uni-pannon.hu; janos@abonyilab.com,"Abonyi, Janos/O-2832-2013","Abonyi, Janos/0000-0001-8593-1493; Bantay, Laszlo/0000-0003-1948-6656",Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary,Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary,No Statement Available,,31,0,0,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Spending an extended duration of time in an isolated and confined environment could degrade the cognitive state and performance of the operators within a crew. In the context of Mars exploration or a Lunar base, professional tasks such as teleoperation will be performed, and therefore their outcome might be impacted by the crew's cognitive state. Previous studies have shown evidence of the impact that stressors associated to confinement have on behavioural patterns and sleep quality. This investigation links then the aforementioned stressors to task performance. Hence, in order to investigate whether teleoperation task performance might be impacted by the crew's mental state in a confined and isolated setting, a correlational study was run on data acquired from the Crew 206 of the Mars Desert Research Station (mdrs) (mdrs) in the Utah Desert. The participants were French students (n = 5, Mean Age = 21, sigma = 0 . 707 ) who underwent a confinement period of 3 weeks. Over these weeks, they performed 7 teleoperation tasks. The task consisted in the guidance of a rover for a sample collection on the lunar surface. Operator performance was measured by recording the completion time and the frequency of errors. The participants' sleep data were measured with the Dreem headband, a portable Electroencephalogram (eeg) (eeg). Only the sleep data from the night before each session were considered. Also, operator cardiac activity was measured during the teleoperation task using a Faros 360 electrocardiography system. Lastly, operator mood was assessed just before performing the task using a shortened version of the Positive and Negative Affects (panas) questionnaire. A Spearman correlation run on these data revealed several statistical correlations that uncover links between professional task performance, sleep quality and mood in a confined and isolated setting. Amongst them are notably significant correlations between sleep duration and task completion time (p = 0 . 6197 , p 0 . 01 ), the reported feeling of confinement with the negative affect component of the mood (p = 0 . 5797 , p < 0 . 01 ), the negative affect component and several sleep quality parameters (p = 0 . 4686 or 0 . 4944 , p < 0 . 01 ). In addition to paving the way towards a better assessment of the impact of confinement and isolation on professional tasks, linking these parameters with specific personality traits could help in the selection of candidates for future human missions, thus increasing mission safety and reliability.","[Calle, Eric Gil; Mimoso, Diogo; Pouzin, Norbert; Lizy-Destrez, Stephanie; Roy, Raphaelle N.] Univ Toulouse, SUPAERO, ISAE, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Institut Superieur de l'Aeronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE-SUPAERO),"Calle, EG (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, SUPAERO, ISAE, Toulouse, France.",eric.gilcalle@gmail.com; diogo.mimoso@gmail.com; Norbert.POUZIN@student.isae-supaero.fr; Stephanie.LIZY-DESTREZ@isae-supaero.fr; Raphaelle.ROY@isae-supaero.fr,,"Roy, Raphaelle/0000-0002-4258-8397",,,,,26,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2468-8975,2468-8967,,J SPACE SAF ENG,J.

In blue-collar occupations, the physical demands of manual labor have always been the major focus, but recent technological changes may come with higher demands on the intellectual capacities of workers. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to assess physical and cognitive demands that construction workers face. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a quantitative study using standardized research instruments. Construction workers of three German construction companies were asked to volunteer to participate in interviews (n=35) and a survey (n=30) that assessed the extent of physical demands and a variety of cognitive demands experienced by construction workers. Findings The results suggest that construction work is demanding in physical terms as well as in perceptual, psychomotor, social and cognitive terms. Using and updating specialized knowledge, giving advice and providing consultation, friendliness, assertiveness and reliability are important demands among construction workers. Research limitations/implications - Construction workers face an undervalued level of demands in their everyday work environment. As high demands can affect well-being and mental health, construction companies would greatly benefit from investing efforts into evaluating the multi-component demands profile of their workers and the impact on their health, in particular through the strongly increasing cognitive demands due to the ongoing digitization of the sector. Originality/value The study identified essential demands in construction work that are relevant for the workers' productivity and well-being.","[Rodriguez, Franciscsa S.; Spilski, Jan; Hekele, Felix; Beese, Nils Ove; Lachmann, Thomas] Univ Kaiserslautern, Ctr Cognit Sci, Kaiserslautern, Germany",University of Kaiserslautern,"Rodriguez, FS (corresponding author), Univ Kaiserslautern, Ctr Cognit Sci, Kaiserslautern, Germany.",frodrigu@rhrk.uni-kl.de; jan.spilski@sowi.uni-kl.de; hekele@rhrk.uni-kl.de; nilsbeese1@gmail.com; lachmann@sowi.uni-kl.de,"Hekele, Felix/JXX-0538-2024; Rodriguez, Francisca/N-4360-2018","Lachmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6901-5935; Hekele, Felix/0009-0000-5166-5318; Beese, Nils Ove/0000-0002-0878-5637; Rodriguez, Francisca/0000-0003-2919-5510; Spilski, Jan/0000-0003-4105-4585",,,,,75,18,19,9,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-9988,1365-232X,,ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA,Eng.

But, these two modeling paradigms are limited in the domains of multiple monitor environments. Although the schematic model based on neural mechanisms can represent human visual systems in multiple monitor environments by providing a detailed account of eye and head movements, these models cannot easily be applied in complex cognitive interactions. On the other hand, the cognitive architectures can model the interaction of multiple aspects of cognition, but these architectures have not focused on modeling the visual orienting behavior of eye and head movements. Thus, in this study, a specific cognitive architecture, which is ACT-R, is extended by an existing schematic model of human visual systems based on neural mechanisms in order to model human performance in multiple monitor environments more accurately. And, this study proposes a method of modeling human performance using the extended ACT-R. The proposed method is validated by an experiment, confirming that the proposed method is able to predict human performance more accurately in multiple monitor environments. Relevance to industry: Predicting human performance with a computational model can be used as an alternative method to implementing iterative user testing for developing a system interface. The computational model in this study can predict human performance in multiple monitor environments, so that the model can be applied early on in the design phase, to evaluate the system interface in multiple monitor environments.

The type of tool, amount of effort and form of energy required vary depending on the output; however they now enable industry to manufacture goods (with excellent quality and extremely high volume). Industry continues to invest heavily in machines so that people can operate productively. Similarly, researchers continue to pursue automation to increase the Degree of Autonomy (DOA) using Advanced Information Processing (AIP) techniques. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computational Intelligence (CI) and Machine Intelligence (MI) now facilitate automation for numerous achievements. The proposed Visual Landing Framework (VLF) design uses a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to facilitate the development of components, that interoperate, via embedded business logic, to deliver the coordination and cooperation techniques required to automate a higher-level cognitive processing problem. As technology incorporates this ever increasing Level of Automation (LOA), humans remain in charge and are retained to make higher-order decisions. Unlike humans, heuristic and declarative logic systems suffers under these conditions and to need to adapt or make human-like decision to succeed. This paper discusses one possible avenue of enhancing the DOA on a 'Tier 1' Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by reducing the need for the human to concentrate on a difficult cognitive task. The Machine to Machine (M2M) autonomy component uses an on-board camera, the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithms to translate a fixed ground reference into positional commands. With this increased LOA the platform should be able to generate greater independence and enable more autonomous behaviour within unmanned control systems. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In consequence, for the sake of addressing the hesitance and fuzziness of preference information for the configuration of tasks and resources in cloud manufacturing, a decision-making model of a two-sided matching considering a bidirectional projection under preference information of hesitant fuzzy is put forward. Primarily, this paper describes the problem of two-sided matching and introduces the hesitant fuzzy set. Afterwards, according to preference information given by matching agents using the hesitant fuzzy element, the evaluation matrix is constructed. Meanwhile, the bidirectional projection technology and TOPSIS method are combined to calculate the closeness degree matrix. Further, by introducing the constraint of the stable matching, a decision-making model of a two-sided matching for maximizing the closeness degree of two-sided matching agents is constructed, and the optimal configuration results are obtained by the solving of the model. Subsequently, the illustrative case is provided to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the presented model in solving the configuration for cloud manufacturing tasks and resources. Also, the stability in the proposed configuration results is illustrated by making a sensitivity analysis. Further, the reliability in the given solving process is demonstrated through performing a comparative analysis, as well as the advantages in the proposed model is also discussed. It shows that this developed model can give stable configuration results and also provide a matching approach for different agents under an uncertain environment.","[Li, Baodong; Yang, Yu; Liang, Zhichao; Wang, Sheng] Chongqing Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Su, Jiafu] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Chongqing Key Lab Elect Commerce & Supply Chain S, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Chongqing Technology & Business University,"Yang, Y (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",libaodong@cqu.edu.cn; yuyang@cqu.edu.cn; jiafu.su@hotmail.com; zhichaoliang@cqu.edu.cn; shengwang@cqu.edu.cn,,"Yang, Yu/0000-0002-4049-0265; su, jiafu/0000-0002-6001-5744; Su, Jiafu/0000-0001-9220-274X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571023]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [2018CDXYJX0019]; Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing, China [CYB19010]; theYouth Foundation ofMinistry of Education of China [19YJC630141]; Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission [KJQN201800832]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing, China; theYouth Foundation ofMinistry of Education of China; Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission","The author extends his thanks to the editor as well as anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

The main impact is that the PTC expert intelligent system fills in the gaps between the human and software decision making processes. This gap analysis is analyzed via empirical triangulation of rail worker data collected from its groups, individuals and the rail industry itself. We utilize an expert intelligent system PTC information technology application to both measure and to improve the alertness of the groups and workers in order to improve the overall safety of the railways through reduced human errors and failures to prevent accidents. Many individual differences in alertness among military, railroad, and other industry workers stem from a lack of sufficient sleep. This continues to be a concern in the railroad industry, even with the implementation of positive train control (PTC) expert system technology. Information technology aids such as PTC cannot prevent all accidents, and errors and failures with PTC may occur. Furthermore, drug interventions are a short-term solution for improving alertness. This study investigated the effect of sleep deprivation on the alertness of railroad signalmen at work, individual differences in alertness, and the information technology available to improve alertness. We investigated various information and communication technology control systems that can be used to maintain operational safety in the railroad industry in the face of incompatible circadian rhythms due to irregular hours, weekend work, and night operations. To fully explain individual differences after the adoption of technology, our approach posits the necessary parameters that one must consider for reason-oriented action, sequential updating, feedback, and technology acceptance in a unified model. This triangulation can help manage workers by efficiently increasing their productivity and improving their health. In our analysis we used R statistical software and Tableau. To test our theory, we issued an Apple watch to a locomotive engineer. The perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and actual use he reported led to an analysis of his sleep patterns that eventually ended in his adoption of a sleep apnea device and an improvement in his alertness and effectiveness. His adoption of the technology also resulted in a decrease in his use of chemical interventions to increase his alertness. Our model shows that the alertness of signalmen can be predicted. Therefore, we recommend that the alertness of all railroad workers be predicted given the safety limitations of PTC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the verbal protocols of 30 ID graduate students during conceptual design processes using Midjourney. To better distinguish cognitive styles, we segmented the protocols and encoded them into cognitive maps, ultimately identifying four primary cognitive styles: Associative Focusers, Focused Probers, Treasure Hunters, and Comprehensive Selectors. The cognitive maps also revealed that while GenAI notably enhances the frequency of reflections across all student groups, there are marginal significant differences between the cognitive styles. Additionally, two experts evaluated all design outcomes, finding no significant differences in novelty, diversity, integrity, and feasibility across different cognitive styles, indicating the balancing effect of GenAI on the design outcomes of students with different cognitive styles. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for further research on GenAI's impact on students, enhance understanding of GenAI's influence on design processes and outcomes, and offer insights for personalized ID education based on different cognitive.","[Liu, Huiting; Zhang, Xiyuan; Zhou, Jiangping; Shou, Yuancong; Yin, Yang; Chai, Chunlei] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chai, Chunlei] Zhejiang Univ, Innovat Ctr Yangtze River Delta, Jiaxing, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, XY; Chai, CL (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Chai, CL (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Innovat Ctr Yangtze River Delta, Jiaxing, Peoples R China.",2727983018@qq.com; tangyuan@zju.edu.cn; 22051368@zju.edu.cn; shouyuancong@zju.edu.cn; 2839621304@qq.com; dishengchai@126.com,,,The Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang [2023C01219],The Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang,"This work was supported by the Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang (Grant numbers 2023C01219), Data engine and intelligent technology of product creative design for manufacturing industry.",,82,0,0,17,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-7572,1573-1804,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

Heterogeneous and voluminous nature of research data created in biomedical laboratories make information management difficult and research unproductive. One such collaborative effort was evaluated over a period of four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in biomedical laboratories. Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system. Technology transfer experience in a complex environment such as the biomedical laboratory can be eased with use of information systems that support human and cognitive interoperability. Such informatics features can also contribute to successful collaboration and hopefully to scientific productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This type of interaction enables operators of all levels to control a collaborative robot intuitively in several industrial scenarios and use it as a complementary tool for developing their competencies. Our proposed framework has been tested with 29 users who completed various tasks while interacting with the proposed VA and industrial robots. Through three different scenarios, we evaluated the usability of the system for LTA-FIT based on an established system usability scale (SUS) and the cognitive effort required by the users based on the standardised NASA-TLX questionnaire.

To predict and model human performance, several complexity measures have been developed. This study aims to compare the convergent validity and predictive validity of three existing complexity measures, step complexity (SC), task size, and task complexity (TC), using operator performance data collected from an emergency operating procedure (EOP) experiment. This comparative study shows that these measures have a high convergent validity with each other, most likely because all of them involve the size dimension of complexity. These measures and their sub-measures also have a high predictive validity for operation time and a moderate-to-high predictive validity for error rate, except the step logic complexity (SLC) measure, a component of the SC measure. SLC appears not to contribute to the predictive validity in the experimental EOPs. The use of visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor (VACP) rating scales in the TC measure seems to be significantly beneficial for explaining the human error rate; however, these rating scales appear not to adequately reflect the complexity differences among the meta-operations in EOPs.

Background Workers in sociotechnical systems adapt not just their individual behaviors but also their collective structures in dealing with instability, uncertainty, and unpredictability in their tasks. However, conventional design approaches are limited in supporting adaptations in both workers' behaviors and structures, especially during unforeseen situations. The work organization possibilities diagram has the potential to meet these requirements, but its value for design has not been established. Method We present a case study of a future system for maritime surveillance that provides an analytical demonstration of the utility of the diagram for design and empirical validation of the impact, uniqueness, and feasibility of this approach in an industrial setting. Results This application results in a team design that is integrated with the career and training progression pathway of the crew in a way that maximizes the system's behavioral and structural possibilities for adaptation. Further, the approach has impact on practice, makes a distinct contribution to design relative to other techniques, and is implemented feasibly in an industrial setting. Conclusion The work organization possibilities diagram can contribute to the development of an integrated system design that supports actors' possibilities for behavioral and structural adaptation in a unified fashion. Application This research provides a basis for designing interfaces, teams, training, and automation that preserve a system's inherent capacity for adaptation.","[Elix, Ben; Naikar, Neelam] Def Sci & Technol Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Defence Science & Technology,"Naikar, N (corresponding author), Def Sci & Technol Grp, Joint & Operat Anal Div, 506 Lorimer St, Melbourne, Vic 3207, Australia.",neelam.naikar@dst.defence.gov.au,,"Naikar, Neelam/0000-0002-3356-0990",,,,,54,8,8,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

It extends previous work by investigating task- and age-related changes in success rates, latency to success, and solution strategies. Threeto five-year-olds had 10 min to retrieve a toy from either a horizontal or a vertical tube by manufacturing a tool from multiple materials. In the Horizontal Tube Task, success rates were high irrespective of age. Solution strategies revealed mainly second-order innovation (i.e., manipulating materials while retrieving the toy). In the Vertical Tube Task, success rates increased with age and solution strategies reflected mainly first-order innovation (i.e., manufacturing the tool before trying to retrieve the toy). In the Vertical Tube Task, children needed more time to find a solution, with first-order innovation tending to be faster than secondorder innovation. These findings demonstrate the potential of young preschoolers to innovate tools when given enough time, but also a high task-dependency of performance.","[Breyel, Sabine; Pauen, Sabina] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Dev & Biol Psychol, Hauptstr 47-51, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Breyel, S (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Dept Dev & Biol Psychol, Hauptstr 47-51, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",sabine.breyel@psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de; sabina.pauen@psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de,,,German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes),German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes),This study was supported by a stipend from the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes) awarded to the first author.,,58,6,6,3,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0885-2014,1879-226X,,COGNITIVE DEV,Cogn.

This paper describes a novel collaborative architecture for human-robot assembly tasks. The developed architecture is composed of four modules; face recognition, gesture recognition and human-like robot behavior modules are used to enhance the human-robot interaction, while the visual inspection module is utilized for quality control during the assembly process. A collaborative task consisting of the assembly of a box whereby the robot assists the human was designed and implemented on the Baxter robot.

In particular, for remote collaboration, flexible mechanisms such as authoring tools can be used to generate instructions and assist human operators as they experience increased complexity in their daily tasks. In addition to the traditional handicap of ensuring instructions can be intuitively created without having to understand complicated AR concepts, another relevant topic is the fact that the quality of said instructions is not properly analyzed prior to the tools being evaluated. This means that the characteristics of the visual content are not adequately assessed beforehand. Hence, it is essential to be aware of the cognitive workload associated with AR instructions to assert if they can be easily understood and accepted before being deployed in real-world scenarios. To address this, we focused on AR during sessions of remote guidance. Based on a participatory process with domain experts from the industry sector, a prototype for creating AR-based instructions was developed, and a user study with two parts was conducted: (1) first, a set of step-by-step instructions was produced, and their visual characteristics were evaluated by 129 participants based on a set of relevant dimensions; (2) afterward, these instructions were used by nine participants to understand if they could be used to assist on-site collaborators during real-life remote maintenance tasks. The results suggest that the AR instructions offer low visual complexity and considerable visual impact, clarity, and directed focus, thus improving situational understanding and promoting task resolution.","[Marques, Bernardo] Univ Aveiro, DeCA, DigiMedia, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Marques, Bernardo; Silva, Samuel; Dias, Paulo; Santos, Beatriz Sousa] Univ Aveiro, DETI, IEETA, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ferreira, Carlos] Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT, IEETA, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Santos, Andreia] Univ Aveiro, DGeo, GeoBioTec, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Marques, B (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, DeCA, DigiMedia, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;Marques, B (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, DETI, IEETA, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",bernardo.marques@ua.pt,"Marques, Bernardo/AGY-4340-2022; Dias, Paulo/G-3681-2013","Dias, Paulo/0000-0002-3754-2749; Silva, Samuel/0000-0002-9858-8249; Marques, Bernardo/0000-0002-4454-710X; Ferreira, Carlos/0000-0002-2799-643X",IEETA-Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro - National Funds through FCT [UIDB/00127/2020],IEETA-Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro - National Funds through FCT,"This research was supported by IEETA-Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro, funded by National Funds through FCT, in the context of the project [UIDB/00127/2020].",,56,5,5,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2414-4088,,MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOG,Multimodal Technol.

Utilising type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice) could be a crucial selection mechanism for high-volume, entry-level technical positions. Research purpose: The objective of this research was to investigate whether the type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice) could be used as a proxy for psychomotor (dexterity and coordination) and/or spatial (ability to mentally assemble representations and spatial perception 2-D and 3-D) aptitudes in the selection of operators for an automotive plant in South Africa. Motivation for the study: The motivation for this study arose from the evident gap in academic literature as well as the selection needs of the automotive industry. Research design, approach and method: A quantitative approach with a cross-sectional research design was used with a convenience sample (n = 1566) of work-seeking applicants for automotive operator positions in South Africa. These applicants completed a biographical questionnaire and five sub-tests from the Trade Aptitude Test Battery. The Chi-square test was used to determine the association between form of Grade 12 qualification and selected technical aptitudes. Main findings: Statistically and practically significant relationships were found between type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice), eye-hand coordination and spatial visualisation. Broad performance levels in the five aptitude instruments employed in this study were significantly associated with the type of matriculation certificate held by applicants. Specifically, types of secondary education that included mathematics and/or science as subjects were associated with higher levels of performance in the five specific aptitudes. Practical/managerial implications: The type of secondary education (incorporating subject choice) held by applicants could be regarded as a key predictor variable in human resource selection. The study makes a case for a multiple-hurdles approach to selection and proposes a cost-effective preliminary screening method for low-level technical positions. Contribution/value-add: The study provides information to improve upon selection practices within the South African automotive industry. It could also assist human resource practitioners in designing selection processes for similar entry-level employees in other working contexts. The study makes a case for a multiple-hurdles approach to selection and highlights the reciprocal relationship between education and specific cognitive abilities in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.","[Puchert, Juliet I.; Viljoen, Kim] Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa; [Dodd, Nicole] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Mil Sci, Dept Ind Psychol, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Fort Hare; Stellenbosch University,"Puchert, JI (corresponding author), Univ Ft Hare, Dept Business Management, Alice, South Africa.",jpuchert@ufh.ac.za,,,,,,,91,0,1,0,2,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-5200,2071-0763,,SA J IND PSYCHOL,SA J.

Based on the job demands-resources model, cognitive appraisal theory of stress, and push/pull factors related to retirement, we proposed and tested a conceptual model of antecedents and outcomes of perceived work ability using 3 independent samples of U.S. working adults. Data regarding workers' job characteristics were from self-report and Occupational Information Network measures. Results from relative importance analysis indicated that health and sense of control were consistently and most strongly related to work ability perceptions relative to other job demands and job and personal resources when perceived work ability was measured concurrently or 2 weeks later in samples with varying occupations. Job demands (along with health and sense of control) were most strongly related to work ability perceptions when perceived work ability was measured in a manufacturing worker sample 1.6 years later. Perceived work ability also predicted lagged labor force outcomes (absence, retirement, and disability leave) while controlling for other known predictors of each.

Worker fatigue-impairment may be an underlying cause or major contributor to accidents. Fatigue-impairment is believed to be pervasive in construction, and research has shown it can be as concerning as alcohol-impairment. When fatigue-impairment is acknowledged as existing, there is poor understanding of its severity or how it contributes to performance and accidents. The purpose of this research was to attempt to measure fatigue-impairment in real time. Design/methodology/approach - This research expanded on actual measurements of fatiguerelated impairment from workers on a large construction project displaying significant fatigue-related impairment. The research identified and tested possible techniques for real-time measurement solutions to assist with this safety-related issue. 100 participants had their sleep/wake cycles monitored for a month with an actigraph to derive their on-going mental effectiveness levels by the minute. The same participants took cognitive tests over the month to compare mental performance results to the modelled mental effectiveness levels. Findings - Performance results from cognitive tests were compared with modelled mental effectiveness from actigraph-monitored sleep of 100 participants for a month each and showed significant correlation for all cognitive tests used. Practical implications - This research showed that real-time surrogate measurements for fatigue-impairment in the workplace exist to assist organizations manage an important workplace hazard. Originality/value - Derived from operational settings, this research developed predictive models based on simple, quick and inexpensive cognitive tests as screening techniques for workplace impairment and confirmed the need for and found a solution for fatigue monitoring in the workplace.","[Powell, Ronald I.; Copping, Alex G.] Univ Bath, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Powell, RI (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath, Avon, England.",ronald.powell@snclavalin.com,,,WorkSafeBC,WorkSafeBC,"The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the contributions of: Dr Gavin Shaddick, a Reader in Statistics within the department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath, as well as Holly Tovey, a student of Dr Shaddick's.

Despite the high-level stress of EM-CWs compared to native construction workers, the particular coping behaviors of EM-CWs is unclear. Due to their cultural differences, religious beliefs, and possible stigma related to sharing feelings, typical stress management strategies may not be effective in relieving the stress of EM-CWs. To manage the stress of EM-CWs and also to benefit organizational productivity, it is important to identify the specific coping behaviors adopted by EM-CWs in response to stress. Therefore, this study aims to explore the stress management factors of EM-CWs. Six focus group discussions were conducted, made up of five EM-CWs groups (three general worker groups and two skilled worker groups) and one group of foremen. Contextual analysis was used to analyze the focus groups' qualitative data. The study identified 11 items of stress for EM-CWs in two major categories: emotional and physical stress. In addition to problem -focused (i.e., planned problem -solving, seeking instrumental support, and cognitive appraisal) and emotion -focused coping behaviors (i.e., seeking emotional support, emotional discharge, and escapism), the current study also explored religious -focused coping behaviors (i.e., religious practice, service, and meditation) of EM-CWs. The findings advance coping -behavior literature by addressing important features of religious coping behaviors in the construction industry. The study explored the unique stress management factors of EM-CWs, which can be used to manage the stress of EM-CWs, improve their stress management approaches, and design various stress management programs for EM-CWs. Furthermore, several recommendations were made in initiating time management training, encouraging organizations to consider mental health needs in the construction industry, acknowledging the specific cultural context of EM-CWs, striving to reduce the stigma around sharing emotions under stress, facilitating an adequate on -site environment to practice religion, and introducing mindfulness programs to relieve EM-CW stress and improve their performance.","[Ahmed, Khursheed] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, NUST Inst Civil Engn, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Leung, Mei-yung; Li, Yueran] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; City University of Hong Kong,"Leung, MY (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",bcmei@cityu.edu.hk,"Ahmad, Khursheed/GXN-3952-2022; Li, Yueran/JJG-1665-2023; LEUNG, Mei-yung/K-4075-2015","LI, Yueran/0009-0007-7464-0982; LEUNG, Mei-yung/0000-0003-4186-2347",,,,,60,0,0,4,4,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1392-3730,1822-3605,,J CIV ENG MANAG,J.

An available means for preventing incidents is to recognize accident prone workers in a system as the last layer of working system. This study was conducted to recognize individual cognitive factors affecting unsafe acts among Iranian industrial workers as well as finding hierarchical relationships among the factors. This study was mainly performed in two phases including a seven stage meta-synthesis as a basic qualitative approach to extract the effective factors on unsafe acts of workers in industries and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) as an appropriate approach to modeling the factors hierarchically with a glance on their relationships. Twenty experts partook in this study from different universities and industrial companies in Iran to complete the matrices used in ISM model. Fifty-one papers were included out of which 10 dimensions were extracted as the main dimensions affecting unsafe acts individually. Kappa indicator was 0.69 indicating valid status of agreement for the extracted items. Lack of alertness due to mental overload and lack of individual's resilience were identified as the driving factors. The factor of difficulties in remembering work-related information had the characteristics of both independent and linkage clusters. The study provided a hierarchy of factors influencing unsafe acts; hence, the hierarchy could help all employers, industrial managers and even workers themselves to make a better decision when predicting workers' possible unsafe acts.","[Shakerian, Mahnaz] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Student Res Comm, Shiraz, Iran; [Jahangiri, Mehdi] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Hlth Sci, Sch Hlth, Inst Hlth,Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Shiraz, Iran; [Alimohammadlou, Moslem] Shiraz Univ, Fac Econ Management & Social Sci, Dept Management, Shiraz, Iran; [Nami, Mohammad] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Adv Med Sci & Technol, Dept Nuerosci, Neurosci Lab, Shiraz, Iran; [Choobineh, Alireza] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Hlth Sci, Inst Hlth, Shiraz, Iran",Shiraz University of Medical Science; Shiraz University of Medical Science; Shiraz University; Shiraz University of Medical Science; Shiraz University of Medical Science,"Choobineh, A (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Hlth Sci, Inst Hlth, Shiraz, Iran.",alrchoobin@sums.ac.ir,"Nami, Mohammad/AAL-6280-2021; Choobineh, Alireza/H-4554-2011; Alimohammadlou, Moslem/R-7854-2019; Jahangiri, Mehdi/F-2541-2014","choobineh, alireza/0000-0002-0866-0404; Jahangiri, Mehdi/0000-0002-4703-2523; Alimohammadlou, Moslem/0000-0002-9463-7285",Shiraz University of Medical Sciences [95-01-04-11410],Shiraz University of Medical Sciences(Shiraz University of Medical Science),"This article was extracted from a thesis written by Mahnaz Shakerian, a PhD student of Occupational Hygiene Engineering and was financially supported by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences grant No. 95-01-04-11410.",,98,22,23,4,78,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

These could widely assist older adults, independent living care, and medical care, by the data obtained from human activities. Since human behavior in reallife is extremely complex, assembling meaningful recognition is paramount. The performance of existing recognition models depends heavily on the datasets. However, it has constraints to acquiring datasets with rich information due to the limited budgets, the specific areas that can be used for human activity, the limited number of actors, and other ethical reasons.

Many of the causes of accidents relate not only to the OOW's knowledge and capability, but to his or her cognitive process. The cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) is a technique for analyzing human reliability. The CREAM organizes interactions between humans and the environment by using the human-technology-organization triad. The CREAM defines common performance conditions (CPCs), the dependencies between them, and the links between antecedents and consequences, thus clarifying the background factors that affect human performance. This method has mainly been used in the nuclear industry, but since conditions change across domains, CPCs apply differently to other domains. Based on the considerations above, we have adapted CPCs to maritime collision accidents, and administered a questionnaire to OOWs for the purpose of quantifying the dependency and priority of CPCs.

We present six grand challenges for the scientific community to create AI technologies that are human-centered, that is, ethical, fair, and enhance the human condition. These grand challenges are the result of an international collaboration across academia, industry and government and represent the consensus views of a group of 26 experts in the field of human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). In essence, these challenges advocate for a human-centered approach to AI that (1) is centered in human well-being, (2) is designed responsibly, (3) respects privacy, (4) follows human-centered design principles, (5) is subject to appropriate governance and oversight, and (6) interacts with individuals while respecting human's cognitive capacities. We hope that these challenges and their associated research directions serve as a call for action to conduct research and development in AI that serves as a force multiplier towards more fair, equitable and sustainable societies.","[Garibay, Ozlem Ozmen; Fiore, Stephen M.

Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector lack agility due to lower penetration of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), the inability to employ highly skilled human capital, and the absence of a formal innovation ecosystem for new products or solutions. In recent years, Cloud-based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM) has emerged as an enabler for product realization by integrating various service-based models. However, the existing framework does not thoroughly support the innovation ecosystem from concept to product realization by formally addressing economic challenges and human skillset requirements. The present work considers the augmentation of the Design-as-a-Service (DaaS) model into the existing CBDM framework for enabling systematic product innovations. The DaaS model proposes to connect skilled human resources with enterprises interested in transforming an idea into a product or solution through the CBDM framework. The model presents an approach for integrating human resources with various CBDM elements and end-users through a service-based model. The challenges associated with successfully implementing the proposed model are also discussed. It is established that the DaaS has the potential for rapid and economical product discovery and can be readily accessible to SMEs or independent individuals.","[Agarwal, Ankit; Mears, Laine] Clemson Univ, Int Ctr Automot Res, Dept Automot Engn, Greenville, SC 29607 USA; [Sorathiya, Pratik C.; Vaishnav, Shubham; Desai, K.

Furthermore, a mid-level SFC method was proposed, in the light of both cognitive and physical HRIs (cHRI and pHRI). On this basis, a hybrid low-level controller was designed for load-carrying exoskeletons (LCEs). Finally, the proposed method was simulated on an LCE.

In the shape design stage, design schemes are often presented through visual images. The presentation of visual images causes evaluators to form different cognitive experiences and evaluation results. In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in the field of industrial design, enriching the presentation forms of design scheme images. Although VR technology has shown the potential to improve evaluators' perception and cognitive experiences in product shape design, research comparing it with traditional methods remains relatively scattered. This study used two-wheel electric vehicles as an example to examine the difference in evaluators' cognition of product shape in VR and a real setting (RS). First, we established a semantic scale comprising seven pairs of opposite adjectives to evaluate the shape scheme. Second, we built VR and RS evaluation environments using head-mounted displays and paper renderings, respectively. The participants evaluated the vehicle shape design in alternating viewing and underwent semi-structured interviews on cognitive experience. We analyzed the experimental and interview results based on three aspects of product shape cognition. The results demonstrated that volume cognition was significantly more accurate in VR environments. Furthermore, graphic cognition, particularly regarding shape details, differed partially between environments. VR provided a better sense of immersion and more variable viewing angles than RS. Treatment cognition did not exhibit significant differences between environments, as it depended on human experience rather than visualization. These findings suggest that VR tools are more suited for shaping design evaluations early. Selecting suitable visual presentation tools based on evaluators' cognitive characteristics at different evaluation nodes to display design schemes is a practical, economical, and efficient strategy.","[Duan, Zhengjie; Zhou, Jiajun] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Art & Design, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Gu, Fangzhou] Changsha Univ, Sch Art Design, Changsha 410022, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Changsha University,"Duan, ZJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Art & Design, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",diana481@zstu.edu.cn,"GU, Fangzhou/IAM-7938-2023; ZHOU, Jiajun/GNP-1288-2022","Zhou, Jiajun/0000-0003-1135-4536","Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, China","Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, China(Zhejiang Sci-Tech University)",The authors would like to thank all the participants for taking part in the experiments.,,67,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1359-4338,1434-9957,,VIRTUAL REAL-LONDON,Virtual Real.,JUL 15,2024,28,3,,,,,,,136,10.1007/s10055-024-01034-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10055-024-01034-8,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,YT9F3,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001270848400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An important property that affects situation awareness is the limited capacity of the attentional system. To maintain situation awareness while exposed to tripping hazards, a worker needs to obtain feedforward information about hazards, detect immediate tripping hazards, and visually scan surroundings for any potential environmental hazards. Despite the importance of situation awareness, its relationship with attention remains unknown in the construction industry. To fill this theoretical knowledge gap, this study examines differences in attentional allocation between workers with low and high situation awareness levels while exposed to tripping hazards in a real construction site. Participants were exposed to tripping hazards on a real jobsite while walking along a path in the presence of other workers. Situation awareness was measured using the situation awareness rating technique, and subjects' eye movements were tracked as direct measures of attention via a wearable mobile eye tracker. Investigating the attentional distribution of subjects by examining fixation-count heat maps and scan paths revealed that as workers with higher situation awareness walked, they periodically looked down and scanned ahead to remain fully aware of the environment and its associated hazards. Furthermore, this study quantitatively compared the differences between the eye-tracking metrics of worker with different situation awareness levels (low versus high) using permutation simulation. The results of the statistical analysis indicate that subjects did not allocate their attention equally to all hazardous areas of interest, and these differences in attentional distribution were modulated by the workers' level of situation awareness. This study advances theory by presenting one of the first attempts to use mobile eye-tracking technology to examine the role of cognitive processes (i.e.,attention) in human error (i.e.,failure to identify a hazard) and occupational accidents.","[Hasanzadeh, Sogand] Virginia Tech, Charles Edward Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 121 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Esmaeili, Behzad] George Mason Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, Nguyen Engn Bldg,Suite 1405, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Dodd, Michael D.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Psychol, B82 East Stadium, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; George Mason University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Hasanzadeh, S (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Charles Edward Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 121 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",Sogandm@vt.edu; besmaeil@gmu.edu; mdodd2@unl.edu,,"Hasanzadeh, Sogand/0000-0001-6214-3443; Esmaeili, Behzad/0000-0003-3858-1843",University of Nebraska-Lincoln through a Research Council Faculty Seed Grant,University of Nebraska-Lincoln through a Research Council Faculty Seed Grant,"The research team thanks the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for supporting the research reported in this paper through a Research Council Faculty Seed Grant.

Considering this significance, the authors aim to formulate a cognitive workload monitoring system (CWMS) by leveraging the deep gated neural network (DGNN), a hybrid model integrating bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. In our experimental setup, each of the four virtual users is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W module to ensure efficient data transmission, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficacy of the monitoring process. This seamless monitoring framework utilizes the constrained application protocol (CoAP) and the Things Board platform to evaluate cognitive workload in real time. The most popular EEG benchmark dataset, the STEW is utilized for workload classification in this study. We employ the short-time Fourier transformation (STFT) to extract frequency bands corresponding to users in both high and low cognitive workload modes. The proposed DGNN models achieve a perfect accuracy of 99.45%, outperforming every previous state-of-the-art model. We meticulously monitored critical parameters, including latency, classification processing time, and cognitive workload levels. This research demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring for increasing productivity and safety in industries by introducing a novel method of real-time cognitive workload monitoring.

For this reason, this work presents an alternative interaction model based on a voice assistant, Alexa, which promotes more natural, intuitive, direct, and understandable communication. The purpose of this work is the development of an industrial safety system for a controlled electric motor based on Alexa voice assistant, which allows the monitoring of its operating parameters, such as phase current, housing temperature, and rotor vibration, as well as making it possible to control ignition and shut down and change the rotation of the motor with a prior password, as a safety measure. Commercial smart devices and Arduino-compatible modules were used to achieve this, providing them with the Internet of Things (IoT) feature. In addition, several software platforms, such as Blynk, Tuya Smart, Node Red, and Voiceflow, are used to perform data transmission, device management, and programming of the Alexa skill, oriented to the execution of the security and run system. This shows the potential capacity of voice assistants in the industry to deliver information more naturally to humans and obtain optimal notifications. However, problems were evidenced, such as the influence of noise in the environment when communicating with the assistant, the vocalization of words, low voice tones, and accents typical of the language, that will increase the security level of the system and prevent potential identity theft.","[Taco, Jaime Paul Ayala; Jacome, Oswaldo Alexander Ibarra; Pico, Jaime Luciano Ayala; Castro, Brian Andres Lopez] Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Dept Electr Elect & Telecomunicac, Sangolqui 171103, Ecuador; [Taco, Jaime Paul Ayala; Jacome, Oswaldo Alexander Ibarra] Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Res Grp Propagat, Elect Control, Networking PROCONET, Av Gral Ruminahui S-N & Ambato, Sangolqui 170521, Ecuador",Escuela Politecnica Superior del Ejercito; Escuela Politecnica Superior del Ejercito,"Taco, JPA (corresponding author), Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Dept Electr Elect & Telecomunicac, Sangolqui 171103, Ecuador.",jpayala@espe.edu.ec; oaibarra@espe.edu.ec; jlayala1@espe.edu.ec; balopez4@espe.edu.ec,,"Ayala Taco, Jaime Paul/0000-0001-5128-9084; Ibarra, Alexander/0000-0001-5916-776X",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Suppliers and customers are urged to get evidence for what they can do to reduce residual defects. Thus, it is meaningful to learn from historical data concerning the kinds of defects that have escaped from the existing quality assurance approaches and the factors that lead to the residual defects. A total of 3747 defects from 70 software systems developed by 29 Chinese aviation organizations were collected from acceptance tests during the last 5 years. For all these organizations, 38 domain experts from the industry assessed the process consistency to the standard built in the framework of Capability Maturity Model (CMM). Results demonstrate that the process improvement in the range of high consistency is effective in reducing total defects, as well as the minor and severe defects. The high consistency adoption of the practices in CMM Level 1 to Level 3 is more effective in reducing minor defects than severe defects. Causal analysis was performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Results reveal that individual cognitive failures cause 87% of severe defects.

Crowdsouring is an effective way to harness the capabilities of people (i.e., the crowd) to apply human computation for such tasks. Thus, crowdsourced data management has become an area of increasing interest in research and industry. We identify three important problems in crowdsourced data management. (1) Quality Control: Workers may return noisy or incorrect results so effective techniques are required to achieve high quality; (2) Cost Control: The crowd is not free, and cost control aims to reduce the monetary cost; (3) Latency Control: The human workers can be slow, particularly compared to automated computing time scales, so latency-control techniques are required. There has been significant work addressing these three factors for designing crowdsourced tasks, developing crowdsourced data manipulation operators, and optimizing plans consisting of multiple operators. We survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on crowdsourced data management.","[Li, Guoliang] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiannan] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Zheng, Yudian] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Franklin, Michael] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Tsinghua University; Simon Fraser University; University of Hong Kong; University of Chicago,"Li, GL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liguoliang@tsinghua.edu.cn; jnwang@sfu.ca; ydzheng2@cs.hku.hk; mjfranklin@cs.uchicago.edu,"Franklin, Matthew/J-8109-2019; Li, Guoliang/E-3481-2012",,"973 Program of China [2015CB358700]; NSF of China [61632016, 61472198, 61422205, 61373024, 61661166012]; Shenzhou; Tencent; [FDCT/116/2013/A3]; [MYRG105 (Y1-L3)-FST13-GZ]",973 Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shenzhou; Tencent; ;,"This work was supported by 973 Program of China (2015CB358700), NSF of China (61632016, 61472198, 61422205, 61373024, 61661166012), Shenzhou, Tencent, FDCT/116/2013/A3, MYRG105 (Y1-L3)-FST13-GZ.",,30,9,11,1,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1084-4627,,978-1-5090-6543-1,PROC INT CONF DATA,,,2017,,,,,,,39,40,,10.1109/ICDE.2017.26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2017.26,,,2,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BH8KI,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000403398200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Improving human-robot interaction (HRI) can increase the adoption of robots on construction sites; for example, increasing trust in robots could help construction workers to accept new technologies. Confidence in operation (or self-efficacy), mental workload, and situational awareness are among other key factors that help such workers to remote operate robots safely. However, construction workers have very few opportunities to practice with robots to build trust, self-efficacy, and situational awareness, as well as resistance against increasing mental workload, before interacting with them on job sites. Virtual reality (VR) could afford a safer place to practice with the robot; thus, we tested if VR-based training could improve these four outcomes during the remote operation of construction robots. We measured trust in the robot, self-efficacy, mental workload, and situational awareness in an experimental study where construction workers remote-operated a demolition robot. Fifty workers were randomly assigned to either VR-based training or traditional in-person training led by an expert trainer. Results show that VR-based training significantly increased trust in the robot, self-efficacy, and situational awareness, compared to traditional in-person training. Our findings suggest that VR-based training can allow for significant increases in beneficial cognitive factors over more traditional methods and has substantial implications for improving HRI using VR, especially in the construction industry.","[Adami, Pooya; Rodrigues, Patrick B.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Woods, Peter J.] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Becerik-Gerber, Burcin] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Soibelman, Lucio] Univ Southern Calif, Civil & Environm Engn & Spatial Sci Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Copur-Gencturk, Yasemin] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Lucas, Gale] Univ Southern Calif, USC Inst Creat Technol, Los Angeles, CA 90094 USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Becerik-Gerber, B (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",padami@usc.edu; borgesro@usc.edu; peterwoo@usc.edu; becerik@usc.edu; soibelma@usc.edu; copurgen@usc.edu; lucas@ict.usc.edu,"Copur-Gencturk, Yasemin/AAD-8648-2019; Woods, Peter/JVE-0799-2024; Soibelman, Lucio/JAN-5246-2023; Rodrigues, Patrick/HPD-6038-2023; Becerik-Gerber, Burcin/D-6897-2013","Soibelman, Lucio/0000-0002-8701-0521; Woods, Peter/0000-0003-3641-0848; Rodrigues, Patrick/0000-0002-2607-9955; Adami, Pooya/0000-0001-9624-3768; Becerik-Gerber, Burcin/0000-0001-8648-0989; Copur-Gencturk, Yasemin/0000-0001-8819-3035",National Science Foundation [1822724]; US Army Research Office [W911NF2020053]; Div Of Engineering Education and Centers; Directorate For Engineering [1822724] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Army Research Office; Div Of Engineering Education and Centers; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1822724 and the US Army Research Office under Grant No. W911NF2020053.

Hereby the factors examined represent decision situation and human (decision-maker) attributes. To help decision-makers in dealing with highly complex decisions several decision support tools, methods and systems (DSS) have been developed. One main disadvantage of DSS is the little adaptation to and integration of user needs and attributes. This paper aims in providing a multilevel stepwise approach for the management of human and decision situation attribute complexity in order to enable a more effective decision support. The decision support is tailored to adapt to decision makers individually and therefore a higher acceptance and use-rate of DSS can be achieved. The approach was developed using findings from literature research and results from several research projects performed in cooperation with industry partners.

In this work, we conducted semi-structured interviews in an industrial environment and analyzed the reported IE approaches and limitations. We observed that data science workers often follow an iterative task model consisting of information foraging and sensemaking loops across all the phases of an IE workflow. The task model is generalizable and captures diverse goals across these phases (e.g., data preparation, modeling, evaluation.) We found several limitations in both foraging (e.g., data exploration) and sensemaking (e.g., qualitative debugging) loops stemming from a lack of adherence to existing cognitive engineering principles. Moreover, we identified that due to the iterative nature of an IE workflow, the requirement of provenance is often implied but rarely supported by existing systems.

Here, we propose a modified CREAM method to predict human error probability in flight and provide some improvement measures for critical operations. A set of performance influencing factors (PIFs), such as flight procedures and ground support, is established to reflect operational scenarios in flight. Then, we develop the expected affect index of PIFs and the Scenario Influence Index to construct a quantitative model of human reliability. The probability of human error for each operation in the approach and landing phases is obtained with the modified CREAM method, and the results indicate that the most important cognitive function that influences human reliability is missed action. The proposed method may be a suitable tool for human reliability quantification in aviation considering long-duration flights. The method also has great practical significance for improving flight safety.","[Guo, Yundong; Sun, Youchao; Yang, Xiufang; Wang, Zongpeng] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Sun, YC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sunyc@nuaa.edu.cn,,"Guo, Yundong/0000-0003-0778-7806",National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1333119]; National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China [JCKY2013605B002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China,This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1333119) and the National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China (JCKY2013605B002).,,28,9,9,0,18,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-5966,1687-5974,,INT J AEROSPACE ENG,Int.

We use it almost anywhere, at any time, and for everything: to browse the Internet, to check our emails, and even to access critical services such as health monitoring and banking. Hence, its reliability and general quality is critical. As software increases in complexity, developers spend more time fixing bugs or making code work rather than designing or writing new code. Thus, improving software understandability and maintainability would translate into an economic relief over the total cost of a project. Different cognitive complexity measures have been proposed to quantify the understandability of a piece of code and, therefore, its maintainability. However, the cognitive complexity metric provided by SonarSource and integrated in SonarCloud and SonarQube is quickly spreading in the software industry due to the popularity of these well-known static code tools for evaluating software quality. Despite SonarQube suggests to keep method's cognitive complexity no greater than 15, reducing method's complexity is challenging for a human programmer and there are no approaches to assist developers on this task. We model the cognitive complexity reduction of a method as an optimization problem where the search space contains all sequences of Extract Method refactoring opportunities. We then propose a novel approach that searches for feasible code extractions allowing developers to apply them, all in an automated way. This will allow software developers to make informed decisions while reducing the complexity of their code. We evaluated our approach over 10 open-source software projects and was able to fix 78% of the 1,050 existing cognitive complexity issues reported by SonarQube. We finally discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and provide interesting findings and guidelines for developers.","[Saborido, Ruben; Ferrer, Javier; Chicano, Francisco; Alba, Enrique] Univ Malaga, ITIS Software, Malaga 29016, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Saborido, R (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, ITIS Software, Malaga 29016, Spain.",rsain@uma.es,"Ferrer, Javier/A-2498-2011; Alba, Enrique/KCZ-2486-2024; Saborido, Rubén/I-7001-2019; Chicano, Francisco/I-5650-2015","Ferrer, Javier/0000-0002-1074-0139; Saborido, Ruben/0000-0002-0944-5941; Chicano, Francisco/0000-0003-1259-2990",,,,,42,6,6,1,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,10,,,,,,11642,11656,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3144743,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3144743,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,YS0HU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-15,WOS:000750368200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Users of eHealth apps are naturally very diverse in terms of their human aspects, e.g., their age, gender, emotional reactions to the apps, cognitive style, physical and mental challenges. Unfortunately, many eHealth apps do not take these user differences sufficiently into account, making them ineffective or even unusable.Objective: This paper reports a study from eHealth app stakeholders' - developers and end-users - perspectives on critical challenges and benefits of better incorporating human aspects into eHealth app development and usage. We also investigate how different human aspects are being addressed by developers, which ones are the most important for different user groups, and which ones are currently missing/poorly handled.Method: A mixed-method approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative research was used for this study. We gathered and analyzed data from 240 online survey responses and 25 detailed interviews within the same study and validated the results.Results: We report key issues encountered in eHealth app design, difficulty in addressing different human aspects, areas requiring further research and practical assistance, and recommend our findings to best address these challenges. We found addressing human aspects throughout the app development life-cycle is beneficial for more effective eHealth apps. Our findings also suggest the need for improved standards and guidelines, better developer-user collaborative culture, and better human aspects education to produce more effective eHealth apps.Conclusion: This paper investigates current approaches used in the eHealth app domain that take into account the human aspects of app users. The paper guides eHealth app stakeholders, future researchers, academia and industry partners be aware of human aspects related challenges and improve produce apps.","[Shamsujjoha, Md.; Grundy, John] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Software Syst & Cybersecur, Melbourne, Australia; [Khalajzadeh, Hourieh] Deakin Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Fac Sci Engn & Built Environm, Melbourne, Australia; [Lu, Qinghua] CSIRO, Data61, Sydney, Australia; [Li, Li] Beihang Univ, Sch Software, Beijing, Peoples R China",Monash University; Deakin University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Beihang University,"Shamsujjoha, M (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Software Syst & Cybersecur, Melbourne, Australia.",md.shamsujjoha@monash.edu; john.grundy@monash.edu; hkhalajzadeh@deakin.edu.au; qinghua.lu@data61.csiro.au; lilicoding@ieee.org,"Grundy, John/AAF-1716-2019; Khalajzadeh, Hourieh/AAR-6188-2020; Lu, Qinghua/AAG-3378-2021; Li, Li/AAR-3316-2020; Grundy, John/I-6681-2012; Shamsujjoha, Md./U-8430-2017","Grundy, John/0000-0003-4928-7076; Li, Li/0000-0003-2990-1614; Shamsujjoha, Md./0000-0002-9459-5281","Australian Research Council [FL190100035]; Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) [DE200100016, DP200100020]; Monash International Tuition Scholarship; CSIRO Data61",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA)(Australian Research Council); Monash International Tuition Scholarship; CSIRO Data61(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"The authors would like to thank all the interview participants and survey respondents; without them, this work would never have been accomplished.

The pillars of the future wireless society will be the trustworthiness of the wireless positioning device and eco-friendliness of the transmission-reception process. These are triggered by the user needs, preferences and targeted applications, and by the type of the environment where navigation takes place. A link is still missing between these user needs/environment awareness (or application layer) and the physical layer where the wireless device is actually designed. The missing link can be created by cognitive approaches, borrowed on one hand from cognitive human behavior, and on the other hand from cognitive computing. Building a cognition stage between the application and physical layers will create a myriad of new possibilities for flexible location-based services and positioning-based applications, and possibly a new paradigm in wireless location research. MULTI-POS training network is bridging the gap between the lower technology layer and upper application layer involved in wireless mobile location. In addition, MULTI-POS will offer comprehensive training to young fellows in the broad field of wireless location, will create novel technologies and business models for the future location-enabled wireless devices, will promote the exchange of fellows in mixed academic-industrial R&D trajectories and in multiple European cultures, and will initiate an educational and research framework that unifies the currently fragmented research activities on technological and applications aspects of wireless navigation.

While this is practical for the automation of the process, it does not tap the full potential for optimal plant treatment. To more efficiently grow plants, specific treatments according to the plant individual needs should be applied. Experienced human gardeners are very good at treating plants individually. Unfortunately, hiring a crew of gardeners to carry out this task in large greenhouses is not cost effective. In this work we present a cognitive system that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for decision-making with robotics techniques for sensing and acting to autonomously treat plants using a real-robot platform. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to decide the amount of water and nutrients each plant needs according to the history of the plant. Robotic techniques for sensing measure plant attributes (e.g. leaves) from visual information using 3D model representations. These attributes are used by the AI system to make decisions about the treatment to apply. Acting techniques execute robot movements to supply the plants with the specified amount of water and nutrients. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In line with this, a team-based approach is generally adopted for task assignment to workers in construction operations. However, this approach tends to disregard the differences between skill level, experience, capabilities, learning rates and fatigue rates of different individual workers forming the team. In particular, due to differences in visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor capabilities of different workers and brain resource demands of different activities, the traditional approach may result in inconsistent workloads and uneven fatigue rates within a crew, affecting the workers' and crew's safety negatively. This paper proposes a novel framework for task assignment to construction workers in which safety of individual workers and thus the crew is ensured through optimizing workload distributions within a crew. The framework computes visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor requirements of the jobs assigned to a worker and minimizes the identified workload imbalances through collaborative execution of shared tasks. The application of the proposed framework is examined on a pipe spool fabrication operation of a refinery project in a simulation environment.","[Fini, Alireza Ahmadian Fard] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Akbarnezhad, Ali; Rashidi, Taha H.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Waller, S.

Another novel contribution of this conference paper is that these analytics are implemented in Neo4j expressed as Cypher queries. Various aspects of the cultural content and digital consumers can be naturally represented by appropriately configured vertices, whereas edges represent various connections indicating content delivery preferences. Early experiments conducted over a synthetic dataset mimicking the distributions of preferences and ratings of well-known movie datasets are encouraging as the proposed analytics outperformed the baseline of a multilayer feedforward neural network of various configurations.

A mixed reality (MR) integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping framework for immersive and intuitive telemanipulation of a complex mobile manipulator is presented. The proposed 3D immersive telerobotic schemes provide the users with depth perception through the merging of multiple 3D/2D views of the remote environment via MR subspace. The mobile manipulator platform consists of a 6-of-freedom (DOF) industrial manipulator, 3D-printed parallel gripper, and mobile base, which can be controlled by non-skilled operators who are physically separated from the robot working space through a velocity-based imitative motion mapping approach. This work evaluates the impact of depth perception and immersion provided by integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes on teleoperation efficiency and user experience in an MR environment. In particular, the MR enhanced systems maintain spatial awareness and perceptual salience of the remote scene in 3D, facilitating intuitive mixed reality human-robot interaction (MRHRI). This study compared two MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes against a typical 2D Baseline visual display method through pick-and-place, assembly, and dexterous manufacturing tasks. The MR integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes of teleoperation reduced overall task completion times by 34% and 17%, compared to the MR-2D Baseline, while minimizing training effort and cognitive workload.","[Su, Yunpeng; Zhou, Tony; Pretty, Christopher; Chase, Geoffrey] Univ Canterbury, Coll Engn, Mech Engn Dept, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand; [Chen, Xiaoqi] Swinburne Univ Technol, Mfg Futures Res Inst MFRI, Melbourne 3122, Australia",University of Canterbury; Swinburne University of Technology,"Chase, G (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Coll Engn, Mech Engn Dept, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand.",stevensu1838@gmail.com,"CHEN, XIAOQI/AAT-7406-2020","Chen, Xiaoqi/0000-0003-3227-4607",,,,,40,23,23,9,50,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

The use of filtering algorithms in smart city monitoring is a feasible method for this purpose. However, maintaining fast and accurate monitoring in complex surveillance environments with restricted resources remains a major challenge. Since the cognitive theory in visual monitoring is difficult to realize in practice, efficient monitoring of complex environments is accordingly hard to be achieved. Moreover, current monitoring methods do not consider the particularities of the human cognitive system, so the remonitoring ability of the process/target is weak in case of monitoring failure by the monitoring system. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel human short-long cognitive memory mechanism for video surveillance in smart cities. In this mechanism, a memory with a high reliability target is used as a long-term memory, whereas a memory with a low reliability target is used as a short-term memory. During the monitoring process, the short-term memory and long-term memory alternation strategy is combined with the stored target appearance characteristics, ensuring that the original model in the memory will not be contaminated or mislaid by changes in the external environment (occlusion, fast motion, motion blur, and background clutter). Extensive simulations showcase that the algorithm proposed in this article not only improves the monitoring speed without hindering its real-time operation but also monitors and traces the monitored target accurately, ultimately improving the robustness of the detection in complex scenery, and enabling its application to IoT-assisted smart cities.","[Wang, Shuai; Liu, Xinyu; Liu, Shuai] Hunan Normal Univ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Language In, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shuai; Liu, Xinyu; Liu, Shuai] Hunan Normal Univ, Xiangjiang Coll Artificial Intelligence, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China; [Muhammad, Khan] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Sch Convergence, Visual Analyt Knowledge Lab,VIS2KNOW Lab, Seoul 03063, South Korea; [Heidari, Ali Asghar] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Tehran 1439957131, Iran; [Heidari, Ali Asghar] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore 119077, Singapore; [Del Ser, Javier] TECNALIA, Basque Res Technol Alliance BRTA, Derio 48160, Spain; [Del Ser, Javier] Univ Basque Country, Dept Commun Engn, UPV EHU, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [de Albuquerque, Victor Hugo C.] Univ Fed Ceara, Grad Program Teleinformat Engn, BR-60455970 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [de Albuquerque, Victor Hugo C.] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Ceara, Grad Program Telecommun Engn, BR-60455970 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",Hunan Normal University; Hunan Normal University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Tehran; National University of Singapore; University of Basque Country; Universidade Federal do Ceara; Instituto Federal do Ceara (IFCE),"Liu, S (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Language In, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China.;Liu, S (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Xiangjiang Coll Artificial Intelligence, Changsha 410000, Peoples R China.;Muhammad, K (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Sch Convergence, Visual Analyt Knowledge Lab,VIS2KNOW Lab, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",liushuai@hunnu.edu.cn; khan.muhammad@ieee.org; as_heidari@ut.ac.ir; javier.delser@tecnalia.com; victor.albuquerque@ieee.org,"de Albuquerque, Victor/C-3677-2016; Liu, Yingbin/AAI-1919-2020; Del Ser, Javier/AAA-2965-2021; Liu, Shuai/AAB-1960-2019; Muhammad, Khan/L-9059-2016; Heidari, Ali Asghar/M-6255-2018; Liu, Shuai/P-3939-2017; Del Ser, Javier/J-2187-2014","Heidari, Ali Asghar/0000-0001-6938-9948; Muhammad, Khan/0000-0002-5302-1150; Liu, Shuai/0000-0001-9909-0664; Del Ser, Javier/0000-0002-1260-9775","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2020JJ4434]; Key Scientific Research Projects of Department of Education of Hunan Province [19A312]; Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Project Foundation [2018TP1018, 2018RS3065]; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Hunan Xiangjiang Artificial Intelligence Academy; Educational Reform Project of Hunan Xiangjiang Artificial Intelligence Academy; Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University [A1926]; Basque Government through the ELKARTEK Program [IT1294-19]; Basque Government through the Consolidated Research Group MATHMODE [IT1294-19]","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Key Scientific Research Projects of Department of Education of Hunan Province; Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Project Foundation; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Hunan Xiangjiang Artificial Intelligence Academy; Educational Reform Project of Hunan Xiangjiang Artificial Intelligence Academy; Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University; Basque Government through the ELKARTEK Program(Basque Government); Basque Government through the Consolidated Research Group MATHMODE(Basque Government)","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province under Grant 2020JJ4434; in part by the Key Scientific Research Projects of Department of Education of Hunan Province under Grant 19A312; in part by the Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Project Foundation under Grant 2018TP1018 and Grant 2018RS3065; in part by the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Hunan Xiangjiang Artificial Intelligence Academy; in part by the Educational Reform Project of Hunan Xiangjiang Artificial Intelligence Academy; and in part by the Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University under Grant A1926.

Therefore, the strategic planning of the SC's socioeconomic development requires as special scientific-industrial and cultural marketing analysis involving citizens in strategic processes (civic participation). Certain factors should be considered, such as the fact that SC strategic planning must be coordinated with the federal government and regional authorities, as citizens are demanding more accountability from the government and it is necessary to create conditions for networked group self-organization. So, SC strategic planning has become a transparent networked multilevel decision-making process where marketing analysis and civic participation are the challenge for Smart City strategic planning methodology. Under such conditions this paper aims to develop the author's convergent approach (CA), which would help to accelerate the networked strategic meetings by applying Situational Center, Cognitive Modeling, Genetic Algorithm, and Big Data analysis technology for the verification of cognitive models. This study is an attempt to address the issue of applying CA for accelerating SC strategic planning with civic participation and marketing analysis. To portray the issue of scientific-industrial complex and cultural marketing analysis in these terms, Quality Function Deployment was used. This ground was tested in the SC strategic planning process in the SCs of Korolev and Fryazino, Moscow Region, Russia. It was shown that the CA helps to speed up the traditional strategic planning significantly.","[Raikov, Alexander N.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Control Sci, Profsoyuznaya St 65, Moscow 117997, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; V.A.

Meanwhile, whistleblower testimony about how social media inadvertently engineers self-harm in young people and how there is more than a suggestion that our collective big data is being used in social engineering experiments at scale reinforces a growing vocal concern with ethics in professional UX circles. The chasm into which all of this simultaneously falls into and erupts from is human factors-that traditional add on to technology development that is firmly in the gap between analog and automation; between people and machine; between user and design, affordance, and agency. All of these issues are thus digital transformation issues.

Visual analytics plays a critical role in effectively navigating humans through twin data, enabling them to make better decisions and discover new knowledge, contributing to the evolution of digital twins. However, due to the lack of study of visual analytics components and their inter-relations in the context of the digital twin, the visual analytic process of digital twin systems lacks guidance to fully integrate human domain experience and cognitive abilities into the intelligent decision-making process of digital twin systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a conceptual visual analytics framework for digital twins (DTVA). Moreover, from the perspective of data and models in digital twins, the works concerning key factors of visual analytics, including digital-twin visual representation (DTV), analytical reasoning (DTA), and human-machine interface (DTI), are analyzed from data flow, task flow, and visual flow. At last, a case study of DTVA-based anomaly detection, which focuses on the abnormality detection of crane operation status, is presented. This work can support digital twin visual analytics, put forward ideas for the direction of visual analytics, and provide a promising direction for digital twin visualization services.","[Zheng, Hangbin; Liu, Jiayu; Bao, Jinsong] Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tianyuan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China",Donghua University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Bao, JS (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Mech Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",zhb@mail.dhu.edu.cn; tianyuan.liu@polyu.edu.hk; liujiayu199804@163.com; bao@dhu.edu.cn,"Liu, Jiayu/JCO-5073-2023; LIU, Tianyuan/ITV-8891-2023","BAO, Jinsong/0000-0003-1999-1003; LIU, Tianyuan/0000-0002-4563-8716",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB1706300],National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China),AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the funding support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2019YFB1706300).,,44,4,4,27,109,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0956-5515,1572-8145,,J INTELL MANUF,J.

Player modeling refers to descriptions of players based on frameworks of data derived from the interaction of a player's behavior within the game as well as the player's experience with the game. Player behavior focuses on dynamic and static information gathered at the time of gameplay. Player experience concerns the association of the human player during gameplay, which is based on cognitive and affective physiological measurements collected from sensors mounted on the player's body or in the player's surroundings. In this paper, player experience modeling is studied based on the board puzzle game Candy Crush Saga using cognitive data of players accessed by physiological and peripheral devices. Long Short-Term Memory-based Deep Neural Network (LSTM-DNN) is used to predict players' effective states in terms of valence, arousal, dominance, and liking by employing the concept of transfer learning. Transfer learning focuses on gaining knowledge while solving one problem and using the same knowledge to solve different but related problems. The homogeneous transfer learning approach has not been implemented in the game domain before, and this novel study opens a new research area for the game industry where the main challenge is predicting the significance of innovative games for entertainment and players' engagement. Relevant not only from a player's point of view, it is also a benchmark study for game developers who have been facing problems of cold start for innovative games that strengthen the game industrial economy.","[Farooq, Sehar Shahzad; Fiaz, Mustansar; Jung, Soon Ki] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Daegu, South Korea; [Mehmood, Irfan] Univ Bradford, Sch Media Design & Technol, Fac Engn & Informat, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Bashir, Ali Kashif] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp & Math, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Nawaz, Raheel] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Operat Technol Events & Hospitality Manageme, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kim, KyungJoong] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Integrated Technol, Gwangju, South Korea",Kyungpook National University (KNU); University of Bradford; Manchester Metropolitan University; Manchester Metropolitan University; Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST),"Jung, SK (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Daegu, South Korea.",skjung@knu.ac.kr,"Nawaz, Raheel/AAX-5293-2021; Jung, Soon/P-7687-2018; Bashir, Ali Kashif/R-4015-2019","Kim, Kyung Joong/0000-0002-7732-0817; Jung, Soon Ki/0000-0003-0239-6785; Fiaz, Mustansar/0000-0003-2289-2284; Nawaz, Raheel/0000-0001-9588-0052","BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) - Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea [4199990214394]; Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea Government (MSIT) [2017-0-00053]","BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) - Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea Government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)","This study was supported by the BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) funded by the Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea (4199990214394).

Human errors are classified and identified at a coarse-grained task level in the TRACEr framework, which could cause failures to completely identify and analyze the human errors in a given accident. This motivated us to propose an adapted TRACEr to overcome the limitation. The adapted TRACEr incorporates hierarchical task analysis (HTA) to decompose a task into combinations of activities, which helps describe human errors at a fine-grained activity level. The connection between the added activity level and the cognitive functions was constructed according to the Phoenix method. Based on the adaptation, an activity-oriented structure of human error taxonomies was developed, and a corresponding retrospective analysis procedure that focuses on identifying errors under various construction operational situations was proposed. Based on the adapted TRACEr, SMO errors were identified and analyzed. The error taxonomies of SMO were developed, and 72 accidents were retrospectively analyzed to identify and code the errors. Data mining techniques were applied to analyze the fine-grained SMO error data to reveal the main manifestations of SMO errors and the hidden associated rules for their cognitive failures. Consequently, several targeted cognitive-based human error mitigation strategies were proposed, showing the application potential of the adapted TRACEr as a human error management tool in the construction industry.","[Li, Jue; Xie, Yong; Zeng, Wei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Dept Syst Sci & Engn, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongwei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Dept Prod & Operat Management & Logist Management, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Li, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Dept Syst Sci & Engn, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",lijue@hust.edu.cn; hwwang@hust.edu.cn; xyhust@163.com; zengwei@mail.hust.edu.cn,"Li, Jue/GWV-4709-2022; , wang/G-3843-2013",", wang/0000-0002-6206-7353; Li, Jue/0000-0001-8195-8365","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71390524, 71821001, 71871100]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71390524, 71821001, and 71871100).",,58,3,3,6,80,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9364,1943-7862,,J CONSTR ENG M,J.

Dynamic concept learning is an approach that can effectively process the acquired massive data and extract valuable information from them. Concept cognitive learning (CCL) is a very active research direction in the field of dynamic concept learning, while partial order formal structure analysis (POFSA) is a concrete and practical model of CCL. However, the existing CCL algorithms in POFSA face some challenges when processing constantly changing data. Therefore, this paper is devoted to explore an incremental CCL algorithm based on three-way object partial order structure diagram (OPOSD) in POFSA with the incorporation of the thoughts of incremental learning. The features of five object categories are considered, and their incremental influences on three-way OPOSD are analyzed and their incremental CCL algorithms in three-way OPOSD are established. Based on some real famous formal contexts, this paper conducts numerical experiments, and the results show that the incremental CCL algorithm based on three-way OPOSD is consistent with human cognitive principles, and can improve the CCL performance of POFSA as well.

In industrial settings, the current methods for constructing a human digital twin model rely on motion capture devices that require personnel to wear cumbersome equipment, which goes against the principle of flexible interaction advocated for HRC. Furthermore, the current methods do not model humans and robots in a unified space, which is both unintuitive and inconvenient for perceiving and understanding the overall environment. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a digital twin system for HRC. This system facilitates the construction of a digital twin scene, the mapping from the real space to the virtual space, and the planning and execution of collaborative strategies from the virtual to the real space. Designed explicitly for common workstation settings, a robust human mesh recovery algorithm is introduced to address the challenge of reconstructing occluded human bodies. Additionally, uncertainty estimation is employed to enhance the action recognition algorithm, ensuring a controllable level of risk in the recognition process. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over baseline methods. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the HRC system are validated through a case study involving component assembly.","[Zhang, Zequn; Ji, Yuchen; Tang, Dunbing; Chen, Jie; Liu, Changchun] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Ji, YC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",jiyuchen@nuaa.edu.cn,"Ji, Yuchen/HTQ-1864-2023","Zhang, Zequn/0000-0001-7597-0894","National Natural Science Foundation of China [92267109, 52305539]; China Postdoctoral Sci-ence Foundation [2023M731661]; Jiangsu Provincial Post-doctoral Excellence Program [2022ZB213]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Sci-ence Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Jiangsu Provincial Post-doctoral Excellence Program,"This is a part of research supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (92267109, 52305539) , China Postdoctoral Sci-ence Foundation (2023M731661) and the Jiangsu Provincial Post-doctoral Excellence Program (2022ZB213) .",,62,15,15,23,77,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

Since reverse engineers rely heavily on visual information, eye tracking holds promise for studying their cognitive processes. To gain further insights, we additionally employ verbal thought protocols during and immediately after HRE tasks: Concurrent and Retrospective Think Aloud. We evaluate the combination of eye tracking and Think Aloud with 41 participants in an HRE simulation. Eye tracking accurately identifies fixations on individual circuit elements and highlights critical components. Based on two use cases, we demonstrate that eye tracking and Think Aloud can complement each other to improve data quality.

We present such a semantic foundation. This framework extends beyond previous approaches by extending the agent-local dynamic state beyond state components under direct control of the agent and belief about other agents (as previously suggested for understanding cooperative as well as rational behavior) to agent-local evidence and belief about the overall cooperative, competitive, or coopetitive game structure. We argue that this extension is necessary for rigorously analyzing systems of human cyber-physical systems because humans are known to employ cognitive replacement models of system dynamics that are both non-stationary and potentially incongruent. These replacement models induce visible and potentially harmful effects on their joint emergent behavior and the interaction with cyber-physical system components.","[Damm, Werner; Fraenzle, Martin; Hagemann, Willem; Held, Moritz; Lehnhoff, Sebastian; Rakow, Astrid; Rieger, Jochem; Sonntag, Daniel; Schwammberger, Maike; Schweda, Mark; Unni, Anirudh] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlaender Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Kerscher, Alyssa J.; Laine, Forrest] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Hess, David] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Sociol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Sztipanovits, Janos] Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Software Integrated Syst, PMB 351829, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Bengler, Klaus; Biebl, Bianca] Tech Univ Muenchen, Boltzmannstr 15, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Kacianka, Severin; Pretschner, Alexander] Tech Univ Muenchen, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching 3, Germany; [Ihme, Klas] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Transportat Syst, Lilienthalpl 7, D-38108 Braunschweig, Germany; [Luedtke, Andreas; Trende, Alexander] DLR Inst Syst Engn Zukuenftige Mobilitaet SE, Escherweg 2, D-26121 Oldenburg, Germany; [Sonntag, Daniel] Deutsch Forschungszentrum Kuenstl Intelligenz Gmb, Interakt Maschinelles Lernen, Marie Curie Str 1, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Veith, Eric] OFFIS eV, Escherweg 2, D-26121 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Damm, W (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlaender Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",werner.damm@uni-oldenburg.de; martin.fraenzle@uni-oldenburg.de; alyssaj.kerscher@vanderbilt.edu; forrest.laine@vanderbilt.edu; bengler@tuni.de; bianca.biebl@tum.de; willem.hagemann@uni-oldetiburg.de; moritz.held@uni-oldenburg.de; david.j.hess@Vanderbilt.Edu; klas.ihme@dlr.de; severin.kacianka@in.tum.de; sebastian.lehnhoff@uni-oldenburg.de; andreas.luedtke@d1r.de; alexander.pretschner@tum.de; a.rakow@uni-oldenburg.de; jochem.rieger@uni-oldenburg.de; daniel.sonnlag@uni-oldenburg.de; janos.sztipanovits@vanderbilt.edu; m.schwanimberger@uni-oldenburg.de; mark.schweda@uni-oldenburg.de; alexander.trende@dlr.de; anirudh.unni@uni-oldenburg.de; eric.veith@offis.de,"Hess, David/K-1780-2017","Franzle, Martin/0000-0002-9138-8340; Hess, David/0000-0001-8117-0260; Biebl, Bianca/0000-0002-1611-7348; Held, Moritz/0000-0002-6236-7946; Laine, Forrest/0000-0003-3982-3920; Sztipanovits, Janos/0000-0002-8360-6299; Hagemann, Willem/0000-0002-8259-6084; Schwammberger, Maike/0000-0002-3344-6282; Damm, Werner/0000-0002-7277-1803; Ihme, Klas/0000-0002-7911-3512","United States National Science Foundation Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) PIRE program; Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) CPS program [OISE-1743772]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [433524510, 433524788, 433524434]",United States National Science Foundation Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) PIRE program; Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) CPS program; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work is supported, in part, by the United States National Science Foundation Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) PIRE program and the Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) CPS program under grant OISE-1743772, and in part by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grants for projects Assuring Individual, Social, and Cultural Embeddedness of Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems, project numbers 433524510, 433524788, and 433524434.",,20,0,0,1,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",2378-962X,2378-9638,,ACM TRANS CYBER-PHYS,ACM Trans.

However, evaluation and control of shape features are done in trial and error based on the experience and intuition of the designer, causing the inefficiency of styling design. Therefore, this study aims to support the styling design by quantifying cognitive characteristics in curved surface shape. First, this research proposed total absolute curvature to quantify complexity, which is one of the shape features related to beauty, and described its geometric meaning as the total area of the Gauss map on the curved surface shape. Next, the tangible calculation method is shown by applying it to the curved surface shape represented by a triangular polygon mesh. Then, sensory evaluation experiments were carried out using three types of shapes generated by extrusion, rotation, and emergent shape generation system to confirm the applicability of the proposed quantification method. Finally, the result revealed that the logarithmic approximation between the proposed index and human perceived complexity.

In this context, main aim is help people with severe disabilities restore the movement ability, or replace lost motor function controlling external devices, or communicate with other people leading them to become more self-sufficient. The connection between BCI and wireless communication standards brings BCI into the Internet of Things (IoT), giving the opportunity to better interconnect the brain of both able and disable people with the surrounding physical and cyber worlds: it is called the human in the loop paradigm. The combination of BCI and IoT falls within the wider topic of Cognitive IoT technology, an enriched solution for Industry 4.0 and IoT in industry. The integration of the human role in the IoT can lead to several advantages both in human life and in technological progress. As a novel measurement device, BCI has to be widely characterized in order to improve the reliability of the obtained result. In this work, the authors review the scientific challenges of electroencephalography data acquisition for BCI, the parameters influencing its variability, and the processing techniques for a correct feature extraction and data classification. In particular, first the influence factors and the issues of EEG acquisition are reviewed. Then, the most popular devices used for BCI sensing unit are described.

The rapid development of semiconductors demands an imperative acceleration of training and the development of a highly skilled workforce. There is a gap between the knowledge and skills of students in the current education system and the fast development of new knowledge. To accelerate comprehensive training in the semiconductor workforce we must start at an early stage, this paper proposes that STEM education must be pedagogically grounded in the advances of cognitive neuroscience and learning. By understanding how the brain functions and how it learns, the process can be enhanced, the education of an Integral Engineer needs to be addressed by forming professionals equipped with adaptability, complex problem-solving, assertive communication, emotional intelligence, interdisciplinary teamwork skills, systems, analytical and critical thinking.

It outperformed human muscle power by orders of magnitude. Nobody imagined that this single invention would evocate massive consequences: The steam engine increased industrial production, led to societal upheaval, and changed the political landscape for the next 100 years. There had been no historical parallel on the effect of a dedicated technical invention on humankind in such a short timefiume. At the beginning of the 21st century, we might experience a similar dynamic. This time, artificial intelligence spread the word of a new era that makes cognitive capabilities available on a large scale. Machines with highly sophisticated mental competencies will turn upside down the knowledge work in every company department, be it marketing, human resources, research and development, customer service, or the even the board of directors. Moreover, this time, intelligent machines will outperform human brain power. This paper argues that the arrival of artificial intelligence at the enterprise pave the way to a wicked problem: It cannot be resolved by tested methodologies, given procedures, and best practices. Instead, it requires a more sophisticated approach: First, companies must involve all relevant stakeholders at the initial stage of deployment because the impact of artificial intelligence is far-reaching. Second, companies must question their given value system because it closely resonates with the capabilities of artificial intelligence machines. Third, companies must conduct controlled experiments, because divide and rule do not work anymore to handle machines that mimic humanthinking. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This paper uses the exemplar of wear classification in thermal spraying to outline how relevant cognitive processes can be elicited and combined with technical variables in a singular, efficient and cognitively plausible modelling framework. To this end, eye tracking and high-resolution voltage measurements were performed in a pilot study, and a representative data set was generated for small data problems. Two multidimensional fuzzy pattern classification models were derived. Results show that both human and technical models are significant and complement one another. While the models still require optimizing, they clearly show that the integrative approach is practicable and fruitful.

In this paper, we propose a 3D game, Multitask In Neurofeedback Driving (MIND) for training and testing of the multitasking ability. The game is developed using the Unreal 3 game engine and incorporates neurofeedback, a technique used in the training of human cognitive abilities, to further enhance the potential benefits of the training procedure. The tasks used in the multitasking condition are inspired by various psychological tests and implemented in a manner that attempts to simulate the general cognitive processes required for multitasking while driving a vehicle or piloting an aircraft.

Existing reliability approaches qualify human behaviors in a static manner. In this contribution dynamically changing situations are considered: as example dynamic and situated driving context is used for human reliability evaluation. The dynamic and situated driving context requires dynamic solutions for human reliability evaluation. Cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) provides the evaluation method for human reliability in industrial fields, when it is applied to situated context, adaption is required. Human-related accidents account for the highest proportion of total accidents. Human experience as an important factor for driving safety so should be considered when human driver reliability is evaluated. In this contribution, human driver experience (HDE) is quantitatively characterized for the first time. Three variables are selected to evaluate HDE in situated driving context. A new list of common performance conditions (CPCs) in CREAM to characterize the situated driving context is generated due to the application limits of CPCs in original CREAM. To determine the levels in HDE variables and new generated CPCs, fuzzy neighborhood density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (FN-DBSCAN) is applied to driving data defining the membership function parameters. Therefore, HDE and human driver reliability score (HDRS) in situated driving context are calculated quantitatively. In this contribution evaluation of HDE and HDRS is data-driven and the reliance on expert knowledge is reduced. Next, a new evaluation index, human performance reliability score (HPRS) is defined. The results show that the method could quantify and evaluate human driver reliability in real time.","[He, Chao; Soeffker, Dirk] Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Dynam & Control, Lotharstr 1-21, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"He, C (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Dynam & Control, Lotharstr 1-21, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",chao.he@uni-due.de; soeffker@uni-due.de,"Söffker, Dirk/J-5763-2015",,China Council scholarship,China Council scholarship(China Scholarship Council),The first author was awarded a China Council scholarship to pursue his Ph.D. at the Chair of Dynamics in Germany.,,20,1,1,4,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-0170-8,,,,2021,,,,,,,71,76,,10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582451,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582451,,,6,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Ergonomics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering,BU0XY,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000873141600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, their impact on combined physical and cognitive aspects of industrial work performance remains inadequately understood, especially regarding potential differences between exoskeleton categories. A randomized, counterbalanced cross-over study was conducted, comparing the active CrayX, passive Paexo Back, and a no exoskeleton condition. A 15-min dual task was used to simulate both cognitive and physical aspects of industrial work performance. Cognitive workload parameters included reaction time, accuracy, and subjective measures. Physical workload included movement duration, segmented in three phases: (1) walking to and grabbing the box, (2) picking up, carrying, and putting down the box, and (3) returning to the starting point. Comfort of both devices was also surveyed. The Paexo significantly increased movement duration in the first segment compared to NoExo (Paexo = 1.55 +/- 0.19 s; NoExo = 1.32 +/- 0.17 s; p < .01). Moreover, both the Paexo and CrayX increased movement duration for the third segment compared to NoExo (CrayX = 1.70 +/- 0.27 s; Paexo = 1.74 +/- 0.27 s, NoExo = 1.54 +/- 0.23 s; p < .01). No significant impact on cognitive outcomes was observed. Movement Time 2 was not significantly affected by both exoskeletons. Results of the first movement segment suggest the Paexo may hinder trunk bending, favoring the active device for dynamic movements. Both devices may have contributed to a higher workload as the movement duration in the third segment increased compared to NoExo.","[Govaerts, Renee; Turcksin, Tom; Vanderborght, Bram; Roelands, Bart; Meeusen, Romain; De Pauw, Kevin; De Bock, Sander] Vrije Univ Brussel, BruBot, Brussels, Belgium; [Govaerts, Renee; Roelands, Bart; Meeusen, Romain; De Pauw, Kevin; De Bock, Sander] Vrije Univ Brussel, Human Physiol & Sports Physiotherapy Res Grp, Brussels, Belgium; [Turcksin, Tom] Flanders Make AugmentX, Brussels, Belgium; [Vanderborght, Bram] Vrije Univ Brussel, Robot & Multibody Mech Res Grp, Brussels, Belgium; [Vanderborght, Bram] IMEC, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre,"De Pauw, K (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, BruBot, Brussels, Belgium.;De Pauw, K (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Human Physiol & Sports Physiotherapy Res Grp, Brussels, Belgium.",Kevin.De.Pauw@vub.be,"Roelands, Bart/E-2337-2011; De Bock, Sander/AAX-8336-2020; De Pauw, Kevin/E-8937-2018","De Pauw, Kevin/0000-0002-6901-7199; De Bock, Sander/0000-0001-8351-9702; Govaerts, Renee/0000-0003-0274-6204",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program SOPHIA [871237]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [871237] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program SOPHIA; H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership),This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program SOPHIA under Grant Agreement No. 871237.,,47,1,1,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",,2631-7176,,WEAR TECHNOL,Wearable Technol.,DEC 20,2023,4,,,,,,,,e27,10.1017/wtc.2023.25,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wtc.2023.25,,,16,"Engineering, Biomedical; Robotics; Rehabilitation",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Robotics; Rehabilitation,MJ7N6,38487761,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-15,WOS:001193320500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These tasks, such as entity resolution, sentiment analysis, and image recognition can be enhanced through the use of human cognitive ability. Crowdsouring platforms are an effective way to harness the capabilities of people (i.e., the crowd) to apply human computation for such tasks. Thus, crowdsourced data management has become an area of increasing interest in research and industry. We identify three important problems in crowdsourced data management. (1) Quality Control: Workers may return noisy or incorrect results so effective techniques are required to achieve high quality; (2) Cost Control: The crowd is not free, and cost control aims to reduce the monetary cost; (3) Latency Control: The human workers can be slow, particularly compared to automated computing time scales, so latency-control techniques are required. There has been significant work addressing these three factors for designing crowdsourced tasks, developing crowdsourced data manipulation operators, and optimizing plans consisting of multiple operators. In this paper, we survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on crowdsourced data management.

Undetected errors can result in large financial and environmental costs to packaging companies and supermarkets but the contributors to such error are underexplored. The research reported in this paper investigated human error in the quality control checking of information displayed on the labels which accompany packaged fresh produce. Initial work sought to understand the demands of label-checking in the packhouse environment, through interviews with key quality control staff, in situ observations, and the study of historical error data held by a fresh produce packaging company. This study highlighted the dynamic and cognitively challenging environment in which label-checking occurred, while the historical error data indicated both the scale of the packhouse's work and the infrequency of error occurring. In a separate strand of laboratory-based research, experienced and novice label-checkers were presented with a simulated label-checking task and a battery of computerized and pen-and-paper tests. These tasks were administered to determine whether cognitive abilities could predict label-checking accuracy in a controlled laboratory environment. Stronger abilities in two cognitive processes (information processing speed and inhibition) predicted greater overall accuracy and higher detection of labeling errors. In identifying potential contributors to human error in the quality control checking of product labels both in situ and in the laboratory, the results are relevant to manufacturing, wherever information is printed on labels, especially when labeling processes depend upon human data entry and human quality control checking.","[Smith-Spark, James H.; Katz, Hillary B.; Marchant, Alexander P.] London South Bank Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Div Psychol, 103 Borough Rd, London SE1 0AA, England; [Wilcockson, Thomas D.

Our objective is to harness individual tacit knowledge from senior directors about human factors as it relates to strategic goals and to make explicit their shared managerial thinking with an aim to identifying improvement opportunities using HF. Individual cognitive maps were drawn during one-hour interviews with seven senior directors of a large electronics firm. The maps were then merged on a common strategic goal of 'improving quality' into a group map containing 221 concepts and 900 loops. In a two hour workshop with the directors, reducing fatigue, improving systems design, and reducing repetitive activities were concepts that emerged as critical-to-quality. Workshop discussions identified untapped improvement opportunities. Directors viewed the maps as a dynamic indicator of their HF performance. Making the connection between HF and strategic goals explicit can help an organisation identify opportunities to improve human, and therefore business, performance.","[Village, Judy; Salustri, Filippo A.; Neumann, W.

This paradigm opens up novel applications where a the cognitive capability of a user is combined with the precision and strength of robots. Yet, current pHRI interfaces suffer from low take-up and a high cognitive burden for the user. We propose a novel framework that robustly and efficiently assists users by reacting proactively to their commands. The key insight is to include context- and user-awareness in the controller, improving decision-making on how to assist the user. Context-awareness is achieved by inferring the candidate objects to be grasped in a task or scene and automatically computing plans for reaching them. User-awareness is implemented by facilitating the motion toward the most likely object that the user wants to grasp, as well as dynamically recovering from incorrect predictions. Experimental results in a virtual environment of two degrees of freedom control show the capability of this approach to outperform manual control. By robustly predicting user intention, the proposed controller allows subjects to achieve superhuman performance in terms of accuracy and, thereby, usability.","[Veselic, Sebastijan] UCL, Dept Clin & Movement Neurosci, London, England; [Veselic, Sebastijan] UCL, Wellcome Ctr Human Neuroimaging, London, England; [Veselic, Sebastijan; Zito, Claudio] Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Zito, Claudio] Technol Innovat Inst, Autonomous Robot Res Ctr, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Farina, Dario] Imperial Coll London, Dept Bioengn, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; University of Birmingham; Technology Innovation Institute; Imperial College London,"Zito, C (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Zito, C (corresponding author), Technol Innovat Inst, Autonomous Robot Res Ctr, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",claudio.zito@tii.ae,,,European Research Council Synergy Project Natural BionicS [810346],European Research Council Synergy Project Natural BionicS(European Research Council (ERC)),This study was supported by the European Research Council Synergy Project Natural BionicS (contract #810346 to DF).

To this purpose, the second-generation HRA methods consider contextual and cognitive factors -named Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) -that may influence the workers' performance during tasks execution. Despite the recent extension of HRA methods to different fields, only few studies refer to the manufacturing sector. In addition, the majority of contributions assume the independence among PSFs, which may result in an over or under estimation of HEP. Therefore, the present paper focuses on the manufacturing sector to propose a Fuzzy DEMATEL (FDEMATEL) based method to support the risk analyst in the quantification of PSF interrelationships and importance, when computing HEP.As a result, the most influential human factors on which taking priority actions to improve the overall human reliability may be identified accurately. Based on a selected list of PSFs, the methodological approach is implemented in an Italian textile company, where experience and training factors are demonstrated to be the most central ones to increase the human reliability when performing the weaving process tasks. The designed approach is well structured and effortless as well as it allows at considering the uncertainty and vagueness of input data and a group decision context.","[La Fata, C.

They have also paved way for the use of assistive robots to accurately assess human cognitive and physical skills. Assessment and training cannot be generalized as the requirement varies for every person and for every application. The ability of the system to adapt to the individual's needs and performance is essential for its effectiveness. In this paper, the focus is on task performance prediction which is an important parameter to consider for personalization. Several research works focus on how to predict task performance based on physiological and behavioral data. In this work, we follow a multi-modal approach where the system collects information from different modalities to predict performance based on (a) User's emotional state recognized from facial expressions(Behavioral data), (b) User's emotional state from body postures(Behavioral data) (c) task performance from EEG signals (Physiological data) while the person performs a robot-based cognitive task. This multi-modal approach of combining physiological data and behavioral data produces the highest accuracy of 87.5 percent, which outperforms the accuracy of prediction extracted from any single modality. In particular, this approach is useful in finding associations between facial expressions, body postures and brain signals while a person performs a cognitive task.","[Babu, Ashwin Ramesh; Rajavenkatanarayanan, Akilesh; Brady, James Robert; Makedon, Fillia] Univ Texas Arlington, Heracleia Lab, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Babu, AR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Heracleia Lab, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",ashwin.rameshbabu@mavs.uta.edu; akilesh.rajavenkatanarayanan@mavs.uta.edu; james.brady2@mavs.uta.edu; makedon@uta.edu,"Rajavenkatanarayanan, Akilesh/T-8291-2019; Ramesh Babu, Ashwin/AHB-4406-2022",,,,,,50,0,0,0,9,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-6072-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,10.1145/3279810.3279849,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3279810.3279849,,,7,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS1NR,,Bronze,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000693651700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Engineers have been tasked with progressively automating functions previously completed manually. Industry continues promoting a mechanized workforce in order to minimise business variations in human performance and maximise their productivity. Researchers also continue to pursue this goal using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computational Intelligence (CI) and Machine Intelligence (MI) techniques. This process of transforming cognitive functionality into machine actionable form has encountered bottlenecks, such as scalability and inconsistent performance. More recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been employed to provide a flexible framework for research and development, because of their ability to easily embody system complexity. The proposed framework should facilitate the development of components, their interoperability, coordination and cooperation techniques needed to solve complex, real-world problems within a dangerous and/or dynamic environment. Based on the effort to seek or facilitate human-like decision making within machines, the lack of success indicates that further research is required. This chapter discusses one possible avenue. It involves future research, aimed at achieving a cognitive sub-system for use on-board platforms. The framework introduced in this chapter is aimed at embedding traditional heuristic knowledge and higher order cognitive computation techniques. This conceptual mechanism could ultimately be used to implement a virtual mind when technology facilitates a real-time implementation and could be used to progressively enhance automation, achieve greater independence and enable more autonomous behaviour within control systems.","[Tweedale, Jeffrey W.] Def Sci & Technol Org, Edinburgh, SA 5111, Australia; [Tweedale, Jeffrey W.] Univ S Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia",Defence Science & Technology; University of South Australia,"Tweedale, JW (corresponding author), Def Sci & Technol Org, Edinburgh, SA 5111, Australia.",Jeffrey.Tweedale@dsto.defence.gov.au,"TWEEDALE, Jeffrey/D-3022-2011",,,,,,82,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2190-3018,,978-3-319-13545-8; 978-3-319-13544-1,SMART INNOV SYST TEC,,,2015,30,,,,,,251,276,,10.1007/978-3-319-13545-8_15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-13545-8_15,10.1007/978-3-319-13545-8,,26,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Computer Science,BD0RK,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000357603000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

DOLCE clearly lists the ontological choices it is based upon, relies on philosophical principles, is richly formalized, and is built according to well-established ontological methodologies, e.g. OntoClean. Because of these features, it has inspired most of the existing top-level ontologies and has been used to develop or improve standards and public domain resources (e.g. CIDOC CRM, DBpedia and WordNet). Being a foundational ontology, DOLCE is not directly concerned with domain knowledge. Its purpose is to provide the general categories and relations needed to give a coherent view of reality, to integrate domain knowledge, and to mediate across domains. In these 20 years DOLCE has shown that applied ontologies can be stable and that interoperability across reference and domain ontologies is a reality.

The result was the creation of an Express Document, CSA EXP248 Pipeline Human Factors. CSA EXP248 (EXP248) considers Human Factors through the life cycle of a pipeline asset. The main goal of this document is to improve pipeline safety performance through management of risks associated with Human Factors. It provides guidance to pipeline operators on the need and means to integrate Human Factors in all aspects of the Pipeline Life Cycle and Management System, with philosophy considerations for integration of Human Factors into a fit for service pipeline system. A review of EXP248 will illustrate how this document provides information that is scalable to organizations based on size and complexity. This paper reviews the new CSA Group Express Document process and its application for the Pipeline Industry. This paper will discuss kkey aspects of EXP248 that operators could apply and practical tips on the application of this guidance to the pipeline operating community. Areas highlighted during this review include elements of a Human Factors program, consideration of physical, organizational and cognitive demands of a job or task, and integration of Human Factors into Management Systems.

At the same time, the KIM is performed by two ergonomics experts to validate the results of the MoCap system and to check the suitability of the system for ergonomic analysis.","[Feldmann, Felix; ten Hompel, Michael] TU Dortmund, Chair Mat Handling & Warehousing, Dortmund, Germany; [Seitz, Robin; Kretschmer, Veronika; Bednorz, Nicole] Fraunhofer Inst Mat Flow & Logist IML, Intralogist & IT Planning, Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Feldmann, F (corresponding author), TU Dortmund, Chair Mat Handling & Warehousing, Dortmund, Germany.",felix2.feldmann@tu-dortmund.de; rseitz@iml.fraunhofer.de; vkretschmer@iml.fraunhofer.de; nbednorz@iml.fraunhofer.de; michael.tenhompel@tu-dortmund.de,"ten Hompel, Michael/IXW-9575-2023",,,,,,16,5,6,1,31,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2166-5656,,978-1-7281-0329-7,PROGNOST SYST HEALT,,,2019,,,,,,,204,209,,10.1109/PHM-Paris.2019.00041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PHM-Paris.2019.00041,,,6,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BN6BA,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000485048900034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, to assess the risks of those systems, not only the reliability of the technological components has to be accounted for, but also the 'human model'. For this reason, engineers have been working together with psychologists and sociologists to understand cognitive functions and how the organisational context influences individual actions. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) identifies and analyses the causes, consequences and contributions of human performance (including failures) in complex sociotechnical systems. Generally, HRA research is concentrated in modelling workers' performance in the sharp-end, assessing the ones directly involved in handling the system, especially operators. However, in theory, a reliability analysis can be applied to any kind of human action, including those from designers and managers. This research will evaluate a way of conducting HRA in the design process, as previous research has demonstrated that design failure is the predominant contributor to human errors (Moura et al., 2016). Bayesian Network (BN) - a systematic way of learning from experience and incorporating new evidence (deterministic or probabilistic) - is proposed to model the complex relationships within cognitive functions, organisational and technological factors. Conditional probability tables have been obtained from a dataset of major accidents from different industry sectors (Moura et al. 2017), using a classification scheme developed by Hollnagel (1998) for an HRA method called CREAM - Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method. The model allows to infer which factors most influence human performance in different scenarios. Also, we will discuss if the model can be applied to any human actions through the project life cycle-since the design phase to the operational phase, including their management.","[Morais, C.; Moura, R.; Beer, M.; Patelli, E.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Morais, C.; Moura, R.] Natl Agcy Petr Nat Gas & Biofuels ANP, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Beer, M.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Risk & Reliabil, Hannover, Germany; [Beer, M.] Tongji Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Beer, M.] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Inst Disaster Prevent & Relief, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Liverpool; Leibniz University Hannover; Tongji University; Tongji University,"Morais, C (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;Morais, C (corresponding author), Natl Agcy Petr Nat Gas & Biofuels ANP, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,"Beer, Michael/G-2050-2015; Patelli, Edoardo/B-1364-2010","Patelli, Edoardo/0000-0002-5007-7247; Beer, Michael/0000-0002-0611-0345",,,,,26,5,5,0,0,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN, South Holland, NETHERLANDS",,,978-1-351-17466-4; 978-0-8153-8682-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,329,338,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BP3XK,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000549917600041,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study evaluates animation variations within videos to direct trainee attention towards hazards. Three degrees of animations were compared: (1) static images: regular fixed pictures, (2) partially animated images: cinemagraphs, and (3) fully animated images: traditional videos. A case study was employed to understand the perspective of construction domain experts that trained using the different animation approaches to recognize a select set of struck-by hazards. A between-subjects experimental design was used to collect measures regarding hazard identification index (HII), attitudes, cognitive absorption, and transportability from 19 study participants. The results of this investigation did not detect statistical differences in the average hazard identification index scores using narrated static images ( average = 69.1%; STD = 27.9%), cinemagraphs (average = 80.5%; STD = 16.4%), or videos ( average = 66.7%; STD = 10.5%).

Adoption of this concept has placed a significant demand on Construction 4.0 skills, as the industry is undergoing a transformation that calls for new strategies and specialized skill sets. While Construction 4.0 promises significant productivity gains, its widespread adoption often overlooks the crucial role of specialized skills, leading to a mismatch in expected outcomes. The oftenunderexplored theoretical dimensions of Construction 4.0 skills has the potential to bridge the gap between these skills and formulation of productivity goals and achieving them, highlighting the profound importance of understanding and integrating these skills in the context of Construction 4.0. While there has been a recent interest in Construction 4.0 skills across various national contexts, the theoretical dimensions of skills within the realm of Construction 4.0 remains unexplored. Therefore, this study examines the definitions, interpretations, and theories of skills within the context of Construction 4.0. Through a conceptual review of existing academic literature and policy documents, this research offers profound understanding of defintions and how the theories of Construction 4.0 intersect with skills development and thus impact the formulation of productivity goals. The definitions of Industry 4.0/Construction 4.0 formulated in various national frameworks are defined in accordance with their geographical, social, and cultural contexts and that have distinct production aims and scopes. The identified theoretical underpinnings of Construction 4.0 include digital building ecosystem, lean construction, circular economy, smart cities, and skills-related theories such as social learning theory, human capital theory, cognitive load theory, situated learning theory, and lifelong learning theory. The examination brings forth novel insights that promise to shape the future of Construction 4.0 skills development. By bridging the gap between theoretical constructs and productivity goals (labour efficiency, process efficiency, time efficiency, waste reduction, energy and water efficiency) within the context of Construction 4.0, this study offers a fresh perspective that integrates technology, sustainability, and collaboration to propel productivity goals. The research also emphasizes the varying prioritization of Construction 4.0 skill sets in different national contexts, and underscores the need for sector-specific frameworks for Construction 4.0 skills. Moreover, potential avenues for future research in the field of Construction 4.0 skills include perspectives of workers, real-world impacts on the industry, policy advancements, skills frameworks, ethical evaluations, and scenario planning.","[Siriwardhana, Senuri] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Moehler, Robert C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastructure Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia",Monash University; University of Melbourne,"Moehler, RC (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastructure Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3053, Australia.",robert.moehler@unimelb.edu.au,"Moehler, Robert/ISS-1545-2023","Moehler, Robert/0000-0003-0003-2478","Monash Graduate Scholarship; Monash International Tuition Scholarship by Monash University, Clayton, Australia","Monash Graduate Scholarship(Monash University); Monash International Tuition Scholarship by Monash University, Clayton, Australia","This work was supported by the Monash Graduate Scholarship and Monash International Tuition Scholarship provided by Monash University, Clayton, Australia.",,157,6,6,23,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

With this aim, the Multi-attribute Technological Accidents Dataset (MATA-D) has been created, using a classification focused on the relation between human errors and their influencing factors (e.g., cognitive functions, organisational and technological factors). The process of collecting new data for this dataset should be constant, not only to decrease epistemic uncertainty in human reliability data but also to reflect changes in human behaviour due to evolving technology and organisational arrangements. However, reading an accident report is a time-consuming process, which delays the learning process. For this reason, this research proposes an automated approach to train the computer on a predefined classification scheme (taxonomy), which will be called the virtual human factors classifier. The virtual classifier should support human experts to analyse accident reports for organisational, technological, and individual factors that may trigger human errors. The proposed approach is based on classifying text according to previously labelled accident reports by human experts. Two case studies are used to demonstrate how data from different sectors can be used to train the machine, providing an efficient cross-discipline knowledge transfer. The accuracy of the results is promising and comparable to the classifications provided by human experts. The proposed work demonstrated to the industry the feasibility of the use of artificial intelligence to collect data and support risk and reliability assessments, and recommendations based on the study findings are suggested for investigation agencies.","[Morais, Caroline; Moura, Raphael; Beer, Michael] Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Chadwick Bldg,Peach St, Liverpool L69 7ZF, Merseyside, England; [Morais, Caroline; Moura, Raphael] Natl Agcy Petr Nat Gas & Biofuels ANP, Av Rio Branco 65, BR-20090004 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Yung, Ka Lai] Univ Toronto, Fac Appl Sci & Engn, 35 St George St,Room 157, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada; [Johnson, Karl; Patelli, Edoardo] Univ Strathclyde, Ctr Intelligent Infrastruct, James Weir Bldg,75 Montrose St, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland; [Beer, Michael] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Risk & Reliabil, Callinstr 34, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Beer, Michael] Tongji Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Liverpool; University of Toronto; University of Strathclyde; Leibniz University Hannover; Tongji University,"Patelli, E (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room 5-05t,James Weir Bldg,75 Montrose St, Glasgow G1 1XJ, Lanark, Scotland.",edoardo.patelli@stratb.ac.uk,"Beer, Michael/G-2050-2015; Patelli, Edoardo/B-1364-2010","Beer, Michael/0000-0002-0611-0345; Patelli, Edoardo/0000-0002-5007-7247; Neves Moura, Raphael/0000-0003-3494-5945","Brazilian Oil & Gas regulator ANP (Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis); EPSRC [EP/R020558/2]; EPSRC [EP/R020558/1, EP/R020558/2] Funding Source: UKRI","Brazilian Oil & Gas regulator ANP (Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Caroline Morais gratefully acknowledges the Brazilian Oil & Gas regulator ANP (Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis) for the support for her research.

The intervention instrument consists of a corpus of human errors and a tool to support human error based software requirements inspections. The primary aim of developing this instrumentation and training material is to impart SE/CS students with the knowledge about the most frequently committed human errors during the software development process. [Goal and Method]: First, a study was conducted with Industry Practitioners with the goal of examining if the practitioners believed that human errors and human error training are useful and relevant to the software development process. Next, based on feedback from the practitioners, a study was conducted in an undergraduate Software Engineering course where students were trained using the human error instrument and were asked to perform error based requirements inspections. The high-level goal of this paper is to evaluate whether requirements inspections supported by human errors can be used to deliver knowledge about software engineering human errors as well as knowledge about requirements inspections (a key industry skill) to students. [Results]: Results showed that industry practitioners found the human error instrumentation and training useful. Based on their feedback, when the training was administered to students, it helped students understand those human errors that are the frequently committed during, the software development process.","[Anu, Vaibhav; Alqudah, Mohammad] Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Walia, Gursimran] North Dakota State Univ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA; [Bradshaw, Gary] Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Montclair State University; North Dakota State University Fargo; Mississippi State University,"Anu, V (corresponding author), Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",anuv@montclair.edu; gursimran.walia@ndsu.edu; glb2@psychology.msstate.edu; alqudahm2@mail.montclair.edu,"Anu, Vaibhav/Y-6008-2019","Anu, Vaibhav/0000-0001-8104-4942",,,,,18,1,1,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0190-5848,,978-1-7281-1746-1,PROC FRONT EDUC CONF,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/fie43999.2019.9028461,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/fie43999.2019.9028461,,,9,"Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Education & Educational Research; Engineering,BP8GE,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000565244800111,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, auditory pre-stimulation has been considered as a means of preventing human errors by improving workers' cognitive task performance. However, most previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the auditory pre-stimulation in a quiet environment. Accordingly, studies on the effects of pre-stimulation in a noisy environment are still lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to empirically investigate: (1) the effects of noisy environments on the performances of cognitive tasks related to different functions of working memory and (2) the effects of auditory pre-stimulation on the performances of cognitive tasks in a field-noise environment. To accomplish these research objectives, two major experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, a total of 24 participants performed each of three basic short-term/working memory (STM/WM) tasks under two different experimental conditions (quiet-noise environment and field-noise environment) depending on the presence or absence of field noise. In the second experiment, the participants performed each of the three basic STM/WM tasks in a field-noise environment after they were provided with one of four different auditory pre-stimulations (quiet noise, white noise, field noise, and mixed (white and field) noise). The three STM/WM tasks were the Corsi block-tapping, Digit span, and 3-back tasks, corresponding to the visuospatial sketchpad, the phonological loop, and the central executive of WM, respectively. The major findings were that: (1) the field-noise environment did not affect the scores of the Corsi block-tapping and 3-back tasks, significantly affecting only the Digit span task score (decreased by 15.2%, p < 0.01); and (2) the Digit span task performance in the field-noise environment was improved by 17.9% (p < 0.05) when mixed noise was provided as a type of auditory pre-stimulation. These findings may be useful for the work-space designs that prevent/minimize human errors and industrial accidents by improving the cognitive task performance of workers in field-noise environments.","[An, Sehee; Kim, Kyeongtae; Ahn, Dohun; Beck, Donghyun] Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Safety Engn, Incheon 22012, South Korea; [Lee, Haehyun] Korea Inst Nucl Safety, Daejeon 34142, South Korea; [Son, Minseok] Samsung Elect Co Ltd, Digital Appliances Business, Seoul 06765, South Korea",Incheon National University; Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS); Samsung Electronics; Samsung,"Beck, D (corresponding author), Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Safety Engn, Incheon 22012, South Korea.;Son, M (corresponding author), Samsung Elect Co Ltd, Digital Appliances Business, Seoul 06765, South Korea.",sehiie@inu.ac.kr; kkt8479@naver.com; chichichi96@naver.com; haehyun_lee@naver.com; head0208@nate.com; bdhmaya@inu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Haehyun/0000-0003-4820-6924; Ahn, Dohun/0000-0002-4065-4995; Son, Minseok/0000-0003-1871-1102; Beck, Donghyun/0000-0003-1872-8262; kim, kyeongtae/0000-0003-3504-4495",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2020R1G1A1013889]; Nuclear Safety Research Program through the Korea Foundation of Nuclear Safety (KoFONS) - Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) of the Republic of Korea [2106005],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Nuclear Safety Research Program through the Korea Foundation of Nuclear Safety (KoFONS) - Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) of the Republic of Korea(Nuclear Safety & Security Commission (NSSC), Republic of KoreaKorea Foundation of Nuclear Safety (KoFONS))",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2020R1G1A1013889) and Nuclear Safety Research Program through the Korea Foundation of Nuclear Safety (KoFONS) using the financial resource granted by the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) of the Republic of Korea (No. 2106005).,,86,0,0,3,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

This large volume of information will make it even more difficult for the human resources within the factory to sift through the large amount of information required since there is a limit to the information that our brains can cope with. Just in time information retrieval (JITIR) within the digital factory environment aims to provide support to the human stakeholders in the system by proactively yet non-intrusively providing the required information at the right time based on the users context. This paper will therefore provide an insight into the cognitive difficulties experienced by humans in the digital factory and how JITIR can tackle these challenges. By validating the JITIR concept, several industry scenarios have been evaluated: an exemplary model, concerning the machine tool industry, is presented in the paper. The results of this research are a set of guidelines for the development of a digital factory support tool. (C) 2014 The Authrs. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Constantinescu, C.

Multi-Agent Systems aim to solve problems in a flexible and robust way by assembling sets of agents interacting in cooperative or competitive ways for the sake of possibly common objectives. Multi-Agent Systems have been applied to several domains ranging from many industrial sectors, e-commerce, health and even entertainment. Agent-Based Modeling, a sort of Multi-Agent Systems, is a technique used to study complex systems in a wide range of domains. A natural or social system can be represented, modeled and explained through a simulation based on agents and interactions. Such a simulation can comprise a variety of agent architectures like reactive and cognitive agents. Despite cognitive agents being highly relevant to simulate social systems due their capability of modelling aspects of human behaviour ranging from individuals to crowds, they still have not been applied extensively. A challenging and socially relevant domain are the Disaster-Rescue simulations that can benefit from using cognitive agents to develop a realistic simulation. In this paper, a Multi-Agent System applied to the Disaster-Rescue domain involving cognitive agents based on the Belief-Desire-Intention architecture is presented. The system aims to bridge the gap in combining Agent-Based Modelling and Multi-Agent Systems approaches by integrating two major platforms in the field of Agent-Based Modeling and Belief-Desire Intention multi-agent systems, namely, NetLogo and Jason.","[Arturo Luna-Ramirez, Wulfrano; Fasli, Maria] Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Arturo Luna-Ramirez, Wulfrano] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Dept Tecnol Informac, Unidad Cuajimalpa, Mexico City 05348, DF, Mexico; [Fasli, Maria] Univ Essex, Inst Analyt & Data Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; University of Essex,"Luna-Ramirez, WA (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.;Luna-Ramirez, WA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Dept Tecnol Informac, Unidad Cuajimalpa, Mexico City 05348, DF, Mexico.",waluna@essex.ac.uk; mfasli@essex.ac.uk,"Luna-Ramírez, Wulfrano/AAZ-1371-2021","Luna-Ramirez, Wulfrano Arturo/0000-0001-6741-6279",SEP-DSA/UAM-169 [48510384],SEP-DSA/UAM-169,"We would like to express our thanks to project No. 48510384 of SEP-DSA/UAM-169, for the support provided for this work.",,32,7,7,0,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-431X,,,COMPUTERS,Computers,JUN,2018,7,2,,,,,,,24,10.3390/computers7020024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/computers7020024,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,GK8QR,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,2024-11-15,WOS:000436492500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Concurrently, recent advancements in speech recognition substantially enhanced its accuracy, creating opportunities for speech-based interactions in gameplay. Integrating speech into single-player games with non-player characters (NPCs) introduces a new social dimension. Yet, like toxicity in social media and multiplayer games, anti-social behavior can infiltrate NPC interactions, generating a toxic gaming atmosphere. We designed a speech-based game called A Day at the Office and conducted a within-subject study with 26 participants to explore player interactions with NPCs possessing different human qualities. Furthermore, we introduced courtesy-based game mechanics, where NPCs react to players' choice of words and loudness, investigating player experiences. Results revealed that participants spoke differently with NPCs based on their human qualities, such as gender and hierarchical roles. Moreover, the courtesy-based interactions fostered greater cognitive engagement, suggesting that tactful interactions contribute to enhanced immersion and presence in the game.

There are a number of influencing factors such as increasing urban and aging populations, self-driving cars, 3D parts printing, energy innovation, and new models of transportation service delivery (Zipcar, Uber). The connected car means that vehicles are now part of the connected world, continuously Internet-connected, generating and transmitting data, which on the one hand can be helpfully integrated into applications, like real-time traffic alerts broadcast to smartwatches, but also raises security and privacy concerns. This paper explores the automotive connected world, and describes five killer QS (Quantified Self)-auto sensor applications that link quantified-self sensors (sensors that measure the personal biometrics of individuals like heart rate) and automotive sensors (sensors that measure driver and passenger biometrics or quantitative automotive performance metrics like speed and braking activity). The applications are fatigue detection, real-time assistance for parking and accidents, anger management and stress reduction, keyless authentication and digital identity verification, and DIY diagnostics. These kinds of applications help to demonstrate the benefit of connected world data streams in the automotive industry and beyond where, more fundamentally for human progress, the automation of both physical and now cognitive tasks is underway.","[Swan, Melanie] Kingston Univ London, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Swan, M (corresponding author), Kingston Univ London, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",m@melanieswan.com,,,Toyota's Collaborative Safety Research Center,Toyota's Collaborative Safety Research Center,This work was sponsored in part by Toyota's Collaborative Safety Research Center.,,59,53,60,1,26,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2224-2708,,,J SENS ACTUAR NETW,J.

An experimental study addressing complex cognitive skill retrieval,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Refresher training; Visual cueing; Attention guidance; Complex task; Retrieval,PROCESS-CONTROL TASK; EPISODIC MEMORY; RETENTION; SYSTEMS; DECAY,"Skills required for non-routine situations are learned in initial training but are rarely applied during work. Such skills decay if they are not rehearsed repeatedly, e.g. in refresher interventions. A promising concept to counteract skill decay is gaze guiding, which has the potential to reduce the consequences of skill decay by means of cued recall. The present study explores whether gaze guiding can be used as an alternative to refresher interventions. Fifty-five participants learned a complex cognitive skill required for a production task. After two weeks, they recalled the initially learned skill either with support of the gaze-guiding tool (Gaze-Guiding group) or without support (Practice-refresher intervention group or Control group). The participants of the Practice refresher intervention group repeated the initially learned skill in week 2. The results show that gaze guiding supports the precise execution of a task and is a promising technical tool for cued recall and retrieval support. Relevance to industry: Refresher interventions are popular methods for skill retention. A resource-saving alternative is an adaptive computer-based job aid which supports the operator's skill retrieval in the recall situation. It is a further development of step-by-step guidance with computer-based procedures and appears only when the operator fails to remember the task operation.","[Frank, Barbara; Kluge, Annette] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Business Psychol, Dept Work Org & Business Psychol, Fac Psychol, Bldg GAFO 04-273,Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Frank, B (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Business Psychol, Dept Work Org & Business Psychol, Fac Psychol, Bldg GAFO 04-273,Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",barbara.frank@rub.de,"Kluge, Annette/AAX-3178-2020","Kluge, Annette/0000-0002-8123-0427","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) [KL2207/3-3]","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The research was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) [KL2207/3-3].",,48,6,6,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-8141,1872-8219,,INT J IND ERGONOM,Int.

The unsafe behavior cognitive factors (UBCFs) are essential determinants contributing to human failure. This study aimed at eliciting the most important UBCFs, along with investigating hierarchical cause-effect interactions among them. A qualitative approach using metasynthesis was utilized to extract all essential UBCFs among industrial workplaces. Afterward, the relationships between UBCFs were recognized using the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method and rated by an expert panel. Also, a hierarchical model was developed based on the final matrix of DEMATEL by employing the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method. Ten criteria were extracted as UBCFs through the metasynthesis method. The threshold value was set as 0.175 in DEMATEL following experts' ideas. Inadequacy of persons' resilience and habitual rule ignorance were recognized as the most important predictive UBCFs. The developed model was tested through a case study in a petrochemical company. The results of the study can be used to help industrial managers and HSE practitioners to consider workers' capabilities either cognitively or physically when designing the required tasks to reduce unsafe behaviors. Also, the findings of the study are applicable for other researchers to prioritize the most important factors affecting unsafe behavior in different workplaces.","[Shakerian, Mahnaz; Choobineh, Alireza] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Shiraz, Iran; [Jahangiri, Mehdi] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Res Ctr Hlth Sci, Shiraz, Iran; [Alimohammadlou, Moslem] Shiraz Univ, Dept Management, Fac Econ Management & Social Sci, Shiraz, Iran; [Nami, Mohammad] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Adv Med Sci & Technol, Dept Neurosci, Shiraz, Iran; [Hasanzadeh, Jafar] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Epidmiol, Shiraz, Iran",Shiraz University of Medical Science; Shiraz University of Medical Science; Shiraz University; Shiraz University of Medical Science; Shiraz University of Medical Science,"Choobineh, A (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Shiraz, Iran.",shakerian.mahnaz@gmail.com; alrchoobin@sums.ac.ir; jahangiri_m@sums.ac.ir; mslmaml@shirazu.ac.ir; torabinami@sums.ac.ir; jafarabolhasan@yahoo.com,"Alimohammadlou, Moslem/R-7854-2019; Choobineh, Alireza/H-4554-2011; Nami, Mohammad/AAL-6280-2021; Jahangiri, Mehdi/F-2541-2014","choobineh, alireza/0000-0002-0866-0404; Shakerian, Mahnaz/0000-0002-6830-3046; Alimohammadlou, Moslem/0000-0002-9463-7285; Jahangiri, Mehdi/0000-0002-4703-2523",Shiraz University of Medical Sciences [95-01-04-11410],Shiraz University of Medical Sciences(Shiraz University of Medical Science),"This study was financially supported by the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, grant no. 95-01-04-11410.

Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal single-site ethnographic case study using digital processing to make a material receiving process Lean was adopted. An inherent knowledge process with internal stakeholders in a stimulated situation alongside process requirements was performed to achieve quality data collection. The results of the narrative analysis and process observation, combined with a literature review identified widely used Lean tools, wastes and biases that produced a model for the relationships. Findings The study established the relationships between bias, Lean tools and wastes which enabled 97.6% error reduction, improved on-time accounting and eliminated three working hours per day. These savings resulted in seven employees being redeployed to new areas with delivery time for products reduced by seven days. Research limitations/implications The single site case study with a supporting literature survey underpinning the model would benefit from testing the model in application to different industries and locations. Practical implications Application of the model can identify potential relationships between a group of human biases, 25 Lean tools and 10 types of wastes in Lean manufacturing processes that support decision makers and line managers in productivity improvement. The model can be used to identify potential relationships between forms of human biases, Lean tools and types of wastes in Lean manufacturing processes and take suitable remedial actions. The influence of biases and the model could be used as a basis to counter implementation barriers and reduce system-wide wastes. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that connects the cognitive perspectives of Lean business processes with waste production and human biases. As part of the process, a relationship model is derived.","[Purushothaman, Mahesh Babu; Seadon, Jeff] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Future Environm, Dept Built Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Moore, Dave] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology; Auckland University of Technology,"Purushothaman, MB (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Future Environm, Dept Built Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.",mahesh.babu@aut.ac.nz,"Purushothaman, Mahesh Babu/HMO-7299-2023","Mahesh Babu, Purushothaman/0000-0001-5062-272X",,,,,143,10,10,8,91,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2040-4166,2040-4174,,INT J LEAN SIX SIG,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - Cognitive analytics management (CAM) framework (Osman and Anouz, 2014) is used. Cognitive process: The right questions are asked to understand the behavior of every process and the flow of its corresponding data; critical data variables were identified, guidelines for identifying data sources were set. Analytics process: Techniques of data analytics were applied to the selected data sets, problems were identified in user-system interaction and in the system design. The analysis process helped the management in the management process to make right decisions for the right change. Findings - Using the CAM framework, the analysis to the Lebanese Red Cross case study identified system user-behavior problems and also system design problems. It identified cases where distributed subsystems are vulnerable to time keeping errors and helped the management make knowledgeable decisions to overcome major obstacles by implementing several changes related to hardware design, software implementation, human resource training, operational and human-technology changes. CAM is a novel and feasible software engineering approach for handling system failures. Originality/value - The paper uses CAM framework as an approach to overcome system failures and help management do the needed changes to enhance such a critical process. This work contributes to the software engineering literature by introducing CAM as a new agile methodology to be used when dealing with system failures. Furthermore, this study is an action research that validated the CAM theoretical framework in a health emergency context in Lebanon.","[Tarhini, Abbas; Balozain, Puzant; Srour, F.

Thus, advanced technologies offer the potential to overcome those limitations and improve inspection quality. Method-This paper compares the performance of human operators with image processing, artificial intelligence software and 3D scanning for different types of inspection. The results were statistically analysed in terms of inspection accuracy, consistency and time. Additionally, other factors relevant to operations were assessed using a SWOT and weighted factor analysis. Results-The results show that operators' performance in screen-based inspection tasks was superior to inspection software due to their strong cognitive abilities, decision-making capabilities, versatility and adaptability to changing conditions. In part-based inspection however, 3D scanning outperformed the operator while being significantly slower. Overall, the strength of technological systems lies in their consistency, availability and unbiasedness. Conclusions-The performance of inspection software should improve to be reliably used in blade inspection. While 3D scanning showed the best results, it is not always technically feasible (e.g., in a borescope inspection) nor economically viable.

Capabilities of precise sensing and seamless interactions with human subjects are pivotal to boosting versatile Internet of Everything (IoE) applications. However, it is challenging to attain various kinds of intuitive sensing based on one edge sensor. A novel silicon-based phased-array coherent radar sensing platform is proposed to attain versatile application-driven capabilities by focusing the wideband radar beams accurately at the target's direction to attain precise sensing. The coherent radar platform can support a maximum 60 degrees field-of-view sensing range with smaller than 2 degrees optimum steering step resolution and -70-dBm sensitivity. The silicon-based mixed-signal coherent radar chip platform is fabricated by a 65-nm CMOS process and owns the convenience for massive deployments at the edge. A series of experiments were conducted to validate the integrated radar platform's adaptable capabilities and salient performances on human subject detection, vital signs monitoring, and motion recognition. Notably, the adaptable multifunction integrated radar platform opens up the enticing possibility for next-generation monolithic edge devices supporting seamless health sensing and cognitive interactive functions with human subjects.","[Fang, Zhongyuan; Tang, Kai; Lou, Liheng; Wang, Wensong; Chen, Bo; Wang, Yisheng; Zheng, Yuanjin] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Tang, K; Lou, LH; Zheng, YJ (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",zfang005@e.ntu.edu.sg; ktang@ntu.edu.sg; lhlou@sjtu.edu.cn; wangws@ntu.edu.sg; chen-bo@ntu.edu.sg; yisheng_wang@mymail.sutd.edu.sg; yjzheng@ntu.edu.sg,"/ABA-3020-2020; Zheng, Yuanjin/A-5133-2011; Wang, Yi-Sheng/HII-5157-2022; Fang, Zhongyuan/GPT-0421-2022","Fang, Zhongyuan/0000-0002-6499-4353",SingaporeMOE AcRF Tier 2 [MOE2019-T2-2-179],"SingaporeMOE AcRF Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore)",This work was supported by SingaporeMOE AcRF Tier 2 under Grant MOE2019-T2-2-179.,,52,11,11,0,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1932-4545,1940-9990,,IEEE T BIOMED CIRC S,IEEE Trans.

Decisions can be highly complex due to the high amount of influencing factors that have to be considered simultaneously. Among other methods and tools, decision support systems (DSS) were developed to support decision-makers in handling complex decisions. One main disadvantage of DSS is the little adaptation to and integration of decision-maker needs and characteristics. Thus, current trends focus on the development of human-and decision-maker-centered DSS. This paper aims in providing a multilevel stepwise procedure for the modeling of decision-makers in order to enable a more effective decision support. The decision-maker modeling procedure is based on findings from literature research and results from research projects performed in cooperation with industry partners. The procedure serves as a guideline for generating diverse decision-maker models for different applications and for integrating human cognitive thinking procedures within the design and functionality of decision support methodologies and systems. The procedure represents an important design element of the human-centered decision support methodology currently being developed at the Institute of Product Development of the Technische Universitat Munchen (Germany).","[Olmez, Manuela; Lindemann, Udo] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Prod Dev, D-85735 Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Ölmez, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Prod Dev, Boltzmannstr 18, D-81735 Garching, Germany.",manuela.oelmez@pe.mw.tum.de,,,,,,,26,0,0,2,15,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0922-6389,,978-1-61499-399-5; 978-1-61499-398-8,FRONT ARTIF INTEL AP,,,2014,261,,,,,,429,440,,10.3233/978-1-61499-399-5-429,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-399-5-429,,,12,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BC1KF,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000350220100038,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our goal is to provide guidance for future evaluations of MR/AR approaches. To this end, we characterize publications by paper type (e.g., technique, design study), research topic (e.g., tracking, rendering), evaluation scenario (e.g., algorithm performance, user performance), cognitive aspects (e.g., perception, emotion), and the context in which evaluations were conducted (e.g., lab vs. in-thewild). We found a strong coupling of types, topics, and scenarios. We observe two groups: (a) technology-centric performance evaluations of algorithms that focus on improving tracking, displays, reconstruction, rendering, and calibration, and (b) human-centric studies that analyze implications of applications and design, human factors on perception, usability, decision making, emotion, and attention. Amongst the 458 papers, we identified 248 user studies that involved 5,761 participants in total, of whom only 1,619 were identified as female. We identified 43 data collection methods used to analyze 10 cognitive aspects. We found nine objective methods, and eight methods that support qualitative analysis. A majority (216/248) of user studies are conducted in a laboratory setting. Often (138/248), such studies involve participants in a static way. However, we also found a fair number (30/248) of in-the-wild studies that involve participants in a mobile fashion.

Pi-Mind agents can learn the decision-making capabilities of their donors in a specific training environment based on generative adversarial networks. A trained clone can be used by a decision-maker as an additional resource for one's own cognitive enhancement, as an autonomous representative, or even as a replacement when appropriate. The assumption regarding this approach is as follows: when someone was forced to leave a critical process because of, for example, sickness, or wanted to take care of several simultaneously running processes, then they would be more confident knowing that their autonomous digital representatives were as capable and predictable as their exact personal copy. The Pi-Mind agent was evaluated in a Ukrainian higher education environment and a military logistics laboratory.

Very little is known about these newly-created working environments and their effects on cognition. The present study focused on a novel practice, interlingual respeaking (IRSP), where real-time subtitles in another language are created through the interaction between a human and ASR software. To this end, we set up an experiment that included a purpose-made training course on IRSP over 5 weeks, investigating its effects on cognition, and focusing on executive functioning (EF) and working memory (WM). We compared the cognitive performance of 51 language professionals before and after the course. Our variables were reading span (a complex WM measure), switching skills, and sustained attention. IRSP training course improved complex WM and switching skills but not sustained attention. However, the participants were slower after the training, indicating increased vigilance with the sustained attention tasks. Finally, complex WM was confirmed as the primary competence in IRSP.

The guidance information generated by GLV is geometric level AR instruction, which contains the product manufacturing information of the object to be assembled. Users need to convert geometric level AR instructions into understandable assembly relationships, so as to understand the assembly tasks to be performed, which greatly reduce the efficiency of users. In fact, users use different logical constraints to organize the corresponding assembly relationships. Logical constraints include fixed constraints and real-time constraints, which reflect the combination of human intelligence and assembly processes at the information level. Among them, fixed constraints are used to represent assembly relationships, and real-time constraints are used to represent hidden manual rules in assembly relationships. These rules are the key information to guide users to establish an assembly relationship. They are usually adaptive information generated by users after understanding the assembly relationship. Although we propose an information-level visualization method (ILV), which can transform fixed constraints into computer-generated graphics, neither GLV nor ILV can use AR instructions to express the manual rules behind assembly relationships. Therefore, we propose an information-level real-time visualization method (IRV), which transforms real-time constraints into computer-generated real-time graphics, called information level real-time AR instruction (IRAI). In a case study, we analyzed and compared the performance of participants under real-time AR instructions with different information levels. This research shows that a high cognitive level of IRAI can make individuals have better performance in work efficiency and cognitive efficiency.

As HRC scenarios in manufacturing become increasingly popular, robot action decision-making needs to consider such properties of humans. In previous studies, humans are usually regarded as rational agents whose behaviors are predictable and planned. Still, humans are susceptible to distractions caused by external disturbances, and different cognitive processes of the task can produce unpredictable behaviors. To better simulate human bounded rational behavior, based on an intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) multi-attribute decision algorithm, we propose a cobot action decision-making method that integrates human intention, safety, and efficiency, to produce a human-like decision. We use the IF set to calculate the score and accuracy values of two Nash equilibria of a static chicken game, which can predict human action intentions with collision risk and provide optimal action decisions for the robot simultaneously. We generated 10,000 sets of data using the Monte Carlo method and validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it with MDP and POMDP methods. The results showed that the decision-making method could effectively perform the task of making action decisions for the robot. Simulation experiments and Turing test results show that our proposed method can predict a human's subjective action decision intention in a situation with potential collision risk with 85.62% accuracy. At the same time, the experimental participants believe that the robot can get 4.83 out of 5 satisfaction points for an action decision.","[Liu, Bo; Fu, Weiping; Wang, Wen; Gao, Zhiqiang; Li, Rui; Peng, Lixia; Du, Huilong; Chen, Xiaohu] Xian Univ Technol, Sch Mech & Precis Instrument Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Fu, Weiping; Peng, Lixia; Chen, Xiaohu] Xian Int Univ, Sch Engn, Xian 710077, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Technology,"Fu, WP (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, Sch Mech & Precis Instrument Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",weipingf@xaut.edu.cn,"meng, meng/KHW-8303-2024",,"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi [2022JQ-546, 2022JQ-402]; Key Laboratory Scientific Research Program [13JS070]",Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); Key Laboratory Scientific Research Program,"This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi under Grant 2022JQ-402, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi under Grant 2022JQ-546, and in part by the Key Laboratory Scienti~c Research Program under Project 13JS070.",,26,4,4,3,25,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,10,,,,,,103349,103363,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3205305,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3205305,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,5C3GJ,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000864151600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data generated from images captured from mobile devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, wearable sensors, building information modeling (BIM), and others present an opportunity for construction safety professionals and in many other sectors to analyze and benefit from the insights generated from the data using AI, machine learning and deep learning systems. For example, AI-based algorithms can be used to scan images from jobsites for safety hazards, such as workers not wearing protective equipment, and correlate the images with accident records; identify unsafe worker behavior and suggest training and education priorities; or track the real-time interactions of workers, machinery, and objects on the site and alert supervisors of potential safety issues.

Considering AI's immense potential, this study aims to synthesize emerging trends of artificial intelligence in electrical safety.","[Doherty, Mike] eHazard, Oshawa, ON, Canada; [Esmaeili, Behzad] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Doherty, M (corresponding author), eHazard, Oshawa, ON, Canada.",mike.doherty@e-hazard.com; besmaeil@gmu.edu,,"Esmaeili, Behzad/0000-0003-3858-1843",,,,,48,0,0,2,19,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2326-3288,,978-1-7281-6438-0,IEEE IAS ELECTR SAFE,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/esw42757.2020.9188324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/esw42757.2020.9188324,,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BS1TN,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000696157100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Effective HrT relies on the success of complex and dynamic human-robot interaction. Although it may be optimal for robots to possess all the social and emotional skills to function as productive team members, certain cognitive capabilities can enable them to develop attitude-based competencies for optimizing teams. Despite the extensive research into the human-human team structure, the domain of HrT research remains relatively limited. In this sense, incorporating established human-human teaming (HhT) elements may prove practical. One key element is mutual performance monitoring (MPM), which involves the reciprocal observation and active anticipation of team members' actions within the team setting, fostering enhanced team coordination and communication. By adopting this concept, this study uses ML-based visual action recognition as a potential tool for developing an effective way to monitor the human component in HrT. This study utilizes a data modeling approach on an existing dataset, the Industrial Human Action Recognition Dataset (InHARD), curated specifically for human action recognition assembly tasks in industrial environments involving human-robot collaborations. This paper presents the results of this modeling approach in analyzing the dataset to implement a theoretical concept that can be a first step toward enabling the system to adapt dynamically. The outcomes emphasize the significance of implementing state-of-the-art team concepts by integrating modern technologies and assessing the possibility of advancing HrT in this direction.","[Mehak, Shakra; Guilfoyle, Michael] Pilz Ireland Ind Automat, Cork T12AW80, Ireland; [Mehak, Shakra; Leva, Maria Chiara] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Food Sci & Environm Hlth, Dublin D07H6K8, Ireland; [Kelleher, John D.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Stat, Dublin D02PN40, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Mehak, S (corresponding author), Pilz Ireland Ind Automat, Cork T12AW80, Ireland.;Mehak, S; Leva, MC (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Food Sci & Environm Hlth, Dublin D07H6K8, Ireland.",s.mehak@pilz.ie; john.kelleher@tcd.ie; m.guilfoyle@pilz.ie; mariachiara.leva@tudublin.ie,"; Kelleher, John D./N-6963-2017","Leva, Maria Chiara/0000-0002-6770-8332; Mehak, Shakra/0000-0002-9118-1569; Kelleher, John D./0000-0001-6462-3248",Collaborative Intelligence for Safety-Critical Systems (CISC),Collaborative Intelligence for Safety-Critical Systems (CISC),No Statement Available,,55,1,1,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-1702,,MACHINES,Machines,JAN,2024,12,1,,,,,,,45,10.3390/machines12010045,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines12010045,,,16,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,GE3F6,,gold,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001150944100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined the characteristics that make scientific journal articles appeal to HF/E researchers and practitioners using a web-based survey. HF/E researchers and practitioners were more similar than expected in judgements of important attributes and the selection of articles. Both practitioners and researchers considered practical significance to be more important than theoretical significance, in direct contrast to professionals from a related discipline - psychology. Well-written articles were appreciated across disciplines. The results signal a strong interest in practical applications in HF/E, but a relative lack of focus on development of theories that should be the basis for practical applications. Practitioner Summary: HF/E researchers and practitioners make similar choices of journal articles and view presentation quality and practical significance as high but theory as low in determining the impact of articles, indicating a smaller than expected research-practice gap and that HF/E should encourage stronger focus on theory to ensure its continuing development.","[Chung, Amy Z.

Background Existing evidence regarding the effect of experience on hazard recognition performance in the construction industry remains inconsistent. Behavior-wise, identification of dominant hazard recognition factors (sensitivity or response bias, or both) would help determine appropriate training strategies to improve hazard recognition. In terms of neuro-responses, induced gamma-band activity was expected to reflect the cognitive functions mediating the psychological effects of experience. Method Seventy-seven construction workers participated in a predesigned hazard recognition task, in which participants judged whether a hazard was present from a series of construction scenario pictures. We computed and compared the sensitivity and response bias of SDT and time-frequency representations of recorded EEG signals of the two experience-level groups. Results Novice workers had higher hazard recognition rates. Behavior-wise, novices were more sensitive than more experienced workers. Compared with experienced workers, novices showed stronger gamma-band difference power (hazardous minus safe) in the left frontal and right posterior parietal areas during the hazard recognition process. Conclusion Novices performed better at hazard recognition, indicating their sensitivity to the hazards without a clear difference in response bias. Based on the EEG data, novices' sensitivity may be attributed to more efficient working memory and attentional control. Application There is a need for continuous refreshment of hazard recognition skills for experienced workers for safety interventions.","[Zhou, Xiaoshan; Liao, Pin-Chao; Xu, Qingwen] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Liao, PC (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",pinchao@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Liao, Pin-Chao/Z-3750-2019",,,,,,71,7,7,18,60,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

However, the evidence of the efficacy of technology is insufficient to ensure its uptake in industry. In the absence of a theoretical frame of reference, we mainly rely on best practices and expert judgment from industry-academia collaboration and software process improvement research to improve the acceptance of the proposed technology.Objective: To identify acceptance models and theories and discuss their applicability in the research of acceptance behavior related to software development.Method: We analyzed literature reviews within an interdisciplinary team to identify models and theories relevant to software engineering research. We further discuss acceptance behavior from the human information processing perspective of automatic and affect-driven processes (fastsystem 1 thinking) and rational and rule-governed processes (slowsystem 2 thinking).Results: We identified 30 potentially relevant models and theories. Several of them have been used in researching acceptance behavior in contexts related to software development, but few have been validated in such contexts.They use constructs that capture aspects of (automatic) system 1 and (rational) system 2 oriented processes. However, their operationalizations focus on system 2 oriented processes indicating a rational view of behavior, thus overlooking important psychological processes underpinning behavior. Conclusions: Software engineering research may use acceptance behavior models and theories more extensively to understand and predict practice adoption in the industry. Such theoretical foundations will help improve the impact of software engineering research. However, more consideration should be given to their validation, overlap, construct operationalization, and employed data collection mechanisms when using these models and theories.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

This is an adaptation of the regulations, relative to processes from the texts of law of general order towards their implementation in a context [I]. We have analyzed these processes according to the instrumental approach of Rabardel [2]. In this perspective, we focus on the safety workers' systems of instruments [3-8]. These resources, developed according to the workers' experience, render their activity more reliable. They are also of heterogeneous character: simultaneously material, symbolic or of cognitive order. The systems of instruments present certain properties, in particular being structured according to the experience and skills of the workers, but also characterized by the complementarities and redundancies of their functions, following the example of a security system; this takes into account the elements of the context, the constraints and the resources of the activity [3]. In the following case study, we present the system of instruments of a preventionist, in which the regulations function as a pivot instrument of this system. It is from the regulations that the worker establishes the diagnosis of the safety level of his or her company and develops his or her preventive and formative actions [9].

To attract more tourists, the surrounding environment of a scenic region is usually well developed, attracting a large number of human activities, which creates a cognitive range for the scenic region. From the perspective of tourism, tourists' perceptions of the region in which tourist attractions are located in a city usually differ from the objective region of the scenic spots. Among them, social media serves as an important medium for tourists to share information about scenic spots and for potential tourists to learn scenic spot information, and it interacts to influence people's perceptions of the destination image. Extracting the names of tourist attractions from social media data and exploring their spatial distribution patterns is the basis for research on the cognitive region of tourist attractions. This study takes Hangzhou, a well-known tourist city in China, as a case study to explore the human cognitive region of its popular scenic spots. First, we propose a Chinese tourist attraction name extraction model based on RoBERTa-BiLSTM-CRF to extract the names of tourist attractions from social media data. Then, we use a multi-distance spatial clustering method called Ripley's K to filter the extracted tourist attraction names. Finally, we combine road network data and polygons generated using the chi-shape algorithm to construct the vague cognitive regions of each scenic spot. The results show that the classification indicators of our proposed tourist attraction name extraction model are significantly better than those of previous toponym extraction models and algorithms (precision = 0.7371, recall = 0.6926, F1 = 0.7141), and the extracted vague cognitive regions of tourist attractions also generally conform to people's habitual cognition.","[Zhang, Chengkun; Zhang, Yiran; Yang, Jing; Wang, Yuanyuan; Xu, Liuchang] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiajun; Yao, Junwei; Liu, Hongjiu; He, Tao; Zheng, Xinyu; Xue, Xingyu; Xu, Liuchang] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xinyu; Xue, Xingyu; Xu, Liuchang] Key Lab Forestry Intelligent Monitoring & Informat, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xinyu; Xue, Xingyu; Xu, Liuchang] Key Lab State Forestry & Grassland Adm Forestry Se, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Educ, Hangzhou 310014, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuanyuan] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Acad, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liuchang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310063, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liuchang] Sunyard Technol Co Ltd, Financial Big Data Res Inst, Hangzhou 310053, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang University of Technology; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Xu, LC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.;Xu, LC (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.;Xu, LC (corresponding author), Key Lab Forestry Intelligent Monitoring & Informat, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.;Xu, LC (corresponding author), Key Lab State Forestry & Grassland Adm Forestry Se, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.;Xu, LC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310063, Peoples R China.;Xu, LC (corresponding author), Sunyard Technol Co Ltd, Financial Big Data Res Inst, Hangzhou 310053, Peoples R China.",zhangchengkun@zju.edu.cn; sjzjj@stu.zafu.edu.cn; sjyjw@stu.zafu.edu.cn; joe_hunter@zafu.edu.cn; hetao@zafu.edu.cn; zhengxinyu@zafu.edu.cn; wangyuanyuanxy@zju.edu.cn; xuliuchang@zafu.edu.cn,"Wang, Yuanyuan/R-5722-2017; Yao, JW/HJA-7097-2022; Zhang, Jiajun/IWD-9444-2023","Zhang, Chengkun/0000-0001-6341-1403; xue, xingyu/0000-0002-2011-9602; Xu, Liang/0000-0003-3889-927X; Xu, Liuchang/0000-0001-7635-7266; Liu, Hongjiu/0000-0001-8175-264X; He, Tao/0000-0001-5304-3010","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42050103, 42001354]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LGG22D010001, LQ19D010011, LY18G010005, LY17G020025]; Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department [Y202147381]; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [18YJA630030, 21YJA630054]; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science Program of China [17NDJC262YB, 19NDJC240YB]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science Program of China,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 42050103, 42001354; the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, Grant No. LGG22D010001, LQ19D010011, LY18G010005, LY17G020025; the Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, Grant No. Y202147381; the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China, Grant No. 18YJA630030, 21YJA630054; and the Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Science Program of China, Grant No. 17NDJC262YB, 19NDJC240YB.",,53,5,5,6,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Digital technologies are not only a tool, but also a living environment of modern human, which opens up new opportunities: learning at any convenient time, continuing education, the ability to form individual educational learning trajectories and more. However, the digital environment requires teachers to take a modern approach to the organization of the educational process, the formation of new skills and abilities to work in the digital educational environment. As a result of the study, it was found that the system of vocational education should provide training for masters of industrial training who have a high level of digital competence. The purpose of the article is to single out, theoretically substantiate and determine the level of formation of structural components of digital competence of future masters of agricultural training. The structure of digital competence of agricultural master was analyzed on the basis of domestic and foreign scientists researches. Systematized research results indicate that digital competence consists of four components: motivational-value (combination of internal and external motives for the use of digital technologies in future professional activities), cognitive (a set of theoretical knowledge, skills and abilities of future master of industrial training to effectively build educational process with the use of digital technologies), activity-professional (expansion and deepening of knowledge, skills, necessary skills for effective implementation of digital technologies in the educational process) and evaluative-reflexive (ability to analyze and self-analyze own activities and its results taking into account professional characteristics, self-realization in professional activities through the use of digital technologies). These components are comparable with the indicators that describe the knowledge, skills and abilities needed by the future master of industrial training to organize the modern educational process. A questionnaire was conducted to determine the levels of this competence formation, which allows us to conclude that it is necessary to increase the level of formation of all components of digital competence of future masters of industrial training in agriculture. The results of the study can be used as a basis for the development of disciplines that form the special competencies of masters of industrial training in agriculture and programs of advanced training of teachers.","[Kovalchuk, Vasyl; Zaika, Artem] Oleksandr Dovzhenko Hlukhiv Natl Pedag Univ, Fac Technol & Profess Educ, 54 Kyevo Moskovska St, UA-41400 Hlukhiv, Ukraine; [Hriadushcha, Vira; Kucherak, Iryna] Univ Educ Management NAPS Ukraine, Bila Tserkva Inst Continuous Profess Educ SIHE, 52-4 Levanevskoho St, UA-09108 Bila Tserkva, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Oleksandr Dovzhenko Hlukhiv National Pedagogical University,"Kovalchuk, V (corresponding author), Oleksandr Dovzhenko Hlukhiv Natl Pedag Univ, Fac Technol & Profess Educ, 54 Kyevo Moskovska St, UA-41400 Hlukhiv, Ukraine.",,"Kucherak, Iryna/ABW-5945-2022; Заїка, Артем/HCI-6400-2022; Kovalchuk, Vasyl/W-7299-2019","Kovalchuk, Vasyl/0000-0002-5006-573X",,,,,26,1,1,2,11,INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS,SEOUL,"DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA",1738-7906,,,INT J COMPUT SCI NET,Int.

This is one of the biggest problem today both in the mobile industry and among users as well. The engineers try to reduce the energy usage not just through hardware optimization but also software solutions are made. These solutions are mostly unsuitable for everyday usage, but what happens if we optimize the energy consumption based on the most frequent user habits? The users usually use their devices to be continuously notified about the latest messages, activities, phone calls etc. This behavior can be sometimes unnecessary, for example during the night it is not important to synchronize all e-mails of the users. From that point of view, the users and their devices can form a socio-cognitive channel, which can help to create behavior-based technologies. In this paper we introduce a model which represents the most common smartphone usage scenarios using Markov chains. Based on this model we make suggestions how the processes can be modified to improve the energy consumption of the mobile devices.","[Fekete, Krisztian; Csorba, Kristof] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Automat & Appl Informat, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Fekete, K (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Automat & Appl Informat, Budapest, Hungary.",fekete.krisztian@aut.bme.hu; csorba.kristof@aut.bme.hu,"Csorba, Kristóf/G-7744-2012",,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4799-7280-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,481,486,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BG4YW,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000389273200087,View Full Record in Web of Science

That is, there are large quantities of data and information (volume) arriving at a high rate (velocity) which are, in general, highly heterogeneous (variety) and of inconsistent fidelity (veracity). Making sound decisions based on these observations is the aim and human decision making is essential, since humans are ultimately held responsible. Current industry tools are designed to support this process, by helping to process and curate the collection of observations automatically, storing it in databases and providing various analytical tools to retrieve and manipulate fragments of the collection. However, industry approaches for managing the inherent uncertainty in these observations and exploiting all the available higher level contextual information are inadequate. What is needed is a practical formalism that can deal with multiple types of uncertainty, can exploit contextual information and can operate at scale to reduce the cognitive burden on analysts. In this paper, we discuss the use of Markov logic networks for handling uncertainty and exploiting higher level contextual information and demonstrate how this provides a framework which is well suited to handling the real-world issues encountered in intelligence-based problems.","[Oxenham, Martin; Ao, Zhuoyun] Def Sci & Technol Org, Joint & Operat Anal Div, Edinburgh, SA 5111, Australia; [Burgess, Glenn; El-Mahassni, Edwin] Def Sci & Technol Org, Natl Secur & ISR Div, Edinburgh, SA 5111, Australia",Defence Science & Technology; Defence Science & Technology,"Oxenham, M (corresponding author), Def Sci & Technol Org, Joint & Operat Anal Div, Edinburgh, SA 5111, Australia.",martin.oxenham@dsto.defence.gov.au; zhuoyun.ao@dsto.defence.gov.au; glenn.burgess@dsto.defence.gov.au; edwin.el-mahassni@dsto.defence.gov.au,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-0-9824-4386-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,2001,2008,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BG5KW,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000389523300261,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work looks at developing a cognitive architecture for assembly robots allowing prediction of when collaborative actions are required. The cognitive architecture provides reliable perception and reasoning methods for increased human-robot fluency allowing the user to focus on the required task. The system has three layers; the perception layer determines the current task state while the memory layer keeps track of task details, current predictions and past episodes. The control layer predicts future collaborative actions and passes commands to the robot at the required time to reduce user idle time. The system uses inertial measurement unit convolutional neural network action recognition and vision recognition for environment perception. The cognitive architecture is validated with experiments in offline and real-time modes. In offline mode, two action recognition methods are performed, with one classifier for all actions achieving accuracy of 81% and a separate classifier for each action achieving 74%. In real-time mode, a UR3 cobot is used for a collaborative assembly task where an increase in the proportion of time the user is active is shown.","[Male, James; Martinez-Hernandez, Uriel] Univ Bath, Inte R Act Lab, Ctr Autonomous Robot CENTAUR, Bath, Avon, England; [Male, James; Martinez-Hernandez, Uriel] Univ Bath, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Male, J (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Inte R Act Lab, Ctr Autonomous Robot CENTAUR, Bath, Avon, England.",jjm53@bath.ac.uk; u.martinez@bath.ac.uk,,"Martinez-Hernandez, Uriel/0000-0002-9922-7912; Fant-Male, James/0000-0003-3587-7593",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Royal Society [RGS/R2/192346]; EPSRC [2281852] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Royal Society(Royal Society); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Royal Society Research Grants for the 'Touching and feeling the immersive world' project (RGS/R2/192346),,16,3,3,4,16,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-3684-7,,,,2021,,,,,,,1024,1029,,10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659382,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,BS7RY,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000766318900154,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, applying common agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Lean to cultivate these capabilities inevitably introduces feedback ambiguity, which can paralyze decision-making and increase errors due to inherent human cognitive limitations. To address this, tailored carbon-zero feedback algorithms are proposed to complement human judgment in agile workflows. Specifically, prescriptive analytics, federated learning, and probabilistic programming are injected into Scrum, Kanban, and Lean respectively to restore clarity amidst ambiguity. The framework is grounded in cases from the textile industry to demonstrate applicability in practical settings. By targeting the roots of distortions with human-algorithm collaborations, it provides an actionable roadmap to implement carbon-zero agility.","[Lv, David Diwei; Cho, Erin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Fash & Text, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Lv, DD; Cho, ER (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Fash & Text, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",diweilyu@polyu.edu.hk; erin.cho@polyu.edu.hk,,,School of Fashion and Textiles at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University [P0049879],School of Fashion and Textiles at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University,We give special thanks to the editor and reviewers for the considerable time and effort they invested in this manuscript.

At present, there has been growing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) with cognitive abilities, for example in healthcare and the motoring industry. Research indicates that infants exhibit early signs in cognitive and social understanding, including some basic abilities related to beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs). Thus, the ability to attribute BDIs to others is also crucial for the development of machine ToM. In this article, we review recent progress in machine ToM on BDIs. And we shall introduce the experiments, datasets, and methods of machine ToM on these three aspects, summarize the development of different tasks and datasets in recent years, and compare well-behaved models in aspects of advantages, limitations, and applicable conditions, hoping that this study can guide researchers to quickly keep up with latest trend in this field. Unlike other domains with a specific task and resolution framework, machine ToM lacks a unified instruction and a series of standard evaluation tasks, which make it difficult to formally compare the proposed models. And the existing models still cannot exhibit the same ToM reasoning ability as real humans, lack of transferability, interpretability, few-shot learning, etc. We argue that, one method to address this difficulty is now to present a standard assessment criteria and dataset, better a large-scale dataset covered multiple aspects of ToM.

Moreover, a pandemic is a situation that requires strong government interventions, and we further examined whether employees' trust in the government would play a moderating role in explaining the effects of commitment HRM. With a multilevel framework, we measured commitment HRM via an analysis of big data provided online prior to the pandemic and matched the information to employees' responses collected from a survey after the outbreak of the pandemic. With data from 1010 employees and 52 companies, we found that employees in organizations with a higher utilization of commitment HRM showed less threat appraisals. Moreover, those experiencing fewer threat appraisals showed more commitment to their organizations. In addition, we found that the negative link between a company's commitment HRM and its employees' threat appraisals was pronounced when they had a lower level of trust in the government.

In this paper, we address the problem of teaching a robot collaborative behaviors from human demonstrations. Specifically, we present an approach that combines: probabilistic learning and dynamical systems, to encode the robot's motion along the task. Our method allows us to learn not only a desired path to take the object through, but also, the force the robot needs to apply to the load during the interaction. Moreover, the robot is able to learn and reproduce the task with varying initial and final locations of the object. The proposed approach can be used in scenarios where not only the path to be followed by the transported object matters, but also the force applied to it. Tests were successfully carried out in a scenario where a 7 DOFs backdrivable manipulator learns to cooperate, with a human, to transport an object while satisfying the position and force constraints of the task.","[Rozo, Leonel; Calinon, Sylvain; Caldwell, Darwin G.] I1T, Dept Adv Robot, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Calinon, Sylvain] Idiap Res Inst, CH-1920 Martigny, Switzerland",,"Rozo, L (corresponding author), I1T, Dept Adv Robot, Via Morego 30, I-16163 Genoa, Italy.",leonel.rozo@iit.it; sylvain.calinon@idiap.ch; darwin.caldwell@iit.it,"Calinon, Sylvain/I-7606-2014; Rozo, Leonel/HTP-2045-2023; Caldwell, Darwin/E-9954-2018","CALINON, Sylvain/0000-0002-9036-6799; Caldwell, Darwin/0000-0002-6233-9961",,,,,24,27,29,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1944-9445,,978-1-4799-6765-0,IEEE ROMAN,,,2014,,,,,,,619,624,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Robotics,BE0QJ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000366603200101,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, the understanding of human behavioural characteristics interlaced with current technology aspects and organisational context seems to be of paramount importance for the safety & reliability field. First, significant drawbacks related to the human performance data collection will be minimised by the development of a novel industrial accidents dataset, the Multi-attribute Technological Accidents Dataset (MATA-D), which groups 238 major accidents from different industrial backgrounds and classifies them under a common framework (the Contextual Control Model used as basis for the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method). The accidents collection and the detailed interpretation will provide a rich data source, enabling the usage of integrated information to generate input to design improvement schemes. Then, implications to improve robustness of system design and tackle the surrounding factors and tendencies that could lead to the manifestation of human errors will be effectively addressed.

Could the speed of this activity be doubled? This paper explores this hypothetical question, starting with examination of a diverse set of case studies spanning the activities of manufacturing. This reveals that the constraints on increasing manufacturing speed have some common themes, and several of these are examined in more detail, to identify absolute limits to performance. The physical processes of production are constrained by factors such as machine stiffness, actuator acceleration, heat transfer and the delivery of fluids, and for each of these, a simplified model is used to analyse the gap between current and limiting performance. The wider systems of production require the co-ordination of resources and push at the limits of human biophysical and cognitive limits. Evidence about these is explored and related to current practice. Out of this discussion, five promising innovations are explored to show examples of how manufacturing speed is increasing with line arrays of point actuators, parallel tools, tailored application of precision, hybridisation and task taxonomies. The paper addresses a broad question which could be pursued by a wider community and in greater depth, but even this first examination suggests the possibility of unanticipated innovations in current manufacturing practices.

In the construction industry, many accident investigations reveal that workers' unsafe behaviors are the most frequent and direct causes of on-site accidents, and thus need to be addressed urgently. Based on cognitive and social psychology theories and existing accident causation models, this paper develops a CM-CWUB by adopting a five-stage form, specifically representing the construction workers' cognitive processes when confronted with potential hazards on construction sites. Using a cognitive perspective can reveal the mechanism of human error and thus can elucidate how unsafe behaviors are produced. The five stages include obtaining information, understanding information, perceiving responses, selecting response, and taking action, with obtaining information and selecting response as the two key stages. Obtaining information elaborates construction workers' observations and processing of hazard information on sites by themselves, and selecting response adopts the theory of planned behavior to reflect various factors of influence when workers select unsafe behavior. Based on the developed model, cognitive failures that would lead to construction workers' unsafe behaviors at different cognitive stages are then systematically analyzed.","[Fang, Dongping; Zhao, Chen; Zhang, Mengchun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management, Tsinghua Gammon Construct Safety Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Fang, DP (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management, Tsinghua Gammon Construct Safety Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",fangdp@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [51378296, 71172013, 50978155, 71572088]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors would like to hereby thank Dr. Robert Webber of Tsinghua University for his careful editing and Mr. Qun Li in BCEG for his valuable suggestions for this research.

The new generation of Wireless Sensor Actor Networks (WSANs) technologies of sensing the environment, computing and communicating advances at faster rates. It can be conceived that the world will eventually be covered by networks of autonomous smart sensor-actor nodes which yields revolutionary applications. Nowadays WSAN can be considered as passive networks of sensing the phenomena, while fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts and algorithms into the network's nodes provide those nodes with the ability to mimics the human behavior in sensing and reacting which give the network the ability to be autonomous for a specific application. This paper presents the fusion of artificial intelligence represented by Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) with WSAN for greenhouse climate control. Smartness of current WSAN (SWSAN) is proposed based on FIS while the conventional control methods are not efficient in terms of energy, labor interference, productivity and flexibility. In this paper, Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) has been designed and fused within the coordinator node of WSAN, and hardware and software of network nodes and sensors have been presented. Indeed, this paper describes the new era of cognitive WSAN based on AI paradigm and shows a reprehensive set of new applications and identifies several possibilities of creating the smartness concepts of currently Wireless Sensor-Actor Network (WSAN).

This framework shares some of the key behavioral aspects of the biological brain, such as spiking neurons, neuroplasticity, neuronal pruning, and excitatory and inhibitory interactions between neurons, together making it capable of learning and memorizing. One of the highlights of the proposed design is its potential to incrementally improve itself over generations based on system performance, using genetic algorithms.

Therefore, Human Reliability Analysis and Dynamic Decision-Making Styles (DDMSs) play an important role in safety management in these industries. This study employs the intelligent Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System model associated with two questionnaires along with Cognitive Reliability Error Analysis Method to analyze the Human Reliability Influencing Factors (HRIFs) and DDMSs of the control room operators and to determine the efficiency of operators as well as their dominant and efficient decision-making styles. Nine influencing factors on human reliability and five DDMSs are evaluated and the correlation between the HRIFs is investigated. Efficiency of the operators, according to the HRIFs, is determined and they are ranked. Next, the most dominant and efficient of the DDMSs among the operators was identified.

This research aims to find out the explanation needs for a user role called model manager, a user monitoring multiple AI-based systems for quality assurance in manufacturing. The question this research attempts to answer is what are the explainability needs of the model manager. By using a design analysis technique (task questions), a concept (UI mockup) was created in a controlled way. Additionally, a causal chain model was created and used as an assumed representation of the mental model for explanations. Furthermore, several options of confidence levels were explored. In a qualitative user study (cognitive walkthrough) with ten participants, it was investigated which explanations are needed to support understandability, trustworthiness, and actionability. The research concludes four findings: F1) A mental model for explanations is an effective way to identify uncertainty addressing explanation content that addresses target user group specific needs.

Enhancing the efficacy of human-robot handovers involves enabling robots to comprehend and foresee human handover intentions. This article introduces human-teaching-robot-learning-prediction framework, allowing robots to learn from diverse human demonstrations and anticipate human handover intentions. The framework facilitates human programming of robots through demonstrations utilizing augmented reality and a wearable dataglove, aligned with task requirements and human working preferences. Subsequently, robots enhance their cognitive capabilities by assimilating insights from human handover demonstrations, utilizing deep neural network algorithms. Furthermore, robots can proactively seek clarification from humans via an augmented reality system when confronted with ambiguity in human intentions, mirroring how humans seek clarity from their counterparts. This proactive approach empowers robots to anticipate human intentions and assist human partners during handovers. Empirical results underscore the benefits of the proposed approach, demonstrating highly accurate prediction of human intentions in human-robot handover tasks. A novel human-teaching-robot-learning-prediction framework is presented in this paper. Using the proposed framework, the human can teach the robot through multimodal demonstrations. The robot can learn from human demonstrations and predict human handover intentions using the learned prediction model.

Specifically, prior research repeatedly indicates that decision-makers often refuse to adopt the data-driven, system-generated advice in their working procedures. In this paper, we address these acceptance issues by studying how PdM implementation changes the nature of decision-makers' work and how these changes affect their acceptance of PdM systems. We build on the human-centric Smith-Carayon Work System model to synthesise literature from research areas where system acceptance has been explored in more detail. Consequently, we expand the maintenance literature by investigating the human-, task-, and organisational characteristics of PdM implementation. Following the literature review, we distil ten propositions regarding decision-making behaviour in PdM settings. Next, we verify each proposition's relevance through in-depth interviews with experts from both academia and industry. Based on the propositions and interviews, we identify four factors that facilitate PdM adoption: trust between decision-maker and model (maker), control in the decision-making process, availability of sufficient cognitive resources, and proper organisational allocation of decision-making. Our results contribute to a fundamental understanding of acceptance behaviour in a PdM context and provide recommendations to increase the effectiveness of PdM implementations.","[van Oudenhoven, Bas; van de Calseyde, Philippe; Basten, Rob; Demerouti, Evangelia] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology,"van Oudenhoven, B (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",b.v.oudenhoven@tue.nl,"Demerouti, E/AAD-1334-2019","Basten, Rob/0000-0003-4562-9681; van Oudenhoven, Bas/0000-0002-5808-9023",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO); [NWA.1160.18.238],Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO));,This research is funded by Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) Grant number NWA.1160.18.238.,,135,19,20,5,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a feasible technique to identify their abnormal states to enhance the reliability of human-cybernetics systems. With the advancement of deep learning in physiological modeling, a model for evaluating operators' performance driven by electrocardiogram (ECG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was proposed, demonstrating high ecological validity. The model fused a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a graph attention network (GAT) backbone to extract discriminative features from ECG time-frequency spectrums and fNIRS prefrontal cortex (PFC) network respectively with deeper neuroscience domain knowledge, and eventually achieved 0.90 AUC. Results supported that handcrafted features extracted by specialized neuroscience methods can alleviate overfitting. Inspired by the small-world nature of the brain network, the fNIRS PFC network was organized as an undirected graph and embedded by GAT. It is proven to perform better in information aggregation and delivery compared to a simple non-linear transformation. The model provides a potential neuroergonomics application to evaluate the human state in vital human-cybernetics systems under industry 5.0 scenarios.","[Jia, Ming; Xu, Zhihui] China Nucl Power Engn Co Ltd, State Key Lab Nucl Power Safety Technol & Equipmen, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan; Chen, Tao; Li, Meng; Wang, Jianyu; Hu, Xiangmin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Safety Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tao] Anhui Prov Key Lab Human Safety, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tao] Beijing Key Lab Comprehens Emergency Response Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Nuclear Power Engineering Co Ltd.; Tsinghua University,"Xu, ZH (corresponding author), China Nucl Power Engn Co Ltd, State Key Lab Nucl Power Safety Technol & Equipmen, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chentao.a@tsinghua.edu.cn; xuzhihui@hrbeu.edu.cn,,"zhang, yan/0000-0002-8573-0111","State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Power Safety Technology and Equipment, China Nuclear Power Engi-neering Co., Ltd.

However, human performance during task execution may vary. To ensure high human-robot teaming (HRT) performance, it is crucial to predict performance without negatively affecting task execution. Therefore, to predict performance indirectly, significant factors affecting human performance, such as engagement and task load (i.e., amount of cognitive, physical, and/or sensory resources required to perform a particular task), must be considered. Hence, we propose a framework to predict and maximize the HRT performance. For the prediction of task performance during the development phase, our methodology employs features extracted from physiological data as inputs. The labels for these predictions-categorized as accurate performance or inaccurate performance due to high/low task load-are meticulously crafted using a combination of the NASA TLX questionnaire, records of human performance in quality control tasks, and the application of Q-Learning to derive task-specific weights for the task load indices. This structured approach enables the deployment of our model to exclusively rely on physiological data for predicting performance, thereby achieving an accuracy rate of 95.45% in forecasting HRT performance. To maintain optimized HRT performance, this study further introduces a method of dynamically adjusting the robot's speed in the case of low performance. This strategic adjustment is designed to effectively balance the task load, thereby enhancing the efficiency of human-robot collaboration.","[Korivand, Soroush; Jalili, Nader] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Dallas, TX 75205 USA; [Galvani, Gustavo] Univ Alabama, Dept Mech Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Ajoudani, Arash] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Human Robot Interfaces & Phys Interact Lab HRI2, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Gong, Jiaqi] Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Southern Methodist University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Jalili, N (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Dallas, TX 75205 USA.;Gong, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",skorivand@smu.edu; gmartinsgalvani@crimson.ua.edu; arash.ajoudani@iit.it; jiaqi.gong@ua.edu; njalili@smu.edu,"Korivand, Soroush/ABA-6636-2021","Korivand, Soroush/0000-0001-7407-8159",,,,,46,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAY,2024,24,9,,,,,,,2817,10.3390/s24092817,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s24092817,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,QH6C6,38732923,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-15,WOS:001220016100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

If the pattern suggests that the user cannot follow the instructions or that the user is distracted, the complexity of the training system can be reduced.","[Fahimipirehgalin, Mina; Loch, Frieder; Vogel-Heuser, Birgit] Tech Univ Munich TUM, Automat & Informat Syst AIS, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Fahimipirehgalin, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich TUM, Automat & Informat Syst AIS, Munich, Germany.",Mina.Fahimi@tum.de; Frieder.Loch@tum.de; Vogel-heuser@tum.de,"Vogel-Heuser, Birgit/M-1585-2017",,INCLUSIVE collaborative project from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [72337],INCLUSIVE collaborative project from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme,"This work has been supported by the INCLUSIVE collaborative project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No. 72337.",,12,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-3-030-39512-4; 978-3-030-39511-7,ADV INTELL SYST COMP,,,2020,1131,,,,,,341,347,,10.1007/978-3-030-39512-4_54,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-39512-4_54,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BR3AZ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000643768600054,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to identify risky individuals among the company workers, a multimethod approach with behavioral, cognitive, psychometric, and implicit measures has been utilized. Over hundred volunteers reported on life facts associated with risk propensity and underwent multimethod assessment. Results indicated that measures from all four groups of methods were able to reliably identify risky individuals.

By considering factors related to Kansei and applying them to the product development and design process, user experience can be improved. To evaluate Kansei quantitatively, researchers used questionnaires such as self-assessment manikin (SAM) in the past years. Recently, researchers have measured physiological signals associated with a person's emotional state, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV), to evaluate Kansei more objectively. Furthermore, previous studies have proposed a method to estimate emotions using EEG and HRV. They combined these two signals to estimate emotions based on a psychological model, Russell's circumplex model. In order to distinguish inferred emotions based on physiological signals from cognitive emotions, they named their method the bio-emotion estimation method. However, the accuracy of bio-emotion estimation method has not been fully validated. Meanwhile, the traditional SAM questionnaire can obtain users' cognitive emotions with arousal and valence value. The arousal and valence also correspond to the two factors of the bio-emotion estimation method. Therefore, we conducted a SAM questionnaire to verify the accuracy of the bio-emotion estimation method. The results showed that the measured EEG indexes were highly consistent with human arousal perception. Then, we applied the bio-emotion estimation method to present the emotional transitions induced by the stimuli.","[Feng, Chen; Sugaya, Midori] Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tokyo, Japan; [Sripian, Peeraya; Tazawa, Toshiaki] Shibaura Inst Technol, Innovat Global Program, Tokyo, Japan; [Tazawa, Toshiaki; Sakai, Saaya] S T Corp, Res & Dev Div, Tokyo, Japan",Shibaura Institute of Technology; Shibaura Institute of Technology,"Feng, C (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tokyo, Japan.",nb18109@shibaura-it.ac.jp; peeraya@shibaura-it.ac.jp; tipporn@shibaura-it.ac.jp; t-tazawa@st-c.co.jp; s-sakai@st-c.co.jp; doly@shibaura-it.ac.jp,"feng, chen/JLM-8296-2023; Sripian, Peeraya/G-4514-2019","Sripian, Peeraya/0000-0002-8753-734X",,,,,15,0,0,2,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-5490-2,,,,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/ACIIW57231.2022.10086000,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACIIW57231.2022.10086000,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BV1CP,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000984528700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is therefore crucial to improve individuals' performance and alertness in sensitive places like industries' control room with the ultimate goal of increasing efficiency and reducing the number of possible incidents. Previous research has indicated that blue light is a critical cue for entraining circadian rhythm. As a result, the present study was an attempt to investigate whether blue-enriched white light illumination was a practical strategy to decrease sleepiness and improve cognitive performance during night shifts. Martial and methods: The study, which adopted a before-after interventional design, was conducted among 30 control room staff members of petrochemical industry. After baseline assessments under existing lighting conditions, every participant was exposed to two new lighting conditions (namely, 17,000 K and 6500 K blue enriched white light), each lasting for a week. Assessments were conducted again at the end of these treatments. In order to measure the subjective sleepiness, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) was utilized. Subjects also performed the Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) and 1-back test in order to gauge their cognitive performance, and melatonin assessment was carried out using salivary and Eliza technique. The data was analyzed using two-way repeated measure ANOVA. Results: The results indicated that, compared to normal lighting conditions, participants' sleepiness and melatonin rhythm significantly declined when they were exposed to blue-enriched white light. Furthermore, the experimental condition had a significant effect on the reduction of working memory errors. It also decreased omission errors and the reaction time during the sustained attention task. Conclusions: Thus, using blue-enriched white light may be a proper ergonomic strategy for improving performance and alertness, especially during night, in sensitive environments like control rooms.","[Motamedzadeh, Majid; Heidarimoghadam, Rashid] Hamedan Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Ergon, Hamadan, Iran; [Golmohammadi, Rostam] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Occupat Hyg, Hamadan, Iran; [Kazemi, Reza] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Ergon, Shiraz, Iran",Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Shiraz University of Medical Science,"Kazemi, R (corresponding author), POB 71645-111, Shiraz, Iran.",motamedzade@yahoo.com; rezakazemi2007@gmail.com; Dr_haidari@yahoo.com,"heidarimoghadam, Rashid/I-6257-2018; Motamedzade, Majid/I-7991-2012; kazemi, reza/P-3543-2017","heidarimoghadam, Rashid/0000-0002-5711-0150; Motamedzade, Majid/0000-0001-8545-5845; kazemi, reza/0000-0003-1361-7360",Hamadan University of Medical Sciences,Hamadan University of Medical Sciences(Hamadan University of Medical Sciences),"This study was supported by Hamadan University of Medical Sciences and was conducted in partnership with the National Petrochemical Company.

To build the model, a driving scenario was first identified based on the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) driving route. The driving model was created using IMPRINT, a discrete event simulation tool that characterizes four classes of human resources that may contribute to driver workload: visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor (VACP). For this initial model we tested limited number and type of distractions. The initial use of a sample of driver aids and their importance to mitigating driver distractions has also been included. Relevance to Industry: This study investigated the use of a driver workload simulation model to provide commercial vehicle interface designers a tool to investigate the impact of the multiple activities an operator performs while driving. A simulation model can predict the changes in driver workload due to multiple secondary tasks performed in varying driving conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes methods and processes for creating experiential learning cases, which result in more adaptive behaviors, more effective performance and more sustainable results among small unit leaders.

Especially for AI systems, increasing knowledge-bases for elaborate computations lead to a lower efficiency of their inference mechanisms. In contrast to AI, bounded cognitive capacity is a well-known problem in psychology. When humans receive too much information, a state of information overload emerges. In order to cope with limited capacity and prevent information overload, humans adapt their knowledge and delete, override, suppress, or sort out outdated information, i.e., they forget. By transferring theories from human cognition to multiagent systems, the AdaptPRO project adopts intentional forgetting as a strategy for coping with information overload in both human and multiagent teams. This article gives an overview of an interdisciplinary research project with a strong focus on knowledge distributions and knowledge dynamics from a distributed AI perspective. Its core contribution is a formal model for distributing and adapting (meta-) knowledge by intentional forgetting to enable efficient and resilient teamwork.","[Reuter, Lukas; Berndt, Jan Ole; Timm, Ingo J.] Trier Univ, Trier Res Lab Simulat TriLabS, Ctr Informat Res & Technol CIRT, Behringstr 21, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Ulfert, Anna-Sophie; Antoni, Conny H.; Ellwart, Thomas] Trier Univ, Business Work & Org Psychol, Univ Ring 15, D-54296 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier; Universitat Trier,"Reuter, L (corresponding author), Trier Univ, Trier Res Lab Simulat TriLabS, Ctr Informat Res & Technol CIRT, Behringstr 21, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",reuter@uni-trier.de; berndt@uni-trier.de; ulfert@uni-trier.de; antoni@uni-trier.de; ellwart@uni-trier.de; itimm@uni-trier.de,"Ulfert-Blank, Anna-Sophie/ABQ-2049-2022; Antoni, Conny/AAG-3898-2020","Berndt, Jan Ole/0000-0001-7241-3291; Ulfert-Blank, Anna-Sophie/0000-0001-6293-4173; Antoni, Conny/0000-0003-0635-825X; Ellwart, Thomas/0000-0003-3726-1346","German Research Foundation (DFG) [TI 548/-1, SPP 1921]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The project AdaptPRO: Adaptive Process and Role Design in Organizations (TI 548/-1) is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Priority Program Intentional Forgetting in Organizations (SPP 1921).,,35,2,2,2,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0933-1875,1610-1987,,KUNSTL INTELL,Kunstl.

Inspired by the evolution of the human brain, this paper demonstrates a novel method and framework to synthesize an artificial brain with cognitive abilities by taking advantage of the same process responsible for the growth of the biological brain called neuroembryogenesis. This framework shares some of the key behavioral aspects of the biological brain such as spiking neurons, neuroplasticity, neuronal pruning, and excitatory and inhibitory interactions between neurons, together making it capable of learning and memorizing. One of the highlights of the proposed design is its potential to incrementally improve itself over generations based on system performance, using genetic algorithms. A proof of concept at the end of the paper demonstrates how a simplified implementation of the human visual cortex using the proposed framework is capable of character recognition.

Robotics has developed well as an industrial topic, based on mechatronics. In the context of medical robotics, such a connection is now strongly appearing. The connecting link is given through the physical manmachine interface, i.e. force feedback or, more generally, haptic interface. It is now generally accepted that the strict division of the cognitive, mental activities from the physical (mechanical) world is not feasible. On the contrary, the two aspects are more closely linked than previously suspected, embodiment is an important keyword in this context. This new paradigm from neurosciences has practical consequences for human-robot interfaces and opens up new fields of experimental studies with promising perspectives. Specifically, we will discuss haptic telemanipulator interfaces and robotic rehabilitation devices. Some research projects at the intersection of robotics, cognitive neurosciences and rehabilitations will be very briefly presented.","[Bleuler, H.; Bouri, M.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Robot Syst Lab LSRO, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Bleuler, H (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Robot Syst Lab LSRO, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",hannes.bleuler@epfl.ch,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2211-0984,2211-0992,978-3-319-01591-0; 978-3-319-01592-7,MECH MACH SCI,,,2014,16,,,,,,1,10,,10.1007/978-3-319-01592-7_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-01592-7_1,10.1007/978-3-319-01592-7,,10,"Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Mechanical",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Engineering,BB5RT,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000344057400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, the transition process of I4.0 can be considered a critical decision-making problem. Since the process consists of a wide range of impact areas, such as employees, workers, environment, and society, it should be considered in a multi-way perspective to obtain an acceptable roadmap. By minimizing the loss of information, this paper proposes a fuzzy methodology, DEMATEL, Cognitive Mapping (CM), and TOPSIS techniques, to analyse the sectoral prioritization of the I4.0 transition. The DEMATEL method is applied to identify the dependencies of the criteria. The criterion 'Suitability of technological infrastructure' is determined as the most effective one. The CM method is used to determine the weight of the criteria, in which 'Technological Infrastructure Suitability', and 'Digitalization Level of Processes' is the most important ones, respectively. Considered sectors are also prioritized by using the TOPSIS method. Finally, comparison and sensitivity analyses are performed for discussions on the transition process and possible outcomes.","[Kaya, Ihsan; Karasan, Ali; Ilbahar, Esra] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Kaya, Ihsan] Def Ind Agcy, Presidency Republ Turkiye, Ankara, Turkiye; [Cebeci, Beyza] Baykar Def Co, Dept Project Improvement, Istanbul, Turkiye",Yildiz Technical University,"Kaya, I (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkiye.",ihkaya@yildiz.edu.tr,"Ilbahar, Esra/ABA-1833-2020; Karaşan, Ali/U-3966-2017",,The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Trkiye [120K051],The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Trkiye,This study is supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkiye (TUBITAK) under Project Number 120K051.,,117,1,1,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

This diversity and growing use are boosting research and leading to an increasing number of XR experiments involving human subjects. The main aim of these studies is to understand the user experience in the broadest sense, such as the user cognitive and emotional states. Behavioral data collected during XR experiments, such as user movements, gaze, actions, and physiological signals constitute precious assets for analyzing and understanding the user experience. While they contribute to overcome the intrinsic flaws of explicit data such as post-experiment questionnaires, the required acquisition and analysis tools are costly and challenging to develop, especially for 6DoF (Degrees of Freedom) XR experiments. Moreover, there is no common format for XR behavioral data, which restrains data-sharing, and thus hinders wide usages across the community, replicability of studies, and the constitution of large datasets or meta-analysis. In this context, we present PLUME, an open-source software toolbox (PLUME Recorder, PLUME Viewer, PLUME Python) that allows for the exhaustive record of XR behavioral data (including synchronous physiological signals), their offline interactive replay and analysis (with a standalone application), and their easy sharing due to our compact and interoperable data format. We believe that PLUME can greatly benefit the scientific community by making the use of behavioral and physiological data available for the greatest, contributing to the reproducibility and replicability of XR user studies, enabling the creation of large datasets, and contributing to a deeper understanding of user experience.","[Javerliat, Charles; Villenave, Sophie; Raimbaud, Pierre; Lavoue, Guillaume] Ecole Cent Lyon, CNRS, ENISE, LIRIS UMR5025, Ecully, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Centrale de Lyon,"Javerliat, C (corresponding author), Ecole Cent Lyon, CNRS, ENISE, LIRIS UMR5025, Ecully, France.",charles.javerliat@ec-lyon.fr; sophie.villenave@ec-lyon.fr; pierre.raimbaud.pr@gmail.com; guillaume.lavoue@enise.ec-lyon.fr,"Raimbaud, Pierre/KDM-8260-2024","Villenave, Sophie/0000-0002-6152-9800; Javerliat, Charles/0000-0003-0748-5541; Raimbaud, Pierre/0000-0002-5584-8100",French National Research Agency as part of the RENFORCE,French National Research Agency as part of the RENFORCE(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),No Statement Available,,80,1,1,0,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1077-2626,1941-0506,,IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR,IEEE Trans.

Various systems have been developed to make automated driving possible. Due to the algorithm used in the autonomous vehicle system, the performance of the vehicle differs from one to another. However, very few studies have given insight into the influence caused by implementing different algorithms from a human factors point of view. Two systems based on two algorithms with different characteristics are utilized to generate the two driving styles of the autonomous vehicle, which are implemented into a driving simulator in order to create the autonomous driving experience. User's skin conductance (SC) data, which enables the evaluation of user's cognitive workload and mental stress were recorded and analyzed. Subjective measures were applied by filling out Swedish occupational fatigue inventory (SOFI-20) to get a user self-reporting perspective view of their behavior changes along with the experiments. The results showed that human's states were affected by the driving styles of different autonomous systems, especially in the period of speed variation. By analyzing users' self-assessment data, a correlation was observed between the user Sleepiness and the driving style of the autonomous vehicle. These results would be meaningful for the future development of the autonomous vehicle systems, in terms of balancing the performance of the vehicle and user's experience.","[Shi, Yuan; Huang, Wenhui; Cheli, Federico; Bordegoni, Monica; Caruso, Giandomenico] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Shi, Y (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy.",yuan.shi@polimi.it,"Caruso, Giandomenico/A-1694-2016; Huang, Wenhui/GPL-6227-2022","Caruso, Giandomenico/0000-0003-2654-093X; Huang, Wenhui/0000-0001-7212-027X",China Scholarship Council,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This research was supported by the i.Drive Lab (Interaction of Driver, Road, Infrastructure, Vehicle, and Environment - Politecnico di Milano - http://www.idrive.polimi.it/).

Human behaviour in this domain offers a fertile ground for studying decision-making and identifying opportunities for improvement. This research sought to improve the quality of decision-making by developing an aide memoire for managing cognitive biases in emergency management. Based on the appropriate literature, 58 of Australia's leading marine spill disaster response experts identified and ranked the most important cognitive biases in a group setting. The results were translated into language relevant to emergency management practitioners and reframed into a series of questions. The identification of nine cognitive biases in the aide memoire can first be used to assess the available information, intelligence and decisions, and then used to determine the meaning of the information, intelligence and decisions. The paper discusses the applicability of the aide memoire to decision errors identified in recent man-made and natural disasters.

Recent work has suggested that the emergence of collaboration frequently relies on geographic proximity. However, being co-located tends to be associated with other dimensions of proximity, such as social ties or a shared organizational environment. To account for such factors, multiple dimensions of proximity have been proposed, including cognitive, institutional, organizational, social and geographical proximity. Since they strongly interrelate, disentangling these dimensions and their respective impact on collaboration is challenging. To address this issue, we propose various methods for measuring different dimensions of proximity. We then present an approach to compare and rank them with respect to the extent to which they indicate co-publications and co-inventions. We adapt the HypTrails approach, which was originally developed to explain human navigation, to co-author and co-inventor graphs. We evaluate this approach on a subset of the German research community, specifically academic authors and inventors active in research on artificial intelligence (AI). We find that social proximity and cognitive proximity are more important for the emergence of collaboration than geographic proximity.","[Koopmann, Tobias; Hotho, Andreas] Univ Wurzburg, Data Sci Chair, Wurzburg, Germany; [Stubbemann, Maximilian; Jaeschke, Robert; Stumme, Gerd] L3S Res Ctr, Hannover, Germany; [Kapa, Matthias; Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, INCHER, Kassel, Germany; [Kapa, Matthias; Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Kassel, Inst Econ, Kassel, Germany; [Paris, Michael; Jaeschke, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Buenstorf, Guido] Univ Gothenburg, Innovat & Entrepreneurship Unit, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Hanika, Tom] Univ Kassel, Knowledge & Data Engn Grp, Kassel, Germany",University of Wurzburg; Leibniz University Hannover; Universitat Kassel; Universitat Kassel; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Gothenburg; Universitat Kassel,"Koopmann, T (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Data Sci Chair, Wurzburg, Germany.",koopmann@informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de; stubbemann@13s.de; kapa@incher.uni-kassel.de; michael.paris@hu-berlin.de; buenstorf@uni-kassel.de; hanika@cs.uni-kassel.de; hotho@informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de; robert.jaeschke@hu-berlin.de; stumme@13s.de,"Koopmann, Tobias/JKJ-5457-2023; Stumme, Gerd/AAR-1955-2020","Hanika, Tom/0000-0002-4918-6374; Paris, Michael/0000-0003-2077-6984; Koopmann, Tobias/0000-0002-7736-9864",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(BMBF) [01PU17012A-D],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The investigation is based on a thematic analysis of the interviews of twelve RA practitioners. The analysis identified an overarching theme supporting the view that the team approach is the one true remedy to RA process shortcomings as well as five other themes: (1) the value of the human influence in RA; (2) transnationalism - an unfathomable notion; (3) consistency is no panacea to performance; (4) CI organizational RA-influencing forces; and (5) CI RA-enablers and impediments. The investigation suggests that the team approach to effective RA for CIP is considered as the absolute panacea in the eyes of practitioners although both insights from the current industry RA practice through the interviews themselves, and an investigation of relevant literature suggests that although this is warmheartedly recommended (a) there are no set rules and guidelines in its application, (b) it is not coordinated nor applied consistently, and (c) it is not an integral part of RA processes. Notwithstanding the reality that a team approach to RA for CIP is being contemplated by practitioners, albeit with lagging consistency and coordination, it is evident that additional research is necessary to broaden the understanding of its value.","[Papamichael, Michalis] European Univ Cyprus, Occupat Safety & Hlth, POB 42304, Larnax 6533, Cyprus; [Dimopoulos, Christos; Boustras, Georgios] European Univ Cyprus, Ctr Res Decis Sci CERIDES, Phileleftheros Bldg,1 Diogenous Str,3rd Floor, CY-2404 Egkomi, Cyprus; [Vryonides, Marios] European Univ Cyprus, 6 Diogenous Str, CY-2404 Nicosia, Cyprus",European University Cyprus; European University Cyprus; European University Cyprus,"Papamichael, M (corresponding author), European Univ Cyprus, Occupat Safety & Hlth, POB 42304, Larnax 6533, Cyprus.",michalis1002@outlook.com,"Boustras, Georgios/H-6165-2013","Papamichael, Michalis/0009-0003-1085-291X; Dimopoulos, Christos/0000-0002-1610-7772",,,,,129,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1874-5482,2212-2087,,INT J CRIT INFR PROT,Int.

The study focused on the situation when operators with no programming skills have to accomplish teleoperated tasks dealing with randomly localized different-sized objects in an unstructured environment. The purpose of this study is to reduce stress on operators, increase accuracy and reduce the time of task accomplishment. The special application of the proposed system is in the radioactive isotope production factories. The following approach combined the reactivity of the operator's direct control with the powerful tools of vision-based object classification and localization. Design/methodology/approachPerceptive real-time gesture control predicated on a Kinect sensor is formulated by information fusion between human intuitiveness and an augmented reality-based vision algorithm. Objects are localized using a developed feature-based vision algorithm, where the homography is estimated and Perspective-n-Point problem is solved. The 3D object position and orientation are stored in the robot end-effector memory for the last mission adjusting and waiting for a gesture control signal to autonomously pick/place an object. Object classification process is done using a one-shot Siamese neural network (NN) to train a proposed deep NN; other well-known models are also used in a comparison. The system was contextualized in one of the nuclear industry applications: radioactive isotope production and its validation were performed through a user study where 10 participants of different backgrounds are involved. FindingsThe system was contextualized in one of the nuclear industry applications: radioactive isotope production and its validation were performed through a user study where 10 participants of different backgrounds are involved. The results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed teleoperation system and demonstrate its potential for use by robotics non-experienced users to effectively accomplish remote robot tasks. Social implicationsThe proposed system reduces risk and increases level of safety when applied in hazardous environment such as the nuclear one. Originality/valueThe contribution and uniqueness of the presented study are represented in the development of a well-integrated HRI system that can tackle the four aforementioned circumstances in an effective and user-friendly way. High operator-robot reactivity is kept by using the direct control method, while a lot of cognitive stress is removed using elective/flapped autonomous mode to manipulate randomly localized different configuration objects. This necessitates building an effective deep learning algorithm (in comparison to well-known methods) to recognize objects in different conditions: illumination levels, shadows and different postures.","[Salman, Ahmed Eslam] Egyptian Atom Energy Author, Radiat Engn Dept NCRRT, Cairo, Egypt; [Roman, Magdy Raouf] Helwan Univ, Fac Engn, Mech Power Engn Dept, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority (EAEA); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Helwan University,"Salman, AE (corresponding author), Egyptian Atom Energy Author, Radiat Engn Dept NCRRT, Cairo, Egypt.",eng.ahmed8810@yahoo.com; magdy_roman@m-eng.helwan.edu.eg,"Solyman, Ahmed/Q-9140-2019","Salman, Ahmed Eslam/0000-0002-5979-8526",,,,,65,4,4,4,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-991X,1758-5791,,IND ROBOT,Ind.

Data visualization is among the most powerful tools in the data analyst's arsenal, enabling the transformation of data into effective visualizations that can be easily comprehended. However, its effectiveness is often affected by the data analysts' experience and their ability to quickly understand and interpret information. Even though business analytics tools have made a significant progress to deliver immersive data visualization environments for improving users' efficiency and effectiveness, they still do not consider the individual differences in the core process that influences the visualization structure, encoding, and readability. This paper leverages the users' individual differences to deliver a novel human-centered by-design adaptation engine for business users. The adaptation engine aims to improve the comprehension of data visualizations by delivering personalized content (visualization type and adaptation of visual elements), which in turn leads to improved accuracy and time-to-action efficiency. The proposed adaptation mechanism is evaluated using 45 professional business analysts from multiple industry sectors. The results suggest that individual differences can play an important role in the adaptation process of data visualizations enhancing analysts' comprehensibility and decision making.","[Andreou, Panayiotis; Amyrotos, Christos; Polycarpou, Irene] UCLan Cyprus, InSPIRE, Larnaka, Cyprus; [Germanakos, Panagiotis] SAP SE, InSPIRE, Waldorf, Germany",,"Andreou, P (corresponding author), UCLan Cyprus, InSPIRE, Larnaka, Cyprus.",pgandreou@uclan.ac.uk; amyrotos@gmail.com; panagiotis.germanakos@sap.com; ipolycarpou@uclan.ac.uk,,"Andreou, Panayiotis/0000-0002-6369-1094; GERMANAKOS, PANAGIOTIS/0000-0001-7147-0956; Amyrotos, Christos/0000-0001-9860-0407",Cyprus RIF [EXCELLENCE/0918/0366]; European Union [101008468],Cyprus RIF; European Union(European Union (EU)),This research was partially funded by the Cyprus RIF under the project IDEALVis (EXCELLENCE/0918/0366) and the European Union under the project SLICES-PP (No. 101008468).,,39,1,1,0,3,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-9932-6,,,,2023,,,,,,,25,33,,10.1145/3565472.3592961,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3565472.3592961,,,9,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BV5PQ,,"Bronze, Green Accepted",,,2024-11-15,WOS:001051715400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, in order to solve the fuzziness and uncertainty of preference information in the matching process of complex product manufacturing tasks on the cloud manufacturing platform, a novel two-sided matching model based on dual hesitant fuzzy preference information is proposed. Firstly, the two-sided matching problem and the dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) are described. Then, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is constructed and normalized according to the preference information provided by agents on both sides. Sequentially, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is transformed into the satisfaction degree matrix by the projection technology. Simultaneously, considering the stable matching constraint, a multi-objective two-sided matching optimization model which maximizes the satisfaction degree and minimizes the difference degree of two-sided agents is established. Further, the matching relative competition degree is used to convert the multi-objective optimization model into a single-objective optimization model, and the matching algorithm is designed for solving the model. Moreover, an illustrative example is employed to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the developed model. Subsequently, the sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the stability of the proposed matching results, and the comparative analysis is carried out to illustrate the reliability of the proposed matching algorithm and the merits of the developed model. It reveals that the proposed model can not only obtain stable matching results but also give more choices in matching methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The architecture of this system consists of multiple controllers which handle the uni-axial motion. Then, the hardware components and their connections are described in detail so that each controller can be associated with the others. Later, the software design included a mutual interface, data flow, computational algorithms, and state machine. The practical platform has been developed that realizes several motion profiles, delivering smooth performance and advanced results. Different laboratory tests have been completed for the validations of our approach. In each context, the motion performance of the proposed method is achieved and analyzed. These results show that our approach is practical, feasible, and proper for various contexts in human-robot collaboration for Industry 4.0.","[Phan, Dang Quy; Ngo, Ha Quang Thinh] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol HCMUT, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mechatron, 268 Ly Thuong Kiet St, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam; [Phan, Dang Quy; Ngo, Ha Quang Thinh] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Thu Duc City, Vietnam",Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT); Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,"Ngo, HT (corresponding author), Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol HCMUT, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Mechatron, 268 Ly Thuong Kiet St, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.;Ngo, HT (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City VNU HCM, Thu Duc City, Vietnam.",nhqthinh@hcmut.edu.vn,"Phan Dang, Quy/KBQ-4283-2024; Ngo, Ha Quang Thinh/I-1609-2018","Ngo, Ha Quang Thinh/0000-0002-7898-1107; Phan Dang, Quy/0000-0001-6360-6446","Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT~, VNU-HCM","Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT~, VNU-HCM","We acknowledge Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT & nbsp;, VNU-HCM for supporting this study.& nbsp;",,40,2,2,15,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2543-1536,2542-6605,,INTERNET THINGS-NETH,Internet Things,JUL,2023,22,,,,,,,,100788,10.1016/j.iot.2023.100788,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iot.2023.100788,,MAY 2023,22,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,Q1AV0,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001054920800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The CLO3D technology is used to realize the three-dimensional design and virtual performance of clothing. Aiming at the cognitive differences between designers and consumers in fashion design, an explorative research was done based on the consumers' perceptual cognition of clothing, which suggested an evaluation method for clothing based on perceptual image and established a perceptual cognition matching model between customers and designers. With the methods of expert interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, card classification, four evaluation dimensions of clothing design were extracted: overall style, appearance style, color&fabric, pressure perception and 11 corresponding evaluation factors. Taking business men's wear as an example, an evaluation factor knowledge base and a general computer-aided clothing design emotional image evaluation system are constructed. Based on this system, consumers can get a new experience of immersive virtual fitting, and designers can quickly get consumers' evaluation of clothing design to improve efficiency of clothing design.","[Zhang, Yufei; Luo, Shijian; Cui, Zhitong; Bian, Ze; Shan, Ping] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Ind Design, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Zhang, YF (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Ind Design, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.",634906847@qq.com; sjluo@126.com; 359243864@qq.com; 403191990@qq.com,"Zhang, yufei/HHC-7375-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51675476, 51175458]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51675476 and No. 51175458).,,24,4,4,5,48,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-3-030-20441-9; 978-3-030-20440-2,ADV INTELL SYST COMP,,,2020,952,,,,,,418,429,,10.1007/978-3-030-20441-9_44,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20441-9_44,,,12,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BR4IO,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000651439600044,View Full Record in Web of Science

The specific research context was intelligent vehicles, a common form of automation and AI. Findings showed that anthropomorphism can significantly boost user self-accountability for both successes and failures, while hierarchical status primarily affected accountability for failures. Besides, the positive effects of anthropomorphism on self-accountability and use intention were mediated by cognitive empowerment and social rewards, respectively. This study also found that educational background amplified the impact of anthropomorphism, whereas ethnic differences moderated the effects of hierarchical status on self-accountability. Furthermore, incident experiences were found to positively moderate the relationship between hierarchical status and use intention, which indicates the need for more safety-focused strategies for human-computer interaction (HCI). In general, this study presented a promising strategy for academia and industry in designing human-like interactions to balance self-serving bias and foster self-accountability, which can potentially result in more inclusive and effective HCI experiences.","[Wu, Min; Li, Zhaotong; Yuen, Kum Fai] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Nanyang, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Yuen, KF (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Nanyang, Singapore.",kumfai.yuen@ntu.edu.sg,"Yuen, Kum/K-2994-2019; Yuen, Kum Fai/B-8244-2015","Yuen, Kum Fai/0000-0002-9199-6661; Wu, Min/0000-0003-4415-0273","National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Programme (AISG) [AISG3-GV-2023-015]","National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Programme (AISG)","This research/project is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore under its AI Singapore Programme (AISG Award No: AISG3-GV-2023-015).",,129,0,0,29,29,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0747-5632,1873-7692,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

The objective is to ensure systems are designed so as to optimise the human contribution to production and minimise potential for design-induced risks to health, personal or process safety or environmental performance (OGP, 2011). The ISO standard ISO 9241-210 (2010), Ergonomics of human-system interaction, requires that all new facilities projects apply the principles of Human Factors Engineering (HFE) during early design stages. In practice this means ensuring, as a minimum, that every new facilities project is screened in collaboration with the end users to identify whether there are any hotspots (risks, issues or opportunities) associated with the scope of the design project that justify further HFE activities. Further standards detail these activities, including physical and cognitive ergonomic assessments of the operator tasks, the equipment they will use to complete those tasks, and the environment in which they will be undertaken. However, the standards need to be generic enough so as to avoid being tailored to any specific design process; this in turns generates a need for more specific guidance on different processes and activities supporting a more holistic approach to guide Designers, Operators, Risk Assessors and Project Planners at design stage. This guidance should help stakeholders identify and recognise the value of Human Factors Engineering considerations to optimise and guide some of the solutions devised in the early stages. Such an approach should help avoid more costly intervention later on in the lifecycle of the product or plant being designed and the possibility of undesired events related to miss-conceived Human Machine Interactions. There is often a need to demonstrate that this small initial investment in engineering to consider Human Factors aspects can result in a major reduction in the operational life-cycle costs and improvement in the conditions at work. However, this is often only demonstrated retrospectively after minor or major accidents. Strong operational performance can only start with good design and an understanding of what constitutes good design requires a detailed knowledge of how humans interact within the work system. The problem is whether the currently available standards and guidelines of the process industry provide sufficient guidance for a framework to be practically used by process engineers, discipline engineers, human factors engineers, ergonomists, project management and operational/maintenance line management during decisions to be made in preparation and execution of projects? This paper will start by observing and analysing the problem and presenting examples. The study will be continued by discussing what is currently available and performing a small gap analysis against concrete needs of case studies taken from the industry. Addressing those gaps will be within the scope of future research.","[Naghdali, Farzad; Leva, M.

Therefore, research exploring human error during maintenance activities is important. This article aims to assess the probability of human error in maintenance tasks at a cement factory using the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method and System Dynamics modeling. Given that human error probability (HEP) is influenced by various common performance conditions (CPCs) and their sub-factors, and changes dynamically in response to other variables, the SD method offers a practical approach for estimating and predicting human error behavior over time. This study identifies and quantifies the variables affecting HEP, explores their interactions and feedback in maintenance tasks, and assesses the associated costs. The machine learning technique is then used to estimate the relationship between HEP and these costs. The optimal value of the HEP function, 0.000772, is determined by identifying the minimum point of a cubic function, thereby minimizing associated costs and occupational accidents. Determining the optimal HEP is crucial for minimizing excessive costs and investing in improved ergonomics and CPCs for better performance. This addresses a significant gap in existing research where the impact of human error on maintenance tasks has not been estimated as a function. Furthermore, three scenarios are presented to help managers allocate the organization's budget more effectively.","[Emroozi, Vahideh Bafandegan; Kazemi, Mostafa; Pooya, Alireza] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Management, Mashhad, Iran; [Doostparast, Mahdi] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Math Sci, Dept Stat, Mashhad, Iran",Ferdowsi University Mashhad; Ferdowsi University Mashhad,"Kazemi, M (corresponding author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Management, Mashhad, Iran.",kazemi@um.ac.ir,"Bafandegan Emroozi, Vahideh/HWQ-5142-2023; Doostparast, Mahdi/K-2743-2017","Doostparast, Mahdi/0000-0002-4614-8137",,,,,78,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-8471,1520-6564,,HUM FACTOR ERGON MAN,Hum.

To better understand the critical processes of Cd-related health risks and to inform mitigation policies, an assessment method was integrated by coupling source-soil-rice-human systems with anthropogenic Cd sources historical survey, regional soil Cd concentration surveyed data and an extensive literature review of Cd related human diseases. This method was subsequently applied to a rapid developing industrial and agricultural area in China. Results indicated that Cd emission sources increased fourfold from 1990 to 2007, and remained high value about 140 x 10(3) kg yr(-1) after 2008 in the study region. The Cd fluxes in 1990-2017 varied from 3.93 to 73.49 mg m(-2). Raw coal consumption contributed to approximately 50% of total Cd fluxes. During 2003-2013, the annual increasing rate of soil Cd varied from -2.34 mu g kg(-1)yr(-1) to 7.94 mu g kg(-1)yr(-1) with an average 5.14 mu g kg(-1)yr(-1). Under the current industry and agriculture developing trends, farmland soil in 2030 will face significant Cd pollution risks and the average soil Cd concentration will increase to 0.35 mg kg(-1) which is 1.75 times higher than that of 2003. Consequently, higher Cd concentrations were predicted in rice grain and human blood. About 3.43% of adults may have obesity and hypertension, and approximately 4.96% of children will also be the risk of physical, cognitive neurobehavioral development. The mitigation strategies of Cd source reduction and phytoremediation technology in rice system can significantly decrease Cd-related health risks. These strategies are far less effective in already heavily polluted soils. This study provides critical information on Cd emission factors, Cd related human diseases, and a novel useful tool for policy-makers on metals pollution management.","[Deng, Meihua; Zhang, Qi] Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Prod Safety & Nutr, State Key Lab Breeding Base Zhejiang Sustainable, Hangzhou 310021, Peoples R China; [Malik, Arunima] Univ Sydney, Univ Sydney Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Sadeghpour, Amir] Southern Illinois Univ, Crop Soil & Environm Program, Sch Agr, Coll Agr Life & Phys Sci, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Zhu, Youwei] Zhejiang Agr & Rural Bur, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China; [Li, Qirui] Univ Bayreuth, Climatol Res Grp, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany",Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; University of Sydney; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; University of Bayreuth,"Deng, MH (corresponding author), Zhejiang Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Prod Safety & Nutr, State Key Lab Breeding Base Zhejiang Sustainable, Hangzhou 310021, Peoples R China.;Zhu, YW (corresponding author), Zhejiang Agr & Rural Bur, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China.",mdeng@zju.edu.cn; youwwzhu@163.com,"Zhu, Youwei/AAO-4070-2020; Zhang, Guo-Qiang/AAG-6817-2019; Malik, Arunima/IZE-7937-2023","Li, Qirui/0000-0001-8128-4401; Malik, Arunima/0000-0002-4630-9869","Key Project of Zhejiang Province [2021C04020, 2015C02011]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LGJ21D030001]",Key Project of Zhejiang Province; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"The financial support of the Key Project of Zhejiang Province (2021C04020 and 2015C02011) and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LGJ21D030001) is gratefully acknowledged.

The current study seeks to explore these skills in the high-risk domain of felling tasks within the UK forestry context.Method: Semi-structured interviews encompassing the critical incident technique were conducted with 25 forestry employees (9 chainsaw operators, 6 supervisors, 10 managers).Results: The results emphasise the relevance of NTS for chainsaw operations within the forestry context. A range of both social (leadership, teamwork & communication) and cognitive (situation awareness, decision-making, task management, cognitive readiness) NTS were identified. The elements and associated codes within each skill category illustrate the fit of these skills with the specific forestry context, with some elements entirely unique to chainsaw operations. A range of factors that could adversely impact NTS performance were also identified across five categories (external pressure, training and experience, environmental conditions, cognitive influences, individual constraints).Conclusion: The results represent the first step towards developing a NTS framework and associated behavioural marker system for forestry chainsaw operations. Further research and development are required to produce a full system that can be used to support training and assessment of NTS in practice. However, the current results can be used to raise awareness of these skills within the forestry industry, and as support for the inclusion of NTS within chainsaw operator training programs.","[Irwin, Amy; Tone, Ilinca-Ruxandra; Sobocinska, Paulina; Johansson, Sofia] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Psychol, Appl Psychol & Human Factors Grp, William Guild Bldg, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Liggins, Jason] Forestry & Land Scotland, Silvan House, Edinburgh, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Irwin, A (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Psychol, Appl Psychol & Human Factors Grp, William Guild Bldg, Aberdeen, Scotland.",a.irwin@abdn.ac.uk,"Johansson, Sofia/AAC-7447-2021",,,,,,41,1,1,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

Manifestation of confirmation bias in software testing may have adverse effects on software quality. Psychology research suggests that time pressure could trigger confirmation bias.ObjectiveIn the software industry, this phenomenon may deteriorate software quality. In this study, we investigate whether testers manifest confirmation bias and how it is affected by time pressure in functional software testing.MethodWe performed a controlled experiment with 42 graduate students to assess manifestation of confirmation bias in terms of the conformity of their designed test cases to the provided requirements specification. We employed a one factor with two treatments between-subjects experimental design.ResultsWe observed, overall, participants designed significantly more confirmatory test cases as compared to disconfirmatory ones, which is in line with previous research. However, we did not observe time pressure as an antecedent to an increased rate of confirmatory testing behaviour.ConclusionPeople tend to design confirmatory test cases regardless of time pressure. For practice, we find it necessary that testers develop self-awareness of confirmation bias and counter its potential adverse effects with a disconfirmatory attitude. We recommend further replications to investigate the effect of time pressure as a potential contributor to the manifestation of confirmation bias.","[Salman, Iflaah] Univ Oulu, Grp M3S, Oulu, Finland; [Turhan, Burak] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Vegas, Sira] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Informat, Madrid, Spain",University of Oulu; Monash University; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Salman, I (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Grp M3S, Oulu, Finland.",iflaah.salman@oulu.fi; burak.turhan@monash.edu; svegas@fi.upm.es,"Vegas, Sira/R-6742-2018; Turhan, Burak/G-7400-2011","Turhan, Burak/0000-0003-1511-2163",University of Oulu including Oulu University Hospital; Infotech Oulu Doctoral grant at the University of Oulu,University of Oulu including Oulu University Hospital; Infotech Oulu Doctoral grant at the University of Oulu,Open access funding provided by University of Oulu including Oulu University Hospital.

To contribute to the performance of automated disassembly practices, this paper presents a multiobjective decision-making approach based on the optimisation of three goals in a robotic disassembly cell framework: enhancing the economic performance of the process, reducing energy consumption and mitigating the environmental impact. Two real-use cases are presented as demonstrators, supported by appropriate, updated information from industry. The design model allowed the authors to obtain the best robotic disassembly sequence plan, the correct disassembly direction, the best recovery option for the disassembled components - reuse, remanufacturing, recycling or disposal - and the most appropriate disassembly tools, finding the optimal or near-optimal solution that best balances the three sustainability goals. An Enhanced Discrete Bees Algorithm with a mutation operator was employed to find the solution for the optimisation. Moreover, a multiobjective Bees Algorithm, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and a Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm II were adopted to solve the multiobjective optimisation problem using different iteration numbers and population sizes. The results provide insights into robotic disassembly processes, encouraging firms to adopt more automated and sustainable remanufacturing strategies.","[Hartono, Natalia; Pham, D.

Established theory suggests that 1) recognition is easier than recall [1], 2) spatial visualizations are less abstract than temporal ones [2], and 3) aesthetics induce cognitive ease [3]. These principles, and others, underpin our new audit tool that focusses on design for cognition. Theories of form, function and utility have been known for many decades and are well-known in the field of design, but infovisualization is a relatively new field, as are associated fields such as user-experience (UX), user-centered design and information design. Therefore, generally, design schools focus far more (possibly, exclusively) on teaching form, style, function, sustainability and user-experience than on visuocognition. The same emphasis is found in the design industry. This audit tool has been created to provide heuristic evaluations based on a set of visuocognitive design principles and is, therefore, a valuable contribution. To devise the visuocognitive principles, we conducted a narrative review as a method of approach. The tool is composed of one prerequisite and six principles. 'Informed Engagement' is the prerequisite to accurately inform the graphics with ground truth, and to give them substance. The six principles are: 1) clarity, 2) arrangement, 3) cued meaning, 4) intuitive meaning, 5) cognitive fit, and 6) cognitive preference. They are divided into three groups: the first two principles concern appearance, the second two principles concern meaning, and the last two principles concern cognition (Figure 1). The term 'meaning' can imply intended meaning by the designer (in a graphic representation), or construed meaning by the user. The novelty of this audit tool is that it fixes 'meaning' as the pivotal point between aesthetic visual display and mental cognition, with the aim to align construed meaning with intended meaning and achieve fluent cognition.","[Gay, Jonathan R.; Simms, Victoria] Ulster Univ, Sch Psychol, Coleraine, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Bond, Raymond R.] Ulster Univ, Sch Comp, Newtownabbey, North Ireland; [Finlay, Dewar D.] Ulster Univ, Sch Engn, Newtownabbey, North Ireland; [Purchase, Helen] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Ulster University; Ulster University; Ulster University; University of Glasgow,"Gay, JR (corresponding author), Ulster Univ, Sch Psychol, Coleraine, Londonderry, North Ireland.",gay-j@ulster.ac.uk; v.simms@ulster.ac.uk; rb.bond@ulster.ac.uk; d.finlay@ulster.ac.uk; helen.purchase@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Purchase, Helen/0000-0001-6994-4446",,,,,27,2,2,0,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-7166-7,,,,2019,,,,,,,1,5,,10.1145/3335082.3335117,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3335082.3335117,,,5,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Ergonomics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering,BQ3PE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000587608600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fortunately, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can integrate human intelligence into the collaborative robot (cobot), which can realize not merely the nimble and sapiential maintenance operations of personnel but also the reliable and repeated maintenance manipulation of cobots. However, the existing HRC maintenance lacks the precise understand of the maintenance intention, the efficient HRC decision-making for executing robotized maintenance tasks (e.g., repetitive manual tasks) and the convenient interaction interface for executing cognitive tasks (e.g., maintenance preparation and guidance job). Hence, a mixed perception-based human-robot collab-orative maintenance approach consisting of three-hierarchy structures is proposed in this paper, which can help reduce the severity of the mentioned problems. In the first stage, a mixed perception module is proposed to help the cobot recognize human safety and maintenance request according to human actions and gestures separately. During the second stage, an improved online deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making module with the asynchronous structure and the function of anti-disturbance is proposed in this paper, which can realize the execution of robotized maintenance tasks. In the third stage, an augmented reality-assisted (AR) user-friendly interaction interface is designed to help the personnel interact with the cobot and execute the auxiliary maintenance task without the limitation of spatial and human factors. In addition, the auxiliary of maintenance operation can also be supported by the AR-assisted visible guidance. Finally, comparative nu-merical experiments are implemented in a typical machining workshop, and the experimental results show a competitive performance of the proposed HRC maintenance approach compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","[Liu, Changchun; Zhang, Zequn; Tang, Dunbing; Nie, Qingwei; Zhang, Linqi; Song, Jiaye] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",zhjj370@nuaa.edu.cn,"song, jiaye/LIF-0705-2024","Zhang, Zequn/0000-0001-7597-0894; Liu, Changchun/0000-0001-8854-6136",National Key Research and Devel-opment Program of China [2020YFB1710500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52075257]; Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province [BE2021091]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX22_0340],National Key Research and Devel-opment Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province,"Acknowledgments This work was supported by the National Key Research and Devel-opment Program of China (No. 2020YFB1710500) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52075257) , the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province (No. BE2021091) , and the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. KYCX22_0340) .",,68,11,11,27,87,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

This paper studies the trust relationship ofArchitectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) professionals towards Automated Rule Checking (ARC) systems in Denmark. The 3S-model from the field of cognitive psychology was employed to help understanding the varying ways people assess information credibility. Three hypotheses were tested through experimentation to investigate the significance of different information features, and pertaining user characteristics on human-automation trust behaviors in the domain of ARC. Although the highly specified research area targeted a relatively small demographic within the Danish construction industry, the findings present an interesting new perspective on the common characteristics and trust behaviors of the end user. With the refinement of the framework's application, the 3S-model can elucidate the many factors that are believed to influence technology acceptance within the industry. This research aims to contribute to the development of ARC solutions with a front-end viewpoint on trustworthiness.","[Lehoczky, Daniel; Garcia, Dean; Gade, Peter Norkjoer] Univ Coll Northern Jutland, Dept Architectural Technol & Construct Management, Hjorring, Denmark",,"Lehoczky, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Northern Jutland, Dept Architectural Technol & Construct Management, Hjorring, Denmark.",lehoczky.dani99@gmail.com; deangarcia2006@gmail.com; pega@ucn.dk,,"Norkjaer Gade, Peter/0000-0003-2584-6726",,,,,32,0,0,0,4,INT COUNCIL RESEARCH & INNOVATION BUILDING & CONSTRUCTION,ROTTERDAM,"KRUISPLEIN 25 G, PO BOX 1837, ROTTERDAM, 3000 BV, NETHERLANDS",1874-4753,,,J INF TECHNOL CONSTR,J.

Some individuals engage in work no matter how difficult the job is, but some people's minds wander, no matter how simple the job is. To address this issue, this study drew on trait activation theory, which indicates that one's positive disposition may affect one's turnover intention mediated by work engagement, to formulate a research model to test the associations among R&D professionals. Questionnaires were distributed to R&D professionals working in China information and communication technology (ICT) through several Instant Message groups. In total, 386 valid questionnaires were collected for confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling to verify the research model. The study found that positive affect can positively predict three types of remote work engagement: the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement of R&D personnel. All three types of remote work engagement of R&D personnel can negatively predict their turnover intention. The results suggest that if human resource managers working in the ICT industry want to reduce the turnover intention rate of R&D workers under pressure from COVID-19, they should enhance workers' remote engagement by selecting R&D workers with a high level of positive affect.","[Hong, Jon-Chao] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Inst Res Excellence Learning Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Petsangsri, Sirirat] King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Dept Ind Educ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Cui, Yuting] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Vocat & Adult Educ, Fac Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China",National Taiwan Normal University; King Mongkuts Institute of Technology Ladkrabang; Beijing Normal University,"Cui, YT (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Vocat & Adult Educ, Fac Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ytcui937@mail.bnu.edu.cn,"; Petsangsri, Sirirat/ADG-7940-2022","Yuting, Cui/0000-0001-6286-4486; Petsangsri, Sirirat/0000-0002-4828-1740",,,,,75,3,5,4,46,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

However, due to privacy protection and many other reasons, it is almost impossible to obtain all the data needed to construct the social network structure model, so it is necessary to study the use of incomplete data to construct the social network structure model. Although there are many methods to construct social network structure model, there are some problems. The research shows that human social group behavior shows some specific behavior patterns, and there are many corresponding structures and changes within the group. The main means adopted by smart city is information and communication technology to study, plan and sense multiple key information of urban internal operation system, that is, it can intelligently interact with different needs of public security, urban services, people's livelihood, environmental protection, industrial and commercial projects. The key lies in the adoption of high-end information sensing means, so that the city can operate and manage intelligently, improve the quality of life of urban people, and promote social harmony and long-term development. Therefore, this paper studies the next generation social network system of smart city based on software reconfiguration model and cognitive computing. We design the model based on the improvement of the traditional social networks to obtain the efficient representation and combine the software reconstruction model to improve the robustness.

In this paper, the author proposes a method to overcome the problem of reaction time for a human in the control loop. This method, called Time Scaling Control, starts by modifying the constant times of the plant's model to the point where control is comfortable for a human. Then, the controller acquires the knowledge that was expressed during the human control stage and places it in a Neural Network, which controls both scaled and original plants. Time Scaling Control highly improves the control performance compared with a PID, in this case demonstrated by the control of a direct current motor, which cannot be controlled by a human without time scaling control due to the speed of the system.","[Rairan Antolines, Jose Danilo] Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; [Rairan Antolines, Jose Danilo] Univ Dist Francisco Jose de Caldas, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas,"Antolines, JDR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia.;Antolines, JDR (corresponding author), Univ Dist Francisco Jose de Caldas, Bogota, Colombia.",drairan@udistrital.edu.co,,"Rairan, Jose Danilo/0000-0002-1213-7333",,,,,20,0,0,0,2,"UNIV NAC COLOMBIA, FAC INGENIERIA",BOGOTA,"CARRERA 30 NO 45-03, EDIFICIO 408 CADE, BOGOTA, DC 00000, COLOMBIA",0120-5609,2248-8723,,ING INVEST,Ing.

Industrial factory layouts are moving robots out of enclosures bringing them side by side with human workers. As for service robots they are by definition meant to perform tasks in our immediate proximity. To be performed successfully, these tasks, also referred to as joint actions, require coordination and trust. Coordination implies that the robot needs to account for his actions and their effects on the environment but also for changes that the user introduces. Therefore, flexible planning capacities allowing on-the-fly adaptation to what a human is requesting or doing, together with a shared mental representation of the task, are needed. In this paper we present (i) a symbolic knowledge system and the way it translates into simple temporal networks (STN) to generate actions plans, and (ii) interaction models based on natural language. First results indicate the robot can build plans for a joint action according to several parameters given its conceptual semantic description. Furthermore, a human can interactively either modify the plan or ask for explanations about it. By several experiments we demonstrate the generation and adaptation of these dynamic human-robot collaboration plans.","[Angleraud, Alexandre; Houbre, Quentin; Netzev, Metodi; Pieters, Roe] Tampere Univ, Dept Automat Technol & Mech Engn, Cognit Robot, Tampere 33720, Finland",Tampere University,"Angleraud, A (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Dept Automat Technol & Mech Engn, Cognit Robot, Tampere 33720, Finland.",alexandre.angleraud@tuni.fi; quentin.houbre@tuni.fi; metodi.netzev@tuni.fi; roe.pieters@tuni.fi,,"Houbre, Quentin/0000-0003-1990-8935; Pieters, Roel/0000-0001-6728-304X; Angleraud, Alexandre Francois/0000-0002-2291-1329",,,,,26,2,2,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2161-8070,,978-1-7281-0356-3,IEEE INT CON AUTO SC,,,2019,,,,,,,942,947,,10.1109/coase.2019.8842842,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/coase.2019.8842842,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science,BP5KA,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000555890700151,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, an integrated network, which is capable of recognizing emotion intensity levels from facial images in real time using deep learning technique is proposed. The cognitive study of facial expressions based on expression intensity levels are useful in applications such as healthcare, coboting, Industry 4.0 etc. This work proposes to augment emotion recognition with 2 other important parameters, valence and emotion intensity. This helps in better automated responses by a machine to an emotion. The valence model helps in classifying emotion as positive and negative emotions and discrete model classifies emotions as happy, anger, disgust, surprise and neutral state using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Feature extraction and classification are carried out using CMU Multi -PIE database. The proposed architecture achieves 99.1% and 99.11% accuracy for valence model and discrete model respectively for offline image data with 5-fold cross validation. The average accuracy achieved in real time for valance model and discrete model is 95% & 95.6% respectively. Also, this work contributes to build a new database using facial landmarks, with three intensity levels of facial expressions which helps to classify ex-pressions into low, mild and high intensities. The performance is also tested for different classifiers. The proposed integrated system is configured for real time Human Robot Interaction (HRI) applications on a test bed consisting of Raspberry Pi and RPA platform to assess its performance.","[Saxena, Suchitra; Tripathi, Shikha; Sudarshan, T.

These capabilities allow users to monitor the status of the involved systems, to view trends and statistics, and to inspect the events and data that led to specific violations when diagnosing their root cause. We first performed a walkthrough of the tool using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework from the field of human-computer interaction. We then conducted a user study involving five software engineers of a large company from the automation software domain and four researchers. Using the tool's visualization capabilities all subjects succeeded in monitoring a real-world automation system and in diagnosing violations. Subjects regarded the visualization capabilities as essential for understanding the behavior of a complex system.

A Process Management System (PMS) employed for executing CPPs is required to automatically adapt its running processes to anomalous situations and exogenous events by minimising any human intervention. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing an approach and an adaptive Cognitive PMS, called SmartPM, which combines process execution monitoring, unanticipated exception detection and automated resolution strategies leveraging on three well-established action-based formalisms developed for reasoning about actions in Artificial Intelligence (AI), including the situation calculus, IndiGolog and automated planning. Interestingly, the use of SmartPM does not require any expertise of the internal working of the AI tools involved in the system.","[Marrella, Andrea; Mecella, Massimo] Sapienza Univ Roma, Rome, Italy; [Sardina, Sebastian] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Sapienza University Rome; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Marrella, A (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Roma, Rome, Italy.",marrella@diag.uniroma1.it,"Mecella, Massimo/N-8699-2019","Sardina, Sebastian/0000-0003-2962-0118",EU FP-6 WORKPAD; EU FP-7 [SM4A11]; Italian Sapienza grant TESTMED; Italian Sapienza grant SUPER; Italian Sapienza grant DAKIP; Italian Sapienza award SPIR-ITLETS; Italian projects Social Museum and Smart Tourism [CTN01_00034_23154]; NEPTIS [PON03PE_00214_3]; RoMA Resilence of Metropolitan Areas [SCN_00064],EU FP-6 WORKPAD; EU FP-7(European Union (EU)); Italian Sapienza grant TESTMED; Italian Sapienza grant SUPER; Italian Sapienza grant DAKIP; Italian Sapienza award SPIR-ITLETS; Italian projects Social Museum and Smart Tourism; NEPTIS; RoMA Resilence of Metropolitan Areas,"This work has been partly supported over the years by the following projects: EU FP-6 WORKPAD, EU FP-7 SM4A11, Italian Sapienza grants TESTMED, SUPER and DAKIP, Italian Sapienza award SPIR-ITLETS, Italian projects Social Museum and Smart Tourism (CTN01_00034_23154), NEPTIS (PON03PE_00214_3), and RoMA Resilence of Metropolitan Areas (SCN_00064).

Previous studies mainly focused on justifying theories associated with human errors and hardly quantifying the causal relations between external stimuli and human errors. Hence, the aim of this research is to develop comprehensive management measurements for addressing human errors in construction projects. Deductive reasoning was used to describe the methodological process. Firstly, we constructed a theoretical model of human errors based on Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) and knowledge-combined structure learning algorithm. Then, Bootstrap method was adopted to verify the reliability of network topology, while the similarity-flooding algorithm was used to analyze similarity of factors across various causal models for their commonalities. Subsequently, Bayesian parameter estimation was to analyze the sensitivity of the nodes. The results show that inadequate quality control, design failure and inattention are the most fundamental causes of human errors in promoting safety management. This research has proposed an analytical approach that consolidated the influential mechanics to reflect the overall influence of a root cause in the human error. Ultimately, the research lays an analytical foundation for safety management research in the future.","[Liao, Pin-Chao; Ma, Zhangming] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chong, Heap-Yih] Curtin Univ, Sch Built Environm, Dept Construct Management, Perth, WA, Australia",Tsinghua University; Curtin University,"Ma, ZM (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pinchao@tsinghua.edu.cn; mzm17@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; heap-yih.chong@curtin.edu.au,"Liao, Pin-Chao/Z-3750-2019; Chong, Heap-Yih/M-8354-2017","Chong, Heap-Yih/0000-0002-6080-7530",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51578317]; United Technologies Corporation [20153000259],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); United Technologies Corporation,We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51578317) and the United Technologies Corporation (No. 20153000259) for their support.

In this study, a quantitative cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) is developed that provides point estimates of the human error probability (HEP) in tanker operational safety. In effect, the quantitative CREAM incorporates weightage of common performance conditions (CPCs) that are graded by the stakeholders (experts and seafarers). As different from the nine standard CPCs in the original CREAM, eight customised CPCs are proposed to better capture the essential aspects of the work situations and conditions for on-board tankers. The weighting of the CPCs is calculated by fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), which provides reliable and practical results, while Markov method is applied to calculate human reliability and the mean time to human error. An exemplified application using five seafarers' reliability analysis generated quantified results of human performance failure consistent with that produced by the original CREAM. The quantitative CREAM developed in this research is useful for evaluating the reliability of on-board crew members, which contributes to a safety and more reliable shipping industry.

This combination was proposed from the perceived need to structure one of the stages of the application of the CAST technique where unsafe control actions, or human errors, that occurred in the course of accidental events are analyzed, for which the application of the TRACEr technique proved extremely useful. From the application of the proposed combination to an accident that occurred in an oil production unit in operation on the coast of southeastern Brazil, it was possible to obtain a deeper understanding of the psychological phenomena that preceded one of the unsafe control actions, as well as the identification of performance shaping factors that contributed to its occurrence. These results demonstrated the conceptual cohesion and mutual complementarity of the associated techniques, which allowed a comprehensive understanding of the accidental event and, consequently, the elaboration of safety recommendations more appropriate to the findings of the analysis, better specified to the aspects of human factors involved.","[Fagundes, Jose Moises] Natl Civil Aviat Agcy, Dept Civil Aviat Personnel, Av Presidente Vargas 850, BR-20071001 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Fagundes, Jose Moises; Alberton, Andre Luis] State Univ Rio de Janeiro UERJ, Operat & Ind Projects Dept, R Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Gaya de Figueiredo, Marco Antonio] State Univ Rio de Janeiro UERJ, Operat & Ind Projects Dept, Petr & Petrochem Engn & Technol Lab LETPP, R Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Antonio Luquetti dos Santos, Isaac Jose] Natl Nucl Energy Commiss, Inst Nucl Engn, R Helio de Almeida 75, BR-21945906 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro,"Fagundes, JM (corresponding author), Natl Civil Aviat Agcy, Dept Civil Aviat Personnel, Av Presidente Vargas 850, BR-20071001 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",jose.fagundes@anac.gov.br; mgaya@uerj.br; andreluisalberton@gmail.com; luquetti@ien.gov.br,"Fagundes, José Moisés/KGL-9071-2024; Alberton, Andre/AAE-6994-2021",,,,,,32,4,4,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-4230,1873-3352,,J LOSS PREVENT PROC,J.

However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry.","[Wu, Shaoze; Hou, Lei; Chen, Haosen; Zhang, Guomin (Kevin); Tushar, Quddus] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Zou, Yang] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland 1023, New Zealand",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Auckland,"Hou, L (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",shaoze.wu@student.rmit.edu.au; lei.hou@rmit.edu.au; haosen.chen@student.rmit.edu.au; kevin.zhang@rmit.edu.au; yang.zou@auckland.ac.nz; quddus.tushar@rmit.edu.au,"Zou, Yang/HLQ-0796-2023; Wu, Shaoze/CAG-5467-2022; ZOU, YANG/A-6403-2016","Wu, Shaoze/0000-0001-7907-7999; Chen, Haosen/0000-0001-5804-7985; ZOU, YANG/0000-0001-6150-6126; Zhang, Guomin Kevin/0000-0002-3503-7431; Tushar, Quddus/0000-0002-8731-6627",,,,,62,16,16,11,53,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

However, the acceptance of AI has been hindered by opaque models that lack transparency. Explainability in AI (XAI) has gained significant prominence owing to its focus on introducing avenues of accountability in AI. XAI acknowledges the importance of human factors and strives to incorporate them into the design process, recognising that the cognitive effort involved in understanding explanations is a key aspect. Mental Models play a crucial role in the XAI evaluative premise, but their current utility is limited. By intentionally designing explanations that align with users' mental models, their experiences can be significantly enhanced, leading to improved understanding, satisfaction, trust, and performance.

Multimodal input user interfaces have significant role in different domains, for example industrial plants or hospitals, also they have implications for accessibility. To develop multimodal applications in formally rigorous settings, software developer teams may use tools or a software development kit to increase the efficiency and the quality of the resulted software artifacts. Such a technique is performing the design with software modeling and applying model transformations to generate well-defined components of the software. Furthermore, representation-bridging communication is a discipline of cognitive infocommunications, where the sensory information transferred to the receiver entity is filtered and/or converted. Whenever such approaches are used, the challenges associated with the modeling of information requirements, user capabilities and cross-model interactions are compounded and further increase the need for formal design and verification tools. Applying model transformations is a way to support this activity. Communication-intensive solutions often require complex methods, i.e. significant model transformation efforts between the different representations. Important semantic information should be preserved and not misinterpreted in a complex model transformations. Therefore, methods are required to verify that the semantics used during the application generation and analysis are indeed preserved across the transformation. As a case in point, such a model transformation could yield embedded code for a given type of electronic driver assistant system based on a high-level characterizations of the information to be transferred and the driver's cognitive capabilities. Later, a multimodal interactions expert could easily modify those characterizations on demand, and regenerate a modified version of the software without having to know about the low-level details of the embedded platform. This paper provides a strong motivation regarding the necessity of methods to support verification and validation of model transformations supporting multimodal application development and cognitive infocommunications. As the main result of the paper, we compile a list of open issues in the field of verification/validation of model transformations, and link those issues to the development of multimodal interfaces. Through its discussions, the paper makes the point that the design practices behind multimodal interfaces could strongly benefit from the use of formal modeling techniques in general, and model transformation approaches in particular.","[Lengyel, Laszlo; Charaf, Hassan] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Automat & Appl Informat, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Lengyel, L (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Automat & Appl Informat, Magyar Tudosok Korutja 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",lengyel@aut.bme.hu; hassan@aut.bme.hu,,,Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; [TAMOP-4.2.1.D-15/1/KONV-2015-0008],Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences);,This work was partially supported by the TAMOP-4.2.1.D-15/1/KONV-2015-0008 project.

At the same time, the volume and global scope of digital game telemetry data has opened up new experimental opportunities for studying human behavior at large scales. Prior research has demonstrated that a relation exists between learning rates and performance. Although many factors might contribute to this correlation at least one may be the presence of innate cognitive resources, as demonstrated in recent work relating IQ and performance in a Multi-player Online Battle Arena game. Here, we extend this work by examining the relationship between early learning rate and long term performance using a 400,000 player longitudinal dataset generated by new players of the widely-played MOBA League of Legends. We observed that the learning rate of new players in a competitive season explains a significant amount of variance in the performance at the end of the year. This analysis was then extended by training two multivariate classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for predicting players who by the end of the season would be considered masters (top 0.05%), based on their performance in the first 10 matches of the same season. Both classifiers performed similarly (ROC AUC 0.888 for Logistic Regression, 0.878 for Random Forest), extending the time frame for skill prediction in games based on a relatively sparse sample of early data. We discuss the implications for these findings based on preexisting psychological studies of learning and intelligence, and close with challenges and direction for future research.","[Aung, M.; Bonometti, V; Drachen, A.; Cowling, P.] Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Kokkinakis, A., V; Wade, A.] Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Yoder, C.] Riot Games, Los Angeles, CA 90064 USA","University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Riot Games, Inc","Aung, M (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",mta510@york.ac.uk; vb690@york.ac.uk; anders.drachen@york.ac.uk; peter.cowling@york.ac.uk; avk504@york.ac.uk; cyoder@riotgames.com; wade@wadelab.net,"Wade, Alex/B-5473-2010; Drachen, Anders/L-4690-2017","Drachen, Anders/0000-0002-1002-0414; Kokkinakis, Athanasios/0000-0002-9048-340X; Wade, Alexander Robert/0000-0003-4871-2747",EPSRC/AHRC/InnovateUK [EP/M023265/1]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/L015846/1],EPSRC/AHRC/InnovateUK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UKEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"We thank Riot Games for providing the data used in this work.

Design/methodology/approachA multiple case study was conducted in organisations that were previously committed to Lean practices and had a multi-cultural work environment. This research was conducted on five companies based on 99 in-depth semi-structured interviews and seven process observations that sought to establish the system-wide cognitive biases present in a multi-cultural Lean environment. FindingsThe novel findings indicate that nine new biases influence Lean implementation and practices in a multi-cultural environment. This study also found strong connectivity between Lean practices and 45 previously identified biases that could affect positively or negatively the lean methodologies and their implementation. Biases were resilient enough that their influence on Lean in multi-cultural workplaces, even with transient populations, did not demonstrate cultural differentiation. Research limitations/implicationsLike any qualitative research, constructivism and narrative analyses are subjected to understanding based on knowledge gained on the subject, and data may have been interpreted differently. Constructivist co-recreation of process scenarios based result limitations is therefore acknowledged. The interactive participation in exploring the knowledge sought after and interaction that could have a probable influence on the participant need to be acknowledged. However, the research design, multiple methods of data collection, generalisation based on data collection and analysis methods limit the effects of these and findings are reliable to a greater extent. Practical implicationsThe results can provide an enhanced understanding of biases and insights into a new managerial approach to take remedial steps on biases' influence on Lean practices that can result in improved productivity and well-being from a business process perspective. Understanding and mitigating the prominent biases can aid Lean manufacturing processes and support decision makers and line managers in improving lean methodologies' effectiveness and productivity. The biases can be negated and used to implement decisions with ease. The influence of biases and the model could be used as a basis to counter implementation barriers. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that connects the cognitive perspectives of Lean business processes in a multi-cultural environment to identify the cognitive biases that influence Lean practices in organisations that were previously committed to Lean practices. The novel findings indicate that nine new biases and 45 previously identified biases influence Lean implementation and practices in a multi-cultural environment.

The paper presents a methodology to collect empirical data in an unstructured manner utilizing participant intuition and experience regarding project level collaboration, a term easily understood by practitioners. Empirical data collected from 6 focus group discussions in Norway and 18 individual interviews in Finland is associated with biases in decision making aimed at bridging the gap of understanding and literature's insufficient coverage. An analytic framework was developed to suit the diverse emergence of concepts to allow application of psychological principles in a structured manner to empirical data. The paper contributes by identifying types of cognitive and motivational biases in client involved decisions. The biases are found to be alleviated by one another depending on the particular application of the decision. Findings suggest that normative beliefs exist developed from past experience and habitual thinking. A number of emerged biases in this domain are alleviated from normative beliefs which are discussed in this paper.","[Sujan, Sujesh F.; Jones, Steve W.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Engn, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Kiviniemi, Arto] Univ Liverpool, Sch Architecture, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Wheathcroft, Jacqueline M.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Psychol Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Hjelseth, Eilif] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Sujan, SF (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Engn, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",S.F.Sujan@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Wheatcroft, Jacqueline/0000-0001-7212-1598; Sujan, Sujesh/0000-0002-3063-1087",University of Liverpool,University of Liverpool,This study was supported by the open access funding provided by University of Liverpool.,,66,5,7,0,4,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-7513,2096-0255,,FRONT ENG MANAG,Front.

Before setting up this education method, factor analysis for female engineering students at P University, which is a model university in South Korea, was conducted. The analytical results showed that social and cultural effects are more significant ones than social effect alone, and the effects of gender discrimination in industrial fields. Also results showed responses that the physical differences between man and women students, such as the ability to drive printing machines or to handle tools, their parents' financial support for experiments, and the gender cognitive engineering education. In this research, we developed the measurement tool to measure women students' competencies in GAP industries and contributed to make the women in engineering education according to the results of factor analysis. These researches have been progressed since 2006 annually, and we had proposed to programs for the gender cognitive engineering education and the special programs for women engineering students. The retention rate of female engineering students was increased from 30% at 2006 to over 50% in 2016. And the rate of women students who change their major from 5% to decreased 1 %. According to the lecture evaluation, 98% of women students were very satisfied the simulated education method.

It was recognized as a site of archaeological interest in 2003. Excavations are scheduled every year, and important archaeological material (lithic, faunal and human) has been brought to light. A first study on the lithic industry was carried out by S. Almisas and M. Souhir [2018] under the title of New studies on the lithic industry of the Neolithic deposits of the Oujda Mountains. Raw material and technology [Reg.03 Upper Pleistocene and Holocene cognitive complexity & archaeogenetics in North Africa 15th PANAF Conference, Rabat 2018]. The study is based on technological techniques, the typology of cut products and also on the origin of the raw material used. The lithic industry is abundant, well preserved in all levels and phases of the operating chain are present, indicating debitage in situ in the cave. The artefacts are brought back to the Neolithic for the upper levels, then to the final Upper Paleolithic (or Epipaleolithic) for the lower levels, marked by a change in culture with the ap- pearance of back-to-body lamellae. The first analyses of the raw material used by prehistoric man in this cave, in particular the flint, generally comes from the Swimina area, located to the south of the Oued El Hay basin (Ain Beni Mathar). The limestones come from the surroundings of the mountains of 'Oujda, plains and wadis. As for the basalt, it comes from an ancient Quaternary volcano located near the cave at the top of Jebel Metssila. In turn, quartzites, phtanites, silicified green schist and tuffite, they come from the Paleozoic buttonholes of Glib Naam and jbel boussofane (Province of Jerada). Given the information above, it appears that the man from Guenfouda may have used various rocks for the manufacturing of tools, and would have traveled distances of up to 60 km in radius to stock up on raw material, especially flint.","[Souhir, Mohamed; Aouraghe, Hassan; Mhamdi, Hicham] Univ Mohamed Premier, Dept Geol, Fac Sci, Oujda, Morocco; [Cruz, Sergio Almisas] Univ Cadis, Dept Hist Geog & Philosophie, Fac Philosophie & Lettres, Cadiz, Spain",Mohammed First University of Oujda,"Souhir, M (corresponding author), Univ Mohamed Premier, Dept Geol, Fac Sci, Oujda, Morocco.",m.souhir@ump.ac.ma,,"Mohamed, SOUHIR/0000-0001-7558-3077; mhamdi, hicham/0000-0002-8284-0294; Aouraghe, hassan/0000-0001-7887-366X",,,,,25,0,0,0,2,POLISH SOC ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING-PTIE,LUBLIN,"LUBLIN UNIV TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FAC, NADBYSTRZYCKA 40B, LUBLIN, 20618, POLAND",2299-8993,,,J ECOL ENG,J.

Current theorizing emphasizes that people see hypocrisy when an individual sends them false signals about his or her morality (Jordan, Sommers, Bloom, & Rand, 2017); indeed, the canonical hypocrite acts more virtuously in public than in private. An alternative theory posits that people see hypocrisy when an individual enjoys undeserved moral benefits, such as feeling more virtuous than his or her behavior merits, even when the individual has not sent false signals to others (Effron, O'Connor, Leroy, & Lucas, 2018). This theory predicts that acting less virtuously in public than in private can seem hypocritical by indicating that individuals have used good deeds to feel less guilty about their public sins than they should. Seven experiments (N = 3,468 representing 64 nationalities) supported this prediction. Participants read about a worker in a sin industry who secretly performed good deeds. When the individual's public work (e.g., selling tobacco) was inconsistent with, versus unrelated to, the good deeds (e.g., anonymous donations to an antismoking cause vs. an antiobesity cause), participants perceived him as more hypocritical, which in turn predicted less praise for his good deeds. Participants also inferred that the individual was using the inconsistent good deeds to cleanse his conscience for his public work, and such moral cleansing appeared hypocritical when it successfully alleviated his guilt. These results broaden and deepen understanding about how lay people conceptualize hypocrisy. Hypocrisy does not require appearing more virtuous than you are; it suffices to feel more virtuous than you deserve.","[O'Connor, Kieran] Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, 125 Ruppel Dr, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Effron, Daniel A.] London Business Sch, Org Behav Subject Area, London, England; [Lucas, Brian J.] Cornell Univ, Ind & Lab Relat Sch, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Virginia; University of London; London Business School; Cornell University,"O'Connor, K (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, 125 Ruppel Dr, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",oconnor@virginia.edu,"Effron, Daniel/I-7721-2015","O'Connor, Kieran/0000-0001-5035-9861; Effron, Daniel/0000-0002-4122-6175",,,,,119,24,25,12,173,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

From theories in Science & Technology Studies we learn that the development of new technology cannot be meaningful unless there are users that successfully adapt the products and services to their own lives. As a result, it is important that designers learn to explore the interrelationships between engineering and behavioural, cultural and social issues. Within our Industrial Design Engineering curriculum we therefore emphasise the influence of technology on human behaviour and vice-versa. Although every specific product and context demands for a specific relation, we have experienced that there is common ground in the developments of these relationships that makes our education work. At a higher level of abstraction, the human side of the relation stays merely the same, because human bodies and human needs and emotions do not develop fast. It is only the technology side of the relation that develops and therefore changes the relationship. Thus, by starting from the human side of the relationship, the technology side can be consciously developed and shaped. A carefully designed series of courses in Design Aesthetics, Philosophy of Technology, Cognitive Ergonomics and Usability develops the students ability to analyse the human needs and characteristics, to understand the impact of technology, and provides the skills to shape the desired relationships. And although we do not design robots, our experience with Industrial Design Engineering is that human technology relations are apparent within all sorts of design challenges.","[Eggink, Wouter] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Ind Design Engn, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Eggink, W (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Ind Design Engn, Enschede, Netherlands.",,,"Eggink, Wouter/0000-0002-6862-5483",,,,,10,3,3,0,2,DESIGN SOC,GLASGOW,"109 DUNDEE DRIVE, GLASGOW, G52 3HL, SCOTLAND",,,978-1-904670-56-8,E&PDE,,,2014,,,,,,,87,92,,,,,,6,"Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Education & Educational Research; Engineering,BO2PD,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000506888800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Published literature are available regarding independent impact of product personality and product usability on product choice but no research has been reported so far for understanding their collective influence on product choice. In addition, which factor between usability and product personality contributing more in product choice is still not clear. Current research thus aimed to bridge these research gaps by establishing inter-relationships among product personality, usability and product choice. To achieve this goal, two separate experiments were conducted. Results of first experiment revealed that products having high product usability also possessed strong product personality. Following second experiment, it was observed that solitary influence of product usability on product choice was more than the standalone influence of product personality in human-product physical interaction. Moreover, it unfolded the fact that product usability mediates the influence of product personality towards product choice. Established interrelationships among product personality, usability and product choice, would help designer and ergonomists to decide how product attributes could be manipulated to enhance product personality and/or product usability to ensure product choice. Relevance to industry: Techniques mentioned in the current paper for product usability/personality assessment, have significant implication in product design. Gained knowledge will be helpful for industrial designer or human factors experts to incorporate various positive product usability attributes to enhance product personality or vice-versa for assuring acceptance of product in market.

AR HUDs provide a fundamentally new driving experience in which drivers still have to respond to both the road and the information provided by the system, creating the perfect atmosphere for potentially unsafe and distracting interfaces. As we start fielding and designing for new AR HUDs displays, the complexities of interface design and its impacts on driver performance must be further understood before AR HUDs can be broadly and safely incorporated into vehicles. Nevertheless, existing methods for assessing the usefulness of computer-based user interfaces may not be sufficiently rich to measure the overall impact of AR HUD interfaces on human performance. Therefore, in my Ph.D. research, I focus on developing and testing methods to evaluate AR HUDs' effects on driver distraction and performance. My primary goal is to assess glance allocation and visual capabilities of drivers with AR HUDs and apply this knowledge to inform new methods of AR HUD assessment that account for inattentional blindness and cognitive tunneling.","[Faria, Nayara de Oliveira] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Faria, ND (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",nfaria@vt.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1816721]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1816721] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)NSF - Division of Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS)),This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1816721,,11,4,4,10,90,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-7281-6532-5,,,,2020,,,,,,,553,554,,10.1109/VRW50115.2020.0-148,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VRW50115.2020.0-148,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BQ1XM,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000578054300121,View Full Record in Web of Science

Each of these sensors has its advantages and disadvantages suggesting that finally all available features should be fused. While in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research powerful methods for the real-time extraction of information from brain signals have been developed, comparatively little effort was spent on the extraction of hidden user states. As a further step in this direction, we propose a novel experimental paradigm to study the feasibility of quantifying how deeply presented information is processed in the brain.

Past studies have limited focus on the human system interfacial approach. However, the repeated failures have forced the industry and academia to take a closer look at the cascading failures with human errors perspective and conduct the root-cause analysis from the cognitive aspect. Traditionally, the knowledge, expertize, and competence took the driving seat while the human factors had been on the back burner. Lack of emphasis on Human Factors in academic research could be another reason for this laxity. Consideration of human factors in the design of systems is centered on the end user. Systems are designed to fit the physiological limitations of the people tasked with managing them. The design includes features that improve comfort and productivity, minimize errors, and minimize training time. In this paper, first a review of crucial human factors in different well cycles such as drilling, well completion, fracturing, and abandonment will be presented. Through various cases studies, it will be shown that potential challenges can be mitigated with proper implementation of various elements for human factors such as situational awareness, team working, stress management and other non-technical skills. In addition, this paper reviews the critical components and perceived gaps of existing safety management systems in use as well as those elements that would be of most value to drilling taken from other sectors or industries on a 'first principles' basis. The paper attempts to highlight 'the myths, misconceptions, and realities of complex well operations' that either deter changes or demand a new approach. It is the authors premise that if either a 'clean sheet' approach or more 'actual cost' weight was given to both common problems and low probability high consequence events such as kicks or loss of well control.","[Kiran, Raj; Salehi, Saeed; Teodoriu, Catalin] Univ Oklahoma, MPGE, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Kiran, R (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, MPGE, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",,"Salehi, Saeed/E-1515-2018; Kiran, Raj/IUO-3981-2023","Salehi, Saeed/0000-0002-6649-5136","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","The authors would like to acknowledge the project sponsor, Gulf Research Program of.

However, few studies have focused on the dynamic changes in cognitive functions and physiological responses under extreme heat stress. This study investigated the cognitive impairment over exposure time at various ambient temperatures, ranging from 21.15 degrees C WBGT to 38.93 degrees C WBGT, and its underlying physiological mechanism. 30 well-trained volunteers and 8 occupational operators participated in the experiments, with typical cognitive tests, ECG, and fNIRS measurements. Negative correlations were mainly observed between cognitive test accuracy, ECG RRI, ECG RMSSD, ECG HF/LF, fNIRS ALFF, fNIRS functional connectivity (CORRz, COH, PLV), and exposure time. This indicated that increased physical load, stress, and decreased regulation ability to sudden changes, cognitive resource input, and inter-regional brain cooperation were key factors contributing to cognitive impairments over time. A comprehensive performance index (CPI) was established by the weighted sum of accuracy in cognitive tests and physiological features of ECG and fNIRS. The weights suggested fNIRS ALFF, ECG RRI, and fNIRS functional connectivity could be potential biomarkers for cognitive assessment. A set of linear quantitative CPI curves over exposure time was supplied to calculate the thermal tolerance exposure time at various risk tolerances and ambient temperatures. A power- law relationship (R-2 > 0.997) . 997 ) was observed between the thermal tolerance exposure time and the standardized temperature. This study provides a physiological insight into cognitive impairment under prolonged heat exposure, and quantitative thermal tolerance exposure curves to evaluate safe thermal working duration for both low-risk groups (officers and drivers) and high-risk groups (operators in industry).","[Jia, Ming; Xu, Zhihui] China Nucl Power Engn Co Ltd, State Key Lab Nucl Power Safety Technol & Equipmen, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan; Chen, Tao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Safety Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yaobin; He, Yong] CGN LuFeng Nucl Power Co Ltd, Lufeng 516500, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xipeng; Zuo, Lu] CGN Huizhou Nucl Power Co Ltd, Huizhou 516300, Guangdong, Peoples R China",China Nuclear Power Engineering Co Ltd.; Tsinghua University,"Xu, ZH (corresponding author), China Nucl Power Engn Co Ltd, State Key Lab Nucl Power Safety Technol & Equipmen, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xuzhihui@hrbeu.edu.cn,"yuan, peng/HDO-2988-2022","zhang, yan/0000-0002-8573-0111","State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Power Safety Technology and Equipment, China Nuclear Power Engi-neering Co., Ltd.

The common performance conditions (CPCs) in conventional CREAM approach are custom-modified to better capture the salient aspects of the situations and conditions for on-board tanker work. Fuzzy logic technique using triangle and trapezoidal membership functions is applied to model the uncertainty and ambiguity of the CPCs as well the control modes in CREAM. A Bayesian network reasoning model using the membership of CPCs as inputs is developed which determines the probability distribution of the control modes. Human error probability (HEP) is obtained from memberships of the control modes and the results of Bayesian network reasoning. A case study in tanker shipping industry with 18 crew members is provided, and the results show that the evaluation of HEP according to the proposed HRA model is very promising and the HRA model is consistent with the original CREAM approach. The sensitivity of the model is also checked against the inputs of the crew members. It is concluded that the enhanced HRA model is able to provide reliable human performance failure results.","[Zhou, Qingji; Wong, Yiik Diew] Nanyang Technol Univ, Maritime Inst NTU, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Zhou, Qingji; Wong, Yiik Diew] Nanyang Technol Univ, Ctr Infrastruct Syst, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Blk N1-B1b-09,50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Loh, Hui Shan] Singapore Univ Social Sci, Sch Business, Logist & Supply Chain Management Programme, 463 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599494, Singapore; [Yuen, Kum Fai] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea",Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS); Chung Ang University,"Yuen, KF (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",qjzhou@ntu.edu.sg; cydwong@ntu.edu.sg; hsloh@suss.edu.sg; yuenkf@cau.ac.kr,"Zhou, Qingji/AAL-5301-2020; Yuen, Kum/K-2994-2019; WONG, Yiik Diew/A-3761-2011; Yuen, Kum Fai/B-8244-2015","Loh, Hui Shan/0000-0003-0727-8315; Zhou, Qingji/0000-0002-5832-1304; WONG, Yiik Diew/0000-0001-7419-5777; Yuen, Kum Fai/0000-0002-9199-6661",Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI),Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI),This research is supported by the Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI) to which the authors express their gratitude.,,37,107,120,8,138,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

By using advanced AI, these assistants are becoming part of our daily digital lifestyle. It is foreseen by Gartner (2019) that AI-based virtual assistants will become a key element in the future of work in smart organizations. Furthermore, another disruptive technology that is impacting the workplace today and is expected to have greater impact in the future is Internet of Things. For AI technology to be useful, it is necessary to have access to significant volumes of data. IoT devices can be one of the main, and important, sources of data for building smart decisions, communications and recommendations of a virtual assistant. In this research, we are proposing a Virtual Employee Assistant (VEA) named Eleanor. Unlike chatbots that are used as an information acquisition interface such as extracting product details, or Robotic Process Automation (RPA) that automates the routine and repetitive tasks of employees, Eleanor is a cognitive-based virtual assistant platform that will provide personalized recommendations for employees based on collected data from IoT devices, employee organizational data and Human Resource (HR) applications in organizations. The data collected from connected devices (i.e. fitness trackers such as Fitbit, office connected devices, attendance tracking machines and more), employee organizational sources (number of subordinates, job criticality level, number of meetings per day, number of raised incidents.), employee behavioural data (Facial emotion classifier, communications per day, feedback survey.), HR applications sources (employee profile, catering system details.) will be used to build personalized recommendations and to provide coaching per individual employee with specific focus on health benefits (mental and physical) leading to better performance and productivity. In contrast to the existing virtual assistants, Eleanor virtual assistant proactively coaches employees using cognitive services such as Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on their previous, existing and next planned actions along with Natural Language Processing (NLP). The proposed model is flexible and can be adapted to any organization. This paper carries the proposed model along with its implementation.","[Nia, Mona Bokharaei] IAU, Tehran South Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Kazemi, Mohammadali Afshar] IAU, Tehran Cent Branch, Tehran, Iran",,"Nia, MB (corresponding author), IAU, Tehran South Branch, Tehran, Iran.",M_bokharaeinia@azad.ac.ir; dr.mafshar@gmail.com,"afshar kazemi, mohammad ali/AAW-7738-2021; Bokharaei Nia, Mona/ABA-5412-2021",,,,,,29,0,0,5,60,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912764-44-0,,,,2019,,,,,,,413,422,,10.34190/ECIAIR.19.101,http://dx.doi.org/10.34190/ECIAIR.19.101,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Robotics,BP1JZ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000539633500047,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, accidents in a nuclear plant do occur, and human factors are confirmed to be the prime cause of these accidents. Several studies have been carried out for human factor analysis, and still, there is a need for additional methods to model human errors. In this paper, human factor analysis and classification system (HFACS) is used to analyze the causal factors for an accident/incident. HFACS is a validated and reliable model for human factor analysis and provides a simple way to evaluate the causal factors in an accident. Although HFACS framework can be applied to analyze any accident events, in this paper, it is applied to review eighteen unintended reactor trip events due to human error from 2000 to 2006. In this study, experts analyze and rate the events against each hierarchal level in HFACS. Expert judgment is sought as the uncertainty and complexity involved in modeling human and organizational factors are very high. Homogeneity of experts is assessed using inter-rated reliability and Cohen's kappa value. Expert evaluation on human factors is quantified and based on the correlation in rating, most significant factor is identified. Further, based on the information on the reported events and the analysis, statistical tests are employed to confirm the associations between the hierarchal levels in the HFACS framework for reactor trip events. The results indicate four pairs of factors, viz. resource management, planned inappropriate actions, adverse mental states, and skill-based errors have strong associations between adjacent categories. Based on these associations, adverse mental states are deemed the most potent for accident occurrences. Further analysis indicated that slips of attention, memory failures for events such a failure to open or close the valves, and perception failures for visual illumination (i.e., 'skilled based errors') are the most common 'unsafe acts' committed and appear more frequently along with nuclear control room actions. The results reveal that human errors are caused mainly due to potential human factors associated with cognition. Few active failures are also identified. Thus, the analysis highlights the importance of attention toward possible human factors among others. Overall, HFACS tool proves useful in categorizing operator errors from reported events. HFACS framework and the quantification method help to determine which factors are more dominant and influential in the accident sequence and provide additional insight for the analysts into the significance and relative importance of each of the human factors.","[Karthick, M.; Kumar, C.

Through this work, we propose a new methodology to improve accuracy of facial expression recognition system even with the constraints like partial hidden faces or occlusions for real time applications. As a first step, seven independent facial segments: Full-Face, half-face (left/right), upper half face, lower half face, eyes, mouth and nose are considered to recognize facial expression. Unlike the work reported in literature, where arbitrarily generated patch type occlusions on facial regions are used, in this work a detailed analysis of each facial feature is explored. Using the results thus obtained, these seven sub models are combined using a Stacked Generalized ensemble method with deep neural network as meta-learner to improve accuracy of facial expression recognition system even in occluded state. The accuracy of the proposed model improved up to 30% compared to individual model accuracies for cross-corpus seven model datasets. The proposed system uses CNN with RPA compliance and is also configured on Raspberry Pi, which can be used for HRI and Industry 4.0 applications which involve face occlusion and partially hidden face challenges.","[Saxena, Suchitra; Tripathi, Shikha; Sudarshan, T.

Construction equipment operators' hazard perception error (HPE) has been recognized as one of the primary reasons for these accidents. Operators' hazard perception involves a series of cognitive functions that will change as the construction process evolves. Although the importance of hazard perception to construction equipment operating safety is widely recognized, the analysis and interpretation of its cognitive processes, potential cognitive failure modes, underlying causes, and dynamic characteristics involved has not been fully addressed. Furthermore, there is still a lack of an effective method to quantitatively assess HPE evolution and changes in corresponding cognitive states over time. This study combines a cognitive model and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) modeling to provide a qualitative and quantitative proactive analysis of operators' HPE. Considering the lack of prior knowledge of operators' HPE in the construction industry, computational models of several key cognitive functions and multiple information sources were integrated to determine the conditional probability distributions of the DBN nodes. The method's feasibility was validated with a case study. Researchers and practitioners may customize the model to quantify the occurrence tendency of operators' HPE under a specific construction condition to assist in proposing countermeasures to reduce and mitigate HPE.","[Li, Jue] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Jue; Li, Heng; Wang, Fan; Yang, Xincong] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Andy S.

Since time is usually scarce and the procedure can be highly variable, one solution for the companies can be the introduction of digital assistance systems. Hence, the focus of this contribution is the initial learning procedure of the assembly of a new and complex product. Therefore, a user study was conducted in close cooperation with an industrial partner to compare the traditional way of training to the self-paced learning with a digital assistance system. During the execution of the user study, objective data was recorded to allow precise measurements of the individual learning progress. Furthermore, the subjective learning experience was assessed using a customized questionnaire and a standardized task load metric.

Although current researches and methods can deal with the UAV safety problems well at some extent, the effectiveness of them is greatly reduced when the UAV is in a highly antagonism and harsh environment. In this work, the autonomous safety control method for the UAV system is researched and explored from the need of improving the operational security of UAV system. UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance refers to that the UAV can rely on perceptual and cognitive computing functions of the UAV system during the flight guidance to perceive and identify the forthcoming or ongoing security risks and to generate a correct evasion strategy. Cognition-guidance is a specific application of the cognitive computing. The safety connotation of the UAV and the research status of safety control are firstly analyzed, then, the relationship between the guidance and human cognition is discussed, and the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is proposed. Besides, the UAV anti-collision control strategy is designed, and taking the two UAVs anti-collision control mission as an example, the simulation research for the UAV safety control method based on cognition-guidance is studied. And the simulation results have proved that the method is effective.","[Huang, Hanqiao; Cheng, Haoyu] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Unmmaned Syst Inst, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Hanqiao; Zhou, Huan] Air Force Engn Univ, Aeronaut Engn Coll, Xian 710038, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Meiyun] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Air Force Engineering University; Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Huang, HQ (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Unmmaned Syst Inst, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Huang, HQ (corresponding author), Air Force Engn Univ, Aeronaut Engn Coll, Xian 710038, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",cnxahhq@126.com; kgy_zhouh@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61601505],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61601505),,11,0,0,0,18,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-2300-2,PROC SPIE,,,2018,10835,,,,,,,,UNSP 108351M,10.1117/12.2505430,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2505430,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Optics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Optics,BL5UO,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000452819500054,View Full Record in Web of Science

While robots ace at repetitive and monotonous assembly steps, humansare able to adapt flexibly to new situations and upcoming problems. Combining these advantages by means of direct human-robot cooperation seems to be interesting for producing companies but has not been realized yet. While the corresponding technologies are already available, appropriate safety standards to ensure occupational safety are missing and represent one of the main barriers for introducing direct human-robot cooperation. This paper describes the requirements for a workplace, where humans and robots jointly perform an assembly process without separation between their workspaces. The requirements are identified in line with an ergonomic workplace for different aged working persons, whereas the robot assists the human with the assembly process. The analysis considers technical, human-related, and normative requirements. Afterwards, an early implementation of the concept is presented based on a cognitively automated assembly system using a lightweight robot. (C) 2015 The Authors.

To bridge this research gap as well as to address organizational practitioners' concern in GHRM practices, our study explores the possible interactive effect of green compensation (GC) and green training (GT), which are two core practices of GHRM and are widely employed by Chinese organizations simultaneously, on EPEB drawing on self determination theory, and unravels the underlying mechanism by introducing employee green self-accountability (EGSA) as a mediator based on the cognitive dissonance theory of self standards. Methods: Using on-line survey and five-point Likert rating method, employees (N=847) working in Chinese organizations were requested to self-rate GC, GT, and EGSA; their direct supervisors were invited to evaluate EPEB. The mediated moderation testing procedures with SPSS and the bootstrapping approach with MPLUS were adopted to test the mediated moderation. Results: When being used separately, GC and GT are positively related to EPEB (13=0.426, p < 0.001; 13=0.368, p < 0.001). When being adopted simultaneously, a negative relationship (the simple slope=-0.454, t=3.671, p=0.000) exists between GC and EPEB at higher-level GT. EGSA partially mediates the negative interaction with 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals [-0.054, -0.018]. Conclusion: In the Chinese context, when being used simultaneously with high-high combination, GC and GT negatively interact with each other to engender the squeezed effect of intrinsic motivation by extrinsic motivation, which directly impairs EPEB, and cause employee cognitive dissonance of self-standards, which indirectly weakens EPEB through reducing EGSA. This paper is an attempt to show novelty in identifying negative interactions between GC and GT in EPEB in China and a mediating role of EGSA. Additionally, it addresses organizational practitioners' concern well and provides important implications for decision-making in GHRM practices and EPEB enhancement.","[Zhang, Haiyan] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Business Sch, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Shuwei] Xuzhou Univ Technol, Sch Math & Stat, 2 Lishui Rd, Xuzhou 221111, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangsu Normal University; Xuzhou University of Technology,"Sun, SW (corresponding author), Xuzhou Univ Technol, Sch Math & Stat, 2 Lishui Rd, Xuzhou 221111, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ssw@xzit.edu.cn,"Zhang, Haiyan/JDW-4989-2023","Zhang, Haiyan/0000-0002-5110-2811",Social Sciences Research Project of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [18YJC630238]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72132003],Social Sciences Research Project of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Social Sciences Research Project of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (Grant Number 18YJC630238) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 72132003).,,68,7,7,9,60,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",1179-1578,,,PSYCHOL RES BEHAV MA,Psychol.

While Artificial intelligence is a simulation of the cognitive approach, RPA is merely mimicking that process by the use of bots. RPA and IA are emerging and transforming bus inesses across various sectors such as finance and accounting, payroll, human resources, supply chain, customer service, sales and marketing, IT etc.[5] One such industry where bots are being used for automating processes is the food and lifestyle industry. Various applications like healthify me and room suggest users a diet based on their specifications like height, weight, age, gender etc. Some of these applications make use of E-mail automation to suggest users with a user-specific, specially curated diet at timed intervals(daily/weekly/ monthly..). Various tools such as Automation Anywhere, Blue prism, UI-Path, Pega etc.[4] are used to create bots and automate tasks/compute algorithms. The tool used for the creation of this diet recommendation system is Automation Anywhere. By making use of automation anywhere, a recommender system is created that can act as a meal planner. There are three types of bots in Automation Anywhere - task bots, meta bots and IQ bots. Task bots need to be edited manually with application updates. Metabots on the other hand, are more advanced. They are designed in such a way that bot-recalibration is automatically applied with changes in the application interface. IQ bots use cognitive technology when working with unstructured data[11]. Here, For this particular application, taskbots and metabots are used. The proposed solution is capable of sending a large number of diet recommendations to hundreds of users in a database at a very expeditious rate.","[Vasireddy, Prithvi] VR Siddartha Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Vijayawada, India",Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering College,"Vasireddy, P (corresponding author), VR Siddartha Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Vijayawada, India.",,,,,,,,1,1,1,1,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-4876-2,,,,2020,,,,,,,449,454,,10.1109/iciccs48265.2020.9121120,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iciccs48265.2020.9121120,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science,BQ5ZQ,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000609825100077,View Full Record in Web of Science

It plays an important role in attracting, retaining and motivating employees to promote breakthrough innovation. Based on the input-process-output (I-P-O) model, this paper examines the relationship between team idiosyncratic deals and team breakthrough innovation, the mediating role of team exploratory-exploitative knowledge sharing, and the moderating roles of team transactive memory systems and team cognitive flexibility. Participants and methodsIn order to reduce the effects of common method biases and causal lag effect, this study is divided into three stages for data collection, with a time interval of 1 month. Eighty teams (406 employees) from six enterprises in Shanghai and Hangzhou were selected as samples, and the hypothesis test was carried out by hierarchical regression analysis, bootstrap, and Johnson-Neyman method. ResultsThe results show that higher team idiosyncratic deals are associated with higher team breakthrough innovation through higher team exploratory-exploitative knowledge sharing, and that team transactive memory systems and team cognitive flexibility positively moderate the mediating effect of team exploratory-exploitative knowledge sharing in the relationship between team idiosyncratic deals and team breakthrough innovation in the first stage and the second stage, respectively. Under the joint effect of high team transactive memory systems and high team cognitive flexibility, the mediating effect of team exploratory-exploitative knowledge sharing is stronger. ConclusionThe research results break through the previous research framework of social exchange theory, and I-P-O model to explore the influence mechanism of team idiosyncratic deals, in order to promote the sustainable growth of team breakthrough innovation through this non-standard work arrangement. It is hoped that this research can inspire modern enterprises to create team idiosyncratic deals for valuable teams engaged in breakthrough innovation, which are more conducive to give full play to their heterogeneous talents, and finally help enterprises break through the industry bottleneck and win the market competition.","[Fan, Zili; Sun, Hao; Wang, Lijun; Peng, Ting] Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Mengting] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Technology; Shanghai University,"Zhu, MT (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jocelemy@163.com,,,Research Fund Project of Hubei University of Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Hubei Provincial Social Science Foundation of China; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; [XJ2021008601]; [71804043]; [20ZD041]; [19YJCZH125],"Research Fund Project of Hubei University of Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hubei Provincial Social Science Foundation of China; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); ; ; ;","Funding This work was supported by the Research Fund Project of Hubei University of Technology (XJ2021008601), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71804043), the Hubei Provincial Social Science Foundation of China (20ZD041), and the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (19YJCZH125).",,39,1,1,6,52,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

These representations exhibit diverse degrees of human-likeness, serving different functions and objectives. Despite these variations, they share common features, particularly facial attributes that serve as building blocks for facial expressions-an effective means of communicating emotions. To provide a unified conceptualization for this broad spectrum of face representations, we propose the term facial icons drawing upon Peirce's semiotic concepts. Additionally, based on these semiotic principles, we posit that facial icons function as indexes of emotions and intentions, and introduce a significant anthropological theory aligning with our proposition. Subsequently, we support our assertions by examining processes related to face and facial expression perception, as well as sensorimotor simulation processes involved in discerning others' mental states, including emotions. Our argumentation integrates cognitive and experimental evidence, reinforcing the pivotal role of facial icons in conveying mental states.","[Achour-Benallegue, Amel] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Augmentat Res Ctr, Cognit Environm & Commun Res Team, Kashiwa, Japan; [Pelletier, Jerome] PSL Univ, Inst Jean Nicod, Dept Etud Cognit, EHESS,ENS,CNRS, Paris, France; [Pelletier, Jerome] Univ Western Brittany, Dept Philosophy, Brest, France; [Kaminski, Gwenael] Univ Toulouse, Cognit Langues Langage Ergon, Toulouse, France; [Kaminski, Gwenael] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Kawabata, Hideaki] Keio Univ, Fac Letters, Dept Psychol, Tokyo, Japan",National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Universite de Toulouse; Institut Universitaire de France; Keio University,"Achour-Benallegue, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Augmentat Res Ctr, Cognit Environm & Commun Res Team, Kashiwa, Japan.",a.achour.benallegue@gmail.com,"Kaminski, Gwenael/AAA-4214-2021; Kaminski, Gwenael/G-6394-2010","Kaminski, Gwenael/0000-0001-5300-5655",,,,,121,0,0,8,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

However, the resource and communication shortages of a single mobile device make it insufficient in providing high quality of experience (QoE), especially in satisfying the real-time and interactive constraints. Recently, considerable research has addressed these problems, and the proposed systems take advantage of collaborative mobile computing which benefits mobile devices in terms of computing capability, battery life, latency, and data usage. In this survey, we pay our attention to collaborative multi-device computation, and discuss the QoE guarantee, user incentives and other challenges that exit in this area. We also study the networking technologies that can be utilized in multi-device collaboration.

This study investigates the effect of conceptual and perceptual biases on similarity bias in multiple target visual searches and proposes relevant design strategies that can be applied to warning interfaces. The results of two experiments show that the effect of the similarity bias is due to the combined effects of conceptual and perceptual similarities, and on this basis, we propose a design strategy for the interface of a gas extraction monitoring system used in mines in a third experiment. An existing interface to monitor gas extraction and a proposed interface with modifications made to the existing interface are evaluated. The results confirm that the modified interface effectively improves visual search performance during multiple target visual searches. The research findings are important for reducing cognitive decision errors during related monitoring work and ensuring the performance of the mine gas safety monitoring system interfaces.

We address this through an interview study in the high-tech industry to compare and contrast the concerns of these two roles. We found that the importance of clarifying position requirements and assessing candidates as whole individuals are commonly discussed by both recruiters and job seekers. In contrast, while recruiters tended to be more aware of cognitive bias and desired more tool support during interviews, job seekers voiced more desire towards a healthy candidate-company relationship. Additionally, both roles considered the uncertainty of the current technology capability and reduced human contact as concerns for using automated tools.

Therefore the proposed architecture is based on dividing the management for the high-level on a computer or server and for the low-level directly on the mobile robot.

Unfortunately, currently not all the robots are accessible for all users. This is due to the different characteristics of users, as users with visual, hearing, motor or cognitive disabilities were not considered during the design, implementation or interaction phase, causing accessibility barriers to users who have limitations. This research presents a proposal for accessibility guidelines for human-robot interaction (HRI). The guidelines have been evaluated by seventeen HRI designers and/or developers. A questionnaire of nine five-point Likert Scale questions and 6 open-ended questions was developed to evaluate the proposed guidelines for developers and designers, in terms of four main factors: usability, social acceptance, user experience and social impact. The questions act as indicators for each factor. The majority (15 of 17 participants) agreed that the guidelines are helpful for them to design and implement accessible robot interfaces and applications.

In this context, existing offline methodologies do not account for the variability of human actions and states; therefore, planning and dynamically assigning roles in human-robot teams remains an unaddressed challenge. This study aims to create an ergonomic role allocation framework that optimises the HRC, taking into account task features and human state measurements. The presented framework consists of two main modules: the first provides the HRC task model, exploiting AND/OR Graphs (AOG)s, which we adapted to solve the allocation problem; the second module describes the ergonomic risk assessment during task execution through a risk indicator and updates the AOG-related variables to influence future task allocation. The proposed framework can be combined with any time-varying ergonomic risk indicator that evaluates human cognitive and physical burden. In this work, we tested our framework in an assembly scenario, introducing a risk index named Kinematic Wear. The overall framework has been tested with a multi-subject experiment. The task allocation results and subjective evaluations, measured with questionnaires, show that high-risk actions are correctly recognised and not assigned to humans, reducing fatigue and frustration in collaborative tasks.","[Merlo, Elena; Lamon, Edoardo; Fusaro, Fabio; Lorenzini, Marta; Ajoudani, Arash] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Human Robot Interfaces & Interact, Genoa, Italy; [Carfi, Alessandro; Mastrogiovanni, Fulvio] Univ Genoa, Dept Informat Bioengn Robot & Syst Engn, Genoa, Italy; [Fusaro, Fabio] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy",Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; University of Genoa; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Lamon, E (corresponding author), Ist Italiano Tecnol, Human Robot Interfaces & Interact, Genoa, Italy.",edoardo.lamon@iit.it,"Carfì, Alessandro/ABE-4767-2020; Lamon, Edoardo/HSF-4729-2023","Fusaro, Fabio/0000-0002-3909-7941; Carfi, Alessandro/0000-0001-9208-6910; Lamon, Edoardo/0000-0002-5526-2337; Merlo, Elena/0009-0000-2205-0568",European Research Council's (ERC) [GA 850932]; European Union [GA 101016007],European Research Council's (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union(European Union (EU)),This work was supported in part by the European Research Council's (ERC) starting grant Ergo-Lean (GA 850932) and in part by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program CONCERT (GA 101016007).,,44,12,12,14,46,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

An Internet-based self-report survey battery utilizing a four-stage preparation method was used as the primary data collection tool. Research was conducted in the health care industry (N=207). Linear, simultaneous, and mediated regression analyses were used to examine the variables of interest. Results suggested that participation in HRD practices and cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement were negatively related to turnover intent. Mediated regression analyses indicated that engagement partially mediated the relation between HRD practices and turnover intent.

This increase in the real estate sector is not ecologically sustainable because harmful materials are used for the environment and health, in addition to the use of machinery that uses fossil fuel. The objective of this research is to determine what would be the new regulations of environmental management in the building systems for the buildings of La Aurora by reviewing the pollutants that throw the materials most used in construction in order to establish the margins of contamination allowed and the means to compensate for the damage created. To determine the new regulations, a scenario analysis combined with neutrosophical cognitive maps and the TOPSIS multicriteria method is used. This combination allows analyzing the main scenarios and ordering them according to the multiple dimensions of the problem.

Virtualization is the opposite action: we pass real object into the user interface, it disappears, and we get a virtual object on the screen. Our experiment included a grocery shop game with a coin machine as an input-output device. The virtual money that was earned in the game was realized as metal coins. The metal coins paid into the user interface were represented virtually on the computer screen. The experiment included two ages groups: adults and children 6-8 years old. Reference groups played the same game without tangible components, i.e. all the money in the game was virtual (a common implementation in the game industry). Adults bought less products in the version with tangible interface, and the decision period was longer in that case. The children's results were completely different: they bought many more products when playing the game with the tangible interface (about 3 times more).

The 20th century saw tremendous industrial developments based on tangible materials that were transformed and assembled to make washing machines, cars, aircraft and power plants; during its last three decades, electronics and software were incrementally added to hardwaremachines. Operationalization issuesmoved fromhardware to software, making automation and user interfaces central issues. From the beginning of the 21st century, we began to do the exact opposite! Currently, we typically start a project by designing and developing technology on computers, using software only, which is later transformed into hardware (and software). I denote this shift, the 'socio-technical inversion'. Operationalization issues are moving from software to hardware, making tangibility a central issue. Three useful conceptualmodels are presented: the SFAC (Structure/Function versus Abstract/Concrete) model; the NAIR (Natural/Artificial versus Cognitive/Physical) model; and the AUTOS (Artifact, User, Task, Organization and Situation) pyramid.

The implementation of hard lean practices alone worsens workers' Quality of Work Life (QWL) which results in obtaining anticipated long-term lean performance. To promote the adaptation of soft lean practices, the study aimed to highlight the significance of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) in lean performance and sustainability through structural equation modelling using survey data from 168 experts involved in lean environments. The study documented that the degree of lean performance is positively related to HFE. Also, it found that psychosocial and physical factors influence lean performance enhancement more than others do whereas cognitive factors influence them the least. The study will help managers and researchers understand the relationship between HFE and lean performance and thus help to solve human-related issues in a lean environment and lean system design for successful implementation.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is poised to play a prominent role in modern work environments, especially a collaborative environment where humans and machines work in close proximity, often with physical contact. In a physical human robot collaboration (pHRC), the robot performs complex motion sequences. Any unexpected robot behavior or faulty interaction might raise safety concerns. Error-related potentials, naturally generated by the brain when a human partner perceives an error, have been extensively employed in BCI as implicit human feedback to adapt robot behavior to facilitate a safe and intuitive interaction. However, the integration of BCI technology with error-related potential for robot control demands failure-free integration of highly uncertain electroencephalography (EEG) signals, particularly influenced by the physical and cognitive state of the user. As a higher workload on the user compromises their access to cognitive resources needed for error awareness, it is crucial to study how mental workload variations impact the error awareness as it might raise safety concerns in pHRC. In this study, we aim to study how cognitive workload affects the error awareness of a human user engaged in a pHRC. Approach. We designed a blasting task with an abrasive industrial robot and manipulated the mental workload with a secondary arithmetic task of varying difficulty. EEG data, perceived workload, task and physical performance were recorded from 24 participants moving the robot arm. The error condition was achieved by the unexpected stopping of the robot in 33% of trials. Main results. We observed a diminished amplitude for the prediction error negativity (PEN) and error positivity (Pe), indicating reduced error awareness with increasing mental workload. We further observed an increased frontal theta power and increasing trend in the central alpha and central beta power after the unexpected robot stopping compared to when the robot stopped correctly at the target. We also demonstrate that a popular convolution neural network model, EEGNet, could predict the amplitudes of PEN and Pe from the EEG data prior to the error. Significance. This prediction model could be instrumental in developing an online prediction model that could forewarn the system and operators of the diminished error awareness of the user, alluding to a potential safety breach in error-related potential-based BCI system for pHRC. Therefore, our work paves the way for embracing BCI technology in pHRC to optimally adapt the robot behavior for personalized user experience using real-time brain activity, enriching the quality of the interaction.","[John, Alka Rachel; Singh, Avinash K.; Lin, Chin-Teng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australian Artificial Intelligence Inst, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, Australia; [Gramann, Klaus] TU Berlin, Dept Biol Psychol & Neuroergon, Berlin, Germany; [Liu, Dikai] Univ Technol Sydney, Robot Inst, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; Technical University of Berlin; University of Technology Sydney,"John, AR (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Australian Artificial Intelligence Inst, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, Australia.",alkarachel.john@student.uts.edu.au,"Gramann, Klaus/AAD-7313-2019; Singh, Avinash/Y-3119-2019; Lin, Chin-Teng (CT)/G-8129-2017","Singh, Avinash/0000-0002-6539-9695; Lin, Chin-Teng (CT)/0000-0001-8371-8197",Australian Research Councilhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923,Australian Research Councilhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923,No Statement Available,,77,0,0,10,17,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1741-2560,1741-2552,,J NEURAL ENG,J.

However, construction tasks requiring dexterity remain a challenge due to the need for precise movements, accurate perception, real-time decision-making, and a comprehensive understanding of the environment. To address these challenges, the introduction of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents a significant shift in robotic capabilities to enhance their alignment with the broader spectrum of construction settings. Rooted in cognitive science, embodied AI emphasizes the integration of an agent's physical form into its computational intelligence processes. It resembles how humans develop motor skills by interacting with physical world. This paper introduces DEXBOT, an exploratory framework for designing construction robots capable of high dexterity using embodied AI principles that mimics human strategies in complex tasks. The framework outlines six key perspectives for solving high-dexterity tasks with embodied AI: scene understanding, localization and motion planning, position-based control, force-based control, sequence planning, and correction decision-making. By presenting preliminary test cases for each perspective, the paper emphasizes the role of embodied AI in advancing dexterity level of construction robots. The DEXBOT framework is expected to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration of designing capable construction robots in the future.","[You, Hengxu; Zhou, Tianyu; Ye, Yang] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 454A Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Zhu, Qi] Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Boulder, CO 08305 USA; [Du, Eric Jing] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Zhu, Q (corresponding author), Natl Inst Stand & Technol, Boulder, CO 08305 USA.;Du, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",you.h@ufl.edu; zhoutianyu@ufl.edu; qi.zhu@nist.gov; ye.yang@ufl.edu; eric.du@essie.ufl.edu,"Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024; You, Hengxu/IZE-7339-2023; Zhou, Tianyu/IYJ-7379-2023","Ye, Yang/0000-0003-0101-5290",National Science Foundation (NSF) [2024784],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant 2024784.

Exploring the convergence of humanoid artificial intelligence, the communities of Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence of Things, and the Machine Learners align their goals into integrating both physical and virtual worlds which opens a lot of opportunity in human and robot interaction. Anthropomorphic robots are built with the grandiose objective of emulating human form and function, serving an extensive spectrum of purposes in a variety of industries and applications. Its utility encompasses nearly everything from assistance and companionship to industrial and recreational applications. Humanoid devices are capable of being an aid in the realm of healthcare such as therapeutic activities, featuring tailored care and support towards people experiencing physical constraints or impairments. These robots can undertake difficult endeavors with dexterity in the manufacturing process, enhancing efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize education by functioning as interactive instructors as well as companions for people who are subjected to difficulties with learning. These robotics' potential goes further towards responding to catastrophic instances, where its handiness and versatility allow it to venture into complicated areas, analyze factors, and conduct operations that humans may deem hazardous. Artificially intelligent humanoids ought to be able to consistently acquire knowledge and adjust to shifting circumstances. This implies utilizing reinforcement learning to improve performance and responsiveness over time by refining its actions. Anthropoid robots' adaptability markets them as vital instruments with a likelihood to augment human abilities as they confront a multitude of challenges across various domains. These humanoid robots are designed to take the form and function of a human thus serving as the physical embodiment of adaptable intelligent systems. The cognitive abilities and adaptive learning of a humanoid robot are to be explained in this paper, as well as the intricate details of how machine learning techniques influence the robots' capacity to learn from experiences and dynamically respond to perplexing surroundings. As technology progresses, the attempt to create increasingly accurate humanoid robots propels the boundaries of what is plausible, establishing not only an insight into the future but also a mirror of the nuances that constitute our own humanity. Constructing a humanoid robot that is capable of functioning as a human necessitates working with a complex web of aspects involving mechanics, artificial intelligence, and neurological mechanisms. In order to accomplish a robot that resembles anthropomorphic movement, a proficient mechanical craftsmanship must be developed. Humanoid robots must replicate the human body's versatility in motion, mobility of joints, and precision. The aforementioned entails using cutting-edge materials and exquisite engineering to simulate the subtleties of human freedom of movement, spanning delicate motor ability to seamless propulsion. For a humanoid robot to navigate and interact with its environment, advanced sensory mechanisms must be integrated. Furthermore, not only its vision equipment should perceive surroundings, whereas it must also recognize imagery and depth perception. Sensors that measure tactile sensations convey signals for sensitive interactions and object maneuvering by portraying the human sense of contact. For the purpose of allowing accurate movement coordination, kinesthesia is adapted. In imitation of human cognitive functions, human-like robots depend on advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. This comprehensive abstract offers a wide-ranging overview of the present state and future possibilities of humanoid robots. It emerges into the tremendous mechanical capabilities, revolutionary intellectual developments, interaction between humans and robots' dynamics, and the stimulating perspectives that stretch beyond. Humanoid robots, as an embodiment of intelligence, occupy a key position where technology progress meets societal development. The subject matter is an immersion account about humanity's ongoing attempt at developing intelligent devices that precisely replicate while gaining insight on the complexities of human existence. The futuristic frontiers of humanoid robotics are to be explored throughout the study, envisioning a world in which these machines serve critical roles in the fields of space exploration, healthcare, education, and several other fields. Humanoid robots, as technology improves, possess the ability to revolutionize our view of human and machine interdependence, not solely as tools, but as essential contributors to our society. This concept probes into the terrain of collaborative robotics, focusing on the synergistic interaction that exists between mankind and humanoid robots. This relationship includes more than just physical assistance; it also includes an integrated intellect that boosts innovative thinking, troubleshooting, and effectiveness. The prospective societal impact of humanoid robots in harmonious roles reckon a more secure work environment, improved output, and job role reconfiguration in an array of industries. In the department of Artificial Intelligence of Things, humanoid robots serve as autonomous components, traversing real world settings while interfacing networks. The ability of these machines to process real-time data, interpret environmental cues, and communicate with other IoT devices, alongside improving linked system performance, also incorporates a more unified and responsive IoT community. Concurrently, humanoid robots also act as digital characters, embodying individuals in virtual places, bridging the gap between actual existence and the Metaverse. Such physicality offers a newchannel for immersive interactions, permitting users to gain access to the Metaverse bymeans of the eyes of humanoid substitutes, facilitating a more cohesive consolidation of physical and virtual realities.","[Valenzuela, Kirsten Lynx; Roxas, Samantha Isabel; Wong, Yung-Hao] Minghsin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Hsinchu 30401, Taiwan",,"Wong, YH (corresponding author), Minghsin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Hsinchu 30401, Taiwan.",yvonwong@must.edu.tw,"Wong, Yung-Hao/E-9450-2010",,,,,,6,0,0,11,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2945-9133,1611-3349,978-3-031-60614-4; 978-3-031-60615-1,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2024,14736,,,,,,295,303,,10.1007/978-3-031-60615-1_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-60615-1_20,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX3JE,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001281288800020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Background: The STOM model predicts that in overload, tasks will be switched to, to the extent that they are attractive on task attributes of high priority, interest, and salience and low difficulty. But more-difficult tasks are less likely to be switched away from once they are being performed. Method: In Experiment 1, participants performed four tasks of the Multi-Attribute Task Battery and provided task-switching data to inform the role of difficulty and priority. In Experiment 2, participants concurrently performed an environmental control task and a robotic arm simulation. Workload was varied by automation of arm movement and both the phases of environmental control and existence of decision support for fault management. Attention to the two tasks was measured using a head tracker. Results: Experiment 1 revealed the lack of influence of task priority and confirmed the differing roles of task difficulty. In Experiment 2, the percentage attention allocation across the eight conditions was predicted by the STOM model when participants rated the four attributes. Model predictions were compared against empirical data and accounted for over 95% of variance in task allocation. More-difficult tasks were performed longer than easier tasks. Task priority does not influence allocation. Conclusions: The multiattribute decision model provided a good fit to the data. Applications: The STOM model is useful for predicting cognitive tunneling given that human-in-the-loop simulation is time-consuming and expensive.","[Wickens, Christopher Dow; Sebok, Angelia] Alion Sci & Technol, Boulder, CO USA; [Gutzwiller, Robert S.] Space & Naval Warfare Syst Ctr Pacific, San Diego, CA USA; [Vieane, Alex; Janes, Jess] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Clegg, Benjamin A.] Colorado State Univ, Cognit Psychol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific; Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Wickens, CD (corresponding author), Alion Sci & Technol, Boulder, CO USA.;Wickens, CD (corresponding author), Alion Sci, 4949 Pearl East Circle,Suite 300, Boulder, CO 80301 USA.",cwickens@alionscience.com,"Gutzwiller, Robert/W-8800-2019",,"NASA [NNX12AE69G]; Department of Defense SMART scholarship through Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific; NASA [NNX12AE69G, 75074] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Department of Defense SMART scholarship through Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific(United States Department of Defense); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This material is based upon work supported by NASA under Grant NNX12AE69G, technical monitors Dr. Brian Gore, Dr. Sandra Whitmire, and Dr. Jessica Marquez.

Since unwanted LNG release may lead to severe consequences, performing quantitative risk assessment (QRA) for LNG bunkering operations has become mandatory according to some regulations. Human error is a main contributor to the risks, and the human error probabilities (HEPs) are essential for inclusion in a QRA. However, HEPs data are unavailable in the LNG bunkering industry so far. Therefore, this study attempts to infer HEPs through on-site safety philosophical factors (SPFs). The cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) was adopted as a basic model and modified to make it suitable for HEP assessment in LNG bunkering. Nine common performance condition (CPC) indicators were identified based on the fuzzy ranking of 23 SPF indicators (SPFIs). A Bayesian network (BN) was built to simulate the occurrence probabilities of different contextual control modes (COCOMs), and a conditional probability table (CPT) for the COCOM node with 19,683 possible combinations in the BN was developed according to the CREAM's COCOM matrix. The prior probabilities of CPCs were evaluated using the fuzzy set theory (FST) based on data acquired from an online questionnaire survey. The results showed that the prior HEP for LNG bunkering is 0.009841. This value can be updated based on the re-evaluation of on-site SPFIs for a specific LNG bunkering project to capture the dynamics of HEP. The main innovation of this work is realizing the efficient quantification of HEP for LNG bunkering operations by using the proposed fuzzy BN-CREAM model.","[Fan, Hongjun; Enshaei, Hossein; Jayasinghe, Shantha Gamini] Univ Tasmania, Australian Maritime Coll AMC, Coll Sci & Engn, Launceston, Tas 7248, Australia",University of Tasmania; Australian Maritime College,"Fan, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Australian Maritime Coll AMC, Coll Sci & Engn, Launceston, Tas 7248, Australia.",Hongjun.fan@utas.edu.au; Hossein.enshaei@utas.edu.au; Shantha.jayasinghe@utas.edu.au,"Fan, Hongjun/ABM-8474-2022; enshaei, hossein/J-7758-2014","Enshaei, Hossein/0000-0002-5649-7015; Fan, Hongjun/0000-0002-2808-3624",,,,,69,21,21,12,65,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

The current trend toward large collaborative research and development projects across institutions and organizations, and between the academy and industry, is analyzed and reviewed in the context of visualization research. A number of typical applications in interactive data visualization are presented, while recognizing the limitations of presenting these solely in a written and visual format when their power is normally in real-time interactive exploration. Aspects of current research and development in visual analytics are presented and compared with those in scientific visualization and information visualization. The question of whether visual analytics has subsumed the areas of information visualization and scientific visualization is considered. Possible future directions for visual analytics are explored.","[Earnshaw, Rae] Univ Bradford, Ctr Visual Comp, Fac Engn & Informat, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England; [Earnshaw, Rae] Univ Durham, St Johns Coll, Durham, England; [Earnshaw, Rae] Wrexham Glyndwr Univ, Fac Arts Sci & Technol, Wrexham, Wales",University of Bradford; Durham University,"Earnshaw, R (corresponding author), Univ Bradford, Ctr Visual Comp, Fac Engn & Informat, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England.;Earnshaw, R (corresponding author), Univ Durham, St Johns Coll, Durham, England.;Earnshaw, R (corresponding author), Wrexham Glyndwr Univ, Fac Arts Sci & Technol, Wrexham, Wales.",,"Earnshaw, Rae/G-8917-2013",,,,,,24,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG LONDON LTD,GODALMING,"SWEETAPPLE HOUSE CATTESHALL RD FARNCOMBE, GODALMING GU7 1NH, SURREY, ENGLAND",1610-3947,,978-3-030-24367-8; 978-3-030-24366-1,ADV INFORM KNOWL PRO,,,2019,,,,,,,73,91,,10.1007/978-3-030-24367-8_6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-24367-8_6,10.1007/978-3-030-24367-8,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Computer Science,BN8MA,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000488075500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Personality tests attract through optimistic descriptions and ease of use for individual and team development while often lacking predictive and discriminant validities. Despite those concerns, the personality-testing market can be characterized as a dynamic industry, with many professionals using assessments in developmental settings such as management training and executive coaching. The aim of this article is to explore how individual meaning-making and organizational sensemaking theories help to explain the widespread and sustained use of personality tests in developmental contexts among HRD professionals. Using grounded theory and inductive analysis, we distill meaning from semistructured interviews with 18 HRD professionals. Through pattern analysis, we establish six strategies that describe practical approaches in personality testing: 1. Ethical-protective, 2. Scientific-selective, 3. Cautious-avoiding, 4. Cautious-embracing, 5. User friendly-pragmatic, and 6. Knowledgeable-accommodating. We find that HRD professionals deal with cognitive dissonances and paradoxical situations in their professional personality test use practice on a regular basis.

Researchers and scientists want to have human like intelligent robots which are self-aware and self-motivated. Motivational robots are autonomous and intelligent which can set goals and then take actions to achieve their goals independently. Moreover, intelligence in robots is not possible without autonomy and autonomy is incorporated in robots through motivation. Nowadays, attention is being paid to build robots which have computational and energy autonomy. In Literature, various motivational architectures have been presented but none seems to focus on the development of human inspired motivation in robots comprehensively. These architectures try to achieve mere functional motivation in limited way, some considered only time for the regulation of drives, others failed to incorporate physiological and psychological aspects of human motivation. To the best of our knowledge, no architecture is truly based on the physiology and psychology of humans has been considered in the literature. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a motivational architecture for autonomous robots to make them independent in deciding the goals and taking actions. The proposed architecture is primarily based on physiology and psychology of human motivation through basic human drives (hunger, thirst and sleep), emotions and glucose-insulin theories. The whole process of drives regulation is based on stimulation and satiation. The intensity of the drives and the emotional states help in setting the goal and accordingly a suitable action is taken to meet the particular goal. Empirical results show that glucose and insulin have direct relationship with basic drives and emotions in the process of intrinsic motivation generation. The proposed architecture has applications in industry, education and autonomous robots. The proposed motivational architecture has significant advantages over several state-of-the-art architectures in terms of autonomy through intrinsic motivation.","[Khan, Ahmad Saeed; Anwar, Adeem Ali] Univ Lahore, Dept CS & IT, Lahore, Pakistan; [Azeem, Kiran] Univ Lahore, Dept SE, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Lahore; University of Lahore,"Khan, AS (corresponding author), Univ Lahore, Dept CS & IT, Lahore, Pakistan.",ahmad.saeed@cs.uol.edu.pk; adeem.anwar@cs.uol.edu.pk; kiran.azeem@se.uol.edu.pk,,"Anwar, Adeem Ali/0000-0002-6474-3810; Khan, Ahmad Saeed/0000-0002-9341-7803",,,,,18,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1864-5909,1864-5917,,EVOL INTELL,Evol.

Among all the technologies that have emerged over the years, information technology is the one that truly revolutionized the modern lifestyle. To take information technology beyond information mining and communication, intelligence technology (InT) is required to manipulate the information and knowledge with human-like intelligence. However, transforming InT into the next technological wave requires a medium to actualize InT with all its potential. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligence super agent (iSA) as an autonomous entity equipped with all categories of intelligence, i.e. cognitive, social, behavioral, ambient, collective, and genetic intelligences. To realize the iSA, we also present a modular architecture, named intelligence operating architecture (iOA), capable of implementing all aspects of InT along with a biologically-inspired thought process. As a novel implementation platform for the iSA, we present user-centered development of robots enacted through agent based modularization (UDREAM). The effectiveness of UDREAM is shown through some application-specific experiments with individual robots. Although the current iSA is for a limited number of services with a standalone robot, it can be extended to a more complex iSA.","[Kim, Jong-Hwan; Zaheer, Sheir Afgen; Choi, Seung-Hwan] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, JH (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",,"Choi, Seunghwan/KGL-5439-2024; Kim, Jong-Hwan/C-1969-2011",,"MOTIE (The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy), Korea [10045252]","MOTIE (The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy), Korea","This research was supported by the MOTIE (The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy), Korea, under the Technology Innovation Program supervised by KEIT (Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology) (10045252, Development of robot task intelligence technology).",,33,4,4,0,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1556-603X,1556-6048,,IEEE COMPUT INTELL M,IEEE Comput.

To achieve this, we used an 8- channel wearable EEG headset (Fp1, Fp2, Fz, C3, C4, Pz, O1, O2) to establish a personal database. It is primarily used to classify the intention for left or right eyes movement, allowing the subject to control the drone's direction. The model was applied during real-time testing. The data underwent preprocessing using a bandpass filter. The system recorded the subject's relaxed EEG data for 10 seconds to establish a baseline, which was subsequently used to determine the related drone commands. After the drone took off automatically, we recorded and analyzed the brainwave state every 3 seconds. We then transmitted the corresponding action commands to the DJI Tello drone to control its movements. Currently, we have designed seven different action commands based on EEG data for drone movements, including forward, backward, upward, downward, leftward, rightward, and landing. The accuracy of control commands is approximately 70%. The system aims to create a drone system that is operable by anyone. It is expected that this system can be applied to fields such as neurorehabilitation, exoskeleton manipulation, and the defense industry in the future.","[Lu, Pei-Shin] Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Biomed Engn, Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan; [Ko, Li-Wei] Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Elect & Control Engn, Ctr Intelligent Drug Syst & Smart Biodevices IDS2, Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan; [Ko, Li-Wei] Kaohsiung Med Univ, Drug Dev & Value Creat Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 807378, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Kaohsiung Medical University,"Ko, LW (corresponding author), Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Elect & Control Engn, Ctr Intelligent Drug Syst & Smart Biodevices IDS2, Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan.;Ko, LW (corresponding author), Kaohsiung Med Univ, Drug Dev & Value Creat Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 807378, Taiwan.",psluckye33.nel@gmail.com; lwko@nycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2325-0925,,979-8-3503-5989-3; 979-8-3503-5988-6,INT CONF SYST SCI EN,,,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/ICSSE61472.2024.10608858,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSSE61472.2024.10608858,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BX5DO,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001297793900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Each participant was involved in two 4-h shifts: a manual assembly setting and a HRC one. The response variables collected in the study included self-reported affective state, perceived body discomfort, perceived workload, physiological signals for stress (i.e., heart rate variability and electrodermal activity), process and product defectiveness. Experimental results showed less upper limb exertion in the HRC setting, emphasizing the contribution of cobots in improving physical ergonomics in repetitive processes. Furthermore, results showed reduced mental effort, stress, and fewer process defects in the HRC setting, highlighting how collaborative robotics can improve process quality by supporting operators from a cognitive point of view in repetitive processes.","[Gervasi, Riccardo; Capponi, Matteo; Mastrogiacomo, Luca; Franceschini, Fiorenzo] Politecn Torino, DIGEP Dept Management & Prod Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Franceschini, F (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, DIGEP Dept Management & Prod Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",riccardo.gervasi@polito.it; matteo.capponi@polito.it; luca.mastrogiacomo@polito.it; fiorenzo.franceschini@polito.it,"Gervasi, Riccardo/KHE-3109-2024; Franceschini, Fiorenzo/C-2583-2013","CAPPONI, MATTEO/0000-0002-4669-2140; Gervasi, Riccardo/0000-0002-3006-3382; Mastrogiacomo, Luca/0000-0002-8454-5918","Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca Award [TESUN-83486178370409, CAP. 1694 TIT. 232 ART. 6]","Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca Award","Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

IoMT is comprised of certain potentiality for the revolution in the healthcare industry. IoMT is associated with caregivers, healthcare providers, patients, and wearable sensors with software and ICT. The healthcare industry is also a well-known expanding market that has huge demands. It ensures the potential services towards the patients and also provides its contributions to the profits of the health sector. According to the technical advancements, a healthcare system must be developed based on decision-making capacity. Numerous researchers have also focused on involving cognitive behavior in IoT technology. Thus, in this paper, a new smart healthcare system with the help of loT devices is suggested. Initially, the data is collected from IoMT devices, which are fed to further processing. Secondly, the data pre-processing is carried out to remove the corrupted data and for removing the noise from the data. Thirdly, the features are collected from the pre-processed data through wavelet entropy computation, and deep features are gathered using CNN. Fourthly, both extracted wavelet entropy features and deep features have undergone an adaptive fusion process using an improved meta-heuristic algorithm, thus termed adaptive wavelet entropy deep feature fusion. Finally, the classification is performed through I-RNN to get the disease-related outcomes, where the weight of RNN is optimized using a new MVS-AVOA. Through the evaluation, the performance analysis of the proposed MVS-AVOA-RNN has 41.5% better than Naive Bayes, 26.8% better than SRU, 18.3% superior to LSTM, and 5.4% enriched than RNN.

Air traffic control is one of the most sensitive and important jobs in the field of flight safety. Working in such a context requires the use of high levels of cognitive functions, which can be impaired or reduced in speed and accuracy under pressure and stress. Another issue is that cognitive functions interact with non-cognitive factors, one of which is personality traits. Through using a causal-comparative method, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive functions like situational awareness, short-term memory, sustained attention and planning ability, and personality traits such as extraversion, emotionality, and adventurousness, on air traffic controllers' human error by controlling the effect of age. For this purpose, five tests were selected from the Vienna Test System, namely MR, CORSI, DAUF, TOL-F, and EPP6, to measure controllers' cognitive functions and personality traits. By convenience sampling, 37 controllers from the air control center participated in the tests. Excluding outliers, the groups were as follows: 16 controllers with error history and 15 controllers without error history. To control the effect of age on cognitive functions and personality traits, the groups' data were compared using the covariance analysis. According to the results, there is a difference between groups in situational awareness (sig = 0.008, P <= 0.05) and sustained attention (sig = 0.01, P <= 0.05), with error-free controllers showing higher scores in these functions. However, in other cognitive functions that were studied, namely shortterm memory (sig = 0.8, P <= 0.05) and planning ability (sig = 0.8, P <= 0.05), no difference was shown between the two groups. Moreover, the study of personality traits showed that controllers with errors differ from controllers without errors (sig = 0.02, P <= 0.05), but in emotionality (sig = 0.7, P <= 0.05) and adventurousness (sig = 0.6, P <= 0.05) there are no differences between the two groups. With these results in mind, efforts can be made to minimize potential errors in sensitive occupations such as air traffic control by using cognitive and personality screening tools.","[Hedayati, Sepideh; Sadeghi-Firoozabadi, Vahid; Heidari, Mahmoud] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Educ & Psychol, Tehran, Iran; [Bagheri, Morteza] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Railway Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Sze, N.

Future wireless society needs trustworthiness of the wireless positioning device and eco-friendliness of the transmission-reception process. These are triggered by the user requirements, preferences and targeted applications, and by the type of the environment where navigation takes place. A link has been missing between these user needs/environment awareness (or application layer) and the physical layer where the wireless device is actually designed. The missing link can be created by cognitive approaches, borrowed on one hand from cognitive human behavior, and on the other hand from cognitive computing. Building a cognition stage between the application and physical layers creates a myriad of new possibilities for flexible location-based services and positioning-based applications. MULTI-POS training network is bridging the gap between the lower technology layer and upper application layer involved in wireless mobile location. In addition, MULTI-POS offers comprehensive training to young fellows in the broad field of wireless location, creates novel technologies and business models for the future location-enabled wireless devices, promotes the exchange of fellows in mixed academic-industrial R&D trajectories and in multiple European cultures, and will initiate an educational and research framework that unifies the currently fragmented research activities on technological and applications aspects of wireless navigation. There is strong involvement of industrial partners in the network to accomplish all this.","[Nurmi, Jari; Lohan, Elena-Simona] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Nurmi, J (corresponding author), Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Tampere, Finland.",jari.nurmi@tut.fi; elena-simona.lohan@tut.fi,"Nurmi, Jari/A-1839-2008; Lohan, Elena Simona/L-5449-2013","Nurmi, Jari/0000-0003-2169-4606; Lohan, Elena Simona/0000-0003-1718-6924",,,,,7,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1530-1591,,978-3-9815-3707-9,DES AUT TEST EUROPE,,,2016,,,,,,,876,881,,,,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering,BF5WE,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000382679200162,View Full Record in Web of Science

As the primary cause of software defects, human error can be the key to understanding and preventing software defects. This paper proposes a defect prevention approach based on human error mechanisms: DPeHE. The approach includes both knowledge and regulation training in human error prevention. Knowledge training provides programmers with explicit knowledge on why programmers commit errors, what kinds of errors tend to be committed under different circumstances, and how these errors can be prevented. Regulation training further helps programmers to promote the awareness and ability to prevent human errors through practice. The practice is facilitated by a problem solving checklist and a root cause identification checklist. This paper provides a systematic framework that integrates knowledge across disciplines, e.g., cognitive science, software psychology and software engineering to defend against human errors in software development. Furthermore, we applied this approach in an international company at CMM Level 5 and a software development institution at CMM Level 1 in the Chinese Aviation Industry. The application cases show that the approach is feasible and effective in promoting developers' ability to prevent software defects, independent of process maturity levels.

Moreover, people cannot even decide when, how, and by whom the contents and information they are producing are used. In this work, we present the Digital Avatars framework for mobile-based collaborative social computing applications as a realization of People as a Service, a mobile computing model that empowers smartphones with the capability of learning virtual profiles or digital avatars of their owners and sharing them as a service in a controlled and seamless way. Digital Avatars offers services for third party applications, including an inference engine and a module for run-time scripts execution for interacting with the digital avatar in the smartphone assuring the privacy and full control of the users over their data.

In order to address nanotechnology, Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) as a research discipline requires multiple methods in engaging this novel technology strategically. One mode of engagement is through nanomaterials. Nanomaterials can be addressed by HFE in four significant ways: health and safety; new products and embedding in existing technologies for improved qualities; industrial production; along with, through university laboratory research. The aim of this article is to present one manner of engaging nanomaterials and HFE through addressing nanomaterials as embedded in existing technologies and their involvement in university research laboratories. This aspect of engagement is depicted by addressing the use of nanomaterials in an existing well-entrenched technology of concrete to produce an enhanced product-nanoconcrete. Using the framework of Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), this article addresses the work domain of nanoconcrete in terms of work practices in university laboratory settings. The models derived from CWA are used to identify the various constraints ranging from the environment to the people involved in the concrete domain. The results emphasize that to address nanomaterials (in this case, nanosilica), one has to comprehend its overarching matrix of the material (concrete) in which it is embedded. While the current article presents just one facet studying the intersection between nanomaterials and HFE, further research can identify new ways in which nanotechnology could be integrated robustly in the disciplinary viewpoint of HFE.","[Kant, Vivek] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Sociol, Singapore, Singapore; [Kant, Vivek] Nanyang Technol Univ, Inst Catastrophe Res Management, Singapore, Singapore; [Kant, Vivek] Singapore ETH Ctr, Future Resilient Syst, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University,"Kant, V (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Sociol, Singapore, Singapore.;Kant, V (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Inst Catastrophe Res Management, Singapore, Singapore.;Kant, V (corresponding author), Singapore ETH Ctr, Future Resilient Syst, Singapore, Singapore.",vkant@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,82,3,4,2,18,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1435-5558,1435-5566,,COGN TECHNOL WORK,Cogn.

Nonetheless, there exists no unanimous consensus among researchers regarding whether organizational AI adoption has a favorable or unfavorable impact on employees' career development. Building upon social cognitive theory, we explores the underlying mechanism through which organizational AI adoption in-fluences employees' proactive career behavior. A three-wave time-lagged survey involving 348 employees from three hotels and five advanced manufacturing enterprises in Chengdu, China, was conducted. The findings revealed that organizational AI adoption led to a reduction in employees' self-perceived employability. The prominence of an employee's future work self-salience was found to be a determining factor in how their self-perceived employability influenced proactive career behaviors. Specifically, this impact manifested negative for employees exhibiting high levels of future work self-salience, while it appears positive for those with low levels. Finally, this study confirmed the moderating role of future work self-salience in the indirect impact of organizational AI adoption on proactive career behavior through self-perceived employability. Our study underscores the significance of considering individual characteristics, such as future work self-salience, in analyzing how organizational AI adoption affects employees' career-related behaviors.","[Lin, Hongxia; Tian, Jian; Cheng, Bao] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Fac Business Adm, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Cheng, B (corresponding author), Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Fac Business Adm, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",chengbao@swufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72102189, 72202182]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences, China [21YJC630015]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JBK2307009]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","Funding This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 72102189; 72202182] ; the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences, China [grant number 21YJC630015] ; and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number JBK2307009] .",,93,6,6,153,252,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0747-5632,1873-7692,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

For these smart robots to make their own decisions about where to go and what to do, they need to be limited by several algorithms that run continuously and at the same time. Autonomy is the range of automated systems that can be adapted to a specific mission, residual risk, and level of team cohesion between humans and robots. Self-driving robotic systems should be collaborative, which means they should be able to interact actively with humans in a shared space or in proximity to humans and robots. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) works better when these COBOTs are aware of their surroundings. Mobile Robot (MR) teams whose perceptual and cognitive abilities are very well developed can help a lot with context awareness. To work well with humans, these robots should know what is going on with their human and other robot teammates so they can make decisions on their own. Also, robots should be able to share information about their surroundings so that humans can benefit from a better understanding of the situation. At the same time, humans should be able to see what the robots are doing. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based framework for humans and robots to work together to understand the context of Defense missions. An ontological model of contexts for missions, agents, and situations; a knowledge base comprising all the tools necessary for a sort of situation; and an efficient and reliable method of collaborative learning are some of its main contributions. The framework works well in terms of how long it takes for people to talk to each other. As the team continues to expand, it can also easily manage communication challenges and a widely differing event frequency range. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we adopted the theory of planned behavior and the effort-reward imbalance model to understand how behavioral intention relates to actual CWB, how such a relationship arises from personal beliefs and social norms, and whether perceptions of imbalance between efforts and rewards contribute to explain CWB. Two-wave data with a time lag of 12 weeks were collected among 80 Italian employees working in a large production plant of a private company operating in the manufacturing sector in Italy. Self-reported measures of attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions and CWB, perceived efforts and rewards, as well as control variables were collected. Attitudes and perceived behavioral control were indirectly related to CWB via behavioral intention. Effort-reward imbalance was not related to CWB. Our findings suggest that attitudinally controlled intentions, which have an internal locus of causality, are associated with greater likelihood of CWB performance, and that individual perceptions of control over CWB are key predictors of such a negative, volitional organizational behavior.","[Costantini, Arianna; Ceschi, Andrea; Sartori, Riccardo] Verona Univ, Dept Human Sci, Lungadige Porta Vittoria 17, I-37129 Verona, Italy",,"Costantini, A (corresponding author), Verona Univ, Dept Human Sci, Lungadige Porta Vittoria 17, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",arianna.costantini@univr.it,"Costantini, Arianna/G-4605-2016; Sartori, Riccardo/AAT-1585-2020; Ceschi, Andrea/U-7085-2017","Costantini, Arianna/0000-0002-9061-1547; Ceschi, Andrea/0000-0001-9059-9237",,,,,50,1,2,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1046-1310,1936-4733,,CURR PSYCHOL,Curr.

Ancient hunter-gatherers 200,000years ago, with bodies and brains like our own, in bands of a hundred well-known individuals or less, depended on spontaneous cooperative practice of knowledge and skills in a natural world. Before creating language, they appreciated beautiful objects and music. Anthropologists observe that similar living cultures accept that children learn in playful intent participation'. Large modern industrial states with millions of citizens competing in a global economy aim to instruct young people in scientific concepts and the rules of literacy and numeracy deemed important for employment with elaborate machines. Our psychobiological theories commonly assume that an infant starts with a body needing care and emotional regulation and a mind that assimilates concepts of objects by sensorimotor action and requires school instruction in rational principles after several years of cognitive development. Evidence from archeology and evolutionary anthropology indicates that Homo sapiens are born with an imaginative and convivial brain ready for the pleasure of shared invention and with a natural sense of beauty in handmade objects and music. In short, there are innate predispositions for culture for practicing meaningful habits and artful performances that are playfully inventive and seductive for companionship in traditions, and soon capable of grasping the clever purpose of shared tasks and tools. This knowledge of inventive human nature with esthetic and moral sensibilities has important implications for educational policy in our schools.

Although the general advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) architecture is widely discussed, limited details are available about the functionality of the modules and their interactions, backed up by scientific justification. This, in turn, limits the utilization of such architecture for pragmatic implementation. A cognitive ADAS architecture for level 4 autonomous-capable electrified vehicles (EVs) is proposed. Variations for levels 3 and 3.5, which are simply seen to be a combination of 3 and 4, with the primary fallback through a human driver and the secondary through an automated driving system, are also presented. A simulation framework is built for highway driving based on the proposed level 4 architecture for an enhanced Tesla Model S. It was concluded that the autonomous control provided a 23% energy economy increase, on average, compared to a human driver control. Through a detailed sensitivity analysis, the optimal mission/motion planning and energy management in addition to the positive impact on the EV battery, motor, and acceleration/deceleration profiles are considered to contribute to this significant increase in the energy economy of an autonomous-controlled EV.","[Divakarla, Kavya Prabha; Emadi, Ali] McMaster Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Razavi, Saiedeh] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University,"Divakarla, KP (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",divakakp@mcmaster.ca; emadi@mcmaster.ca; razavi@mcmaster.ca,,,Canada Excellence Research Chairs Program,Canada Excellence Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs),"This research was undertaken, in part, thanks to the funding from the Canada Excellence Research Chairs Program.

These defects, in turn, impact mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus and yield strength), thereby deteriorating the performance of a joint part. Machine learning methods such as feature-based support vector machines and end-to-end deep neural networks are recently coupled with in-situ sensing to link process parameters with the final properties, yet the low accuracy and precision, poor sample efficiency, and lack of interpretable learning limit their capabilities for reliable characterization. This research introduces hyperdimensional cognitive computing (HCC) that mimics human brain functionalities to fuse power, torque, and force data to provide robust, sample-efficient, and explainable learning for process-property characterization in FSW. Data augmentation is integrated with HCC to tackle the imbalanced data problem. The experimental results show that HCC seamlessly fuses in-situ data to predict the ultimate tensile strength with an F1-score of 0.899 +/- 0.048, which is 21.579%, 47.779%, 1.933%, and 68.139% better than support vector machine, logistic regression, Naive-Bayes and multilayer perceptron, respectively. Besides the superior prediction capability, HCC symbolic representation reveals that measured force is the critical factor in the characterization of ultimate tensile strength. The proposed HCC is shown to be effective for data fusion and single-pass learning and eliminates the necessity of costly and long retraining in various manufacturing processes such as 3D printing and bio-fabrication.","[Hoang, Danny; Chen, Ruimin; Imani, Farhad] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mech Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Mishra, Debasish] Univ Connecticut, UTC Inst Adv Syst Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Pal, Surjya K.] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Mech Engn, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Imani, F (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Mech Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",farhad.imani@uconn.edu,"Mishra, Debasish/AAZ-7435-2020",,,,,,29,0,0,1,1,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-8729-5,,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BW9TC,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:001221468500055,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the tools have focused on addressing technical aspects (e.g., checking the semantics of the language) rather than the usability. The literature shows that tools' usability is a major barrier to the adoption of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) in the industry. We hypothesize that the reason is a paucity of research on User Experience (UX) in the modelling community, and discuss that there are opportunities for further enhancements with respect to UX. We conducted a formative user study to observe, identify and understand the users' cognitive challenges when performing their tasks using modelling tools. The results of the study revealed that two of the most severe challenges of modellers when using modelling tools are: 1) Remembering the contextual information, and 2) Locating, understanding and fixing errors in the models. Our next steps are to propose solutions such as tooling features in order to alleviate the identified challenges and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions on users.","[Pourali, Parsa] Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Pourali, P (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",ppourali@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-5965-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,168,173,,10.1145/3270112.3275340,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3270112.3275340,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BR7KG,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000668151700030,View Full Record in Web of Science

The chatbot is an example of an artificial intelligence-based computer program that simulates human behavior by having a conversation and interacting with users using natural language. The implementation of chatbot technology in the educational context is still in its nascent stage, and further investigation into measuring its effectiveness in supporting learning and teaching processes is required, particularly in the context of higher education. Thus, this study presents the design and implementation of a task-oriented chatbot, that is embedded into the WhatsApp application, called Bashayer. It aims at supporting postgraduate students' motivation and learning strategies in Saudi Arabia. A quasi-experimental design with a single-subject experimental approach was adopted with a sample of 60 Saudi postgraduate students. The descriptive analysis of the collected data showed promising results of postgraduate students utilized the Bashayer chatbot system. Participants in the experimental group that used Bashayer were more motivated to learn than those in the control group. Participants also practiced more cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies while utilizing the chatbot compared to the control group. The results of this study are encouraging for the development of chatbot systems similar to Bashayer to support postgraduate students' successful learning. These results contribute to bridging the research gap and adding to the literature on chatbots use in postgraduate educational contexts.","[Al-Abdullatif, Ahlam Mohammed] King Faisal Univ, Coll Educ, Curriculum & Instruct Dept, Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Dokhny, Amany Ahmed] Ain Shams Univ, Coll Specif Educ, Educ Technol Dept, Cairo, Egypt; [Drwish, Amr Mohammed] Helwan Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Technol Dept, Cairo, Egypt",King Faisal University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Helwan University,"Al-Abdullatif, AM (corresponding author), King Faisal Univ, Coll Educ, Curriculum & Instruct Dept, Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia.",aalabdullateef@kfu.edu.sa,"Abdullatif, Ahlam/P-9441-2016","Drwish, prof Amr/0000-0002-3258-1327","Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [GRANT1706]","Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia","Funding This research was financially supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia (GRANT1706).",,78,11,11,42,137,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

After excluding the duplicate articles, 44 eligible articles from 2000 to 2021 were selected. The identified factors were categorized into three cognitive, physical, and psychological factors. In the next step, the opinions of 10 experts were used to prioritize the most relevant factors (criteria and sub-criteria) shaping the performance. Then, the criteria and sub-criteria were compared by DEMATEL technique to remove the factors of lower importance, and finally were weighted and prioritized by the ANP technique. Situation awareness, risk perception, and attention were identified as the most important cognitive factors. The most important physical shaping factors were fatigue/pain, chronic health disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders. Conscientiousness, job stress, and resilience were the most important psychological shaping factors. It is necessary to evaluate the firefighters' performance. Due to the influential role of situation awareness, fatigue/ pain, and conscientiousness on firefighters' performance, these critical factors should be reinforced to promote the firefighters' performance.","[Heydari, Payam] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Occupat Hlth & Safety Res Ctr, Dept Ergon, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Babamiri, Mohammad] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Ergon, Social Determinants Hlth Res Ctr, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Tapak, Leili] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Modeling Noncommunicable Dis Res Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Golmohammadi, Rostam] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Occupat Hyg, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Golmohammadi, Rostam] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Hlth Sci, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Kalatpour, Omid] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Occupat Hlth & Safety Res Ctr, Dept Occupat Hlth & Safety Engn, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran",Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences,"Kalatpour, O (corresponding author), Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Occupat Hlth & Safety Res Ctr, Dept Occupat Hlth & Safety Engn, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran.",Kalatpour@umsha.ac.ir,"kalatpour, Omid/U-8094-2017; babamiri, Mohammad/L-1302-2017; Heydari, Payam/AAD-3566-2022; Tapak, Leili/L-1280-2017","Tapak, Leili/0000-0002-4378-3143; Kalatpour, Omid/0000-0002-7220-9749",Hamadan University of Medical Sciences,Hamadan University of Medical Sciences(Hamadan University of Medical Sciences),This paper has been prepared from a Ph.D. thesis in ergonomics entitled Presenting a model to evaluate the performance of firefighters based on individual variables and was supported by the Vice president for Research at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.,,40,4,4,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0379-7112,1873-7226,,FIRE SAFETY J,Fire Saf.

Background: Adoption of information and communication technology in cyberphysical systems (CPSs) for critical infrastructures enables automated and distributed control but introduces cybersecurity risk. Many CPSs employ SCADA industrial control systems that have become the target of cyberattacks, which inflict physical damage without use of force. Given that absolute security is not feasible for complex systems, cyberintrusions that introduce unanticipated events will occur; a proper response will in turn require human adaptive ability. Therefore, analysis techniques that can support security assessment and human factors engineering are invaluable for defending CPSs. Method: We conducted work domain analysis using the abstraction hierarchy (AH) to model a generic SCADA implementation to identify the functional structures and means-ends relations. We then adopted a case study approach examining the Stuxnet cyberattack by developing and integrating AHs for the uranium enrichment process, SCADA implementation, and malware to investigate the interactions between the three aspects of cybersecurity in CPSs. Results: The AHs for modeling a generic SCADA implementation and studying the Stuxnet cyberattack are useful for mapping attack vectors, identifying deficiencies in security processes and features, and evaluating proposed security solutions with respect to system objectives. Conclusion: Work domain analysis is an effective analytical method for studying cybersecurity of CPSs for critical infrastructures in a psychologically relevant manner. Application: Work domain analysis should be applied to assess cybersecurity risk and inform engineering and user interface design.","[Wang, Hao; Lau, Nathan; Gerdes, Ryan M.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lau, N (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Tech, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 1145 Perry St,Durham Hall,RM 250, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",nathan.lau@vt.edu,"Lau, Nathan/T-1767-2019","Lau, Nathan/0000-0003-2235-9527",,,,,83,5,10,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

This paper introduces the concept of human factors (HF) climate for the first time and explores the theoretical relationships among potential dimensions. The HF climate can be defined as the holistic method for studying the perceived psychological, physiological, and emotional impacts of work on human resources. Literature has revealed that most studies examine individual human factors independently and only a few pairwise relationships have been explored. To date, there is no study to examine human factors as a system or climate, although most studies use perception-based surveys and acknowledge that different aspects of human factors do not act in isolation. The goal of the HF climate is to replace the study of one or two dimensions (e.g., safety) at a time and allow us to consider the interrelationships among multiple dimensions simultaneously.","[Welfare, Katie S.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hallowell, Matthew R.] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Construct Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Welfare, KS (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",dewlanek@colorado.edu; matthew.hallowell@colorado.edu,"Hallowell, Matthew/G-7918-2016",,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8287-2,,,,2020,,,,,,,289,298,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BR4QC,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000652188000032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Metaverse is a unique, continuous, and shared virtual world where humans embody a digital form within an online platform. Through a digital avatar, Metaverse users should have a perceptual presence within the environment and can interact and control the virtual world around them. Thus, a human-centric design is a crucial element of the Metaverse. The human users are not only the central entity but also the source of multi-sensory data that can be used to enrich the Metaverse ecosystem. In this survey, we study the potential applications of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technologies that can enhance the experience of Metaverse users. By directly communicating with the human brain, the most complex organ in the human body, BCI technologies hold the potential for the most intuitive human-machine system operating at the speed of thought. BCI technologies can enable various innovative applications for the Metaverse through this neural pathway, such as user cognitive state monitoring, digital avatar control, virtual interactions, and imagined speech communications. This survey first outlines the fundamental background of the Metaverse and BCI technologies. We then discuss the current challenges of the Metaverse that can potentially be addressed by BCI, such as motion sickness when users experience virtual environments or the negative emotional states of users in immersive virtual applications. After that, we propose and discuss a new research direction called Human Digital Twin, in which digital twins can create an intelligent and interactable avatar from the user's brain signals. We also present the challenges and potential solutions in synchronizing and communicating between virtual and physical entities in the Metaverse. Finally, we highlight the challenges, open issues, and future research directions for BCI-enabled Metaverse systems.","[Zhu, Howe Yuan] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Comp Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Hieu, Nguyen Quang; Hoang, Dinh Thai; Nguyen, Diep N.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Elect & Data Engn, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Lin, Chin-Teng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australian AI Inst, Fac Engn & IT, Human Centr AI Ctr,CIBCI Lab, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Zhu, HY (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Comp Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",howe.zhu@uts.edu.au; hieu.nguyen-1@student.uts.edu.au; hoang.dinh@uts.edu.au; diep.nguyen@uts.edu.au; chin-teng.lin@uts.edu.au,"Dinh, Hoang/K-5135-2012; Nguyen, Hieu/AAA-7363-2022; Zhu, Howe/KOD-3801-2024; Nguyen, Diep/AAQ-2491-2020; Lin, Chin-Teng (CT)/G-8129-2017","Zhu, Howe/0000-0003-0775-887X; Nguyen, Diep N./0000-0003-2659-8648; Nguyen, Hieu/0000-0003-1517-8285; Lin, Chin-Teng (CT)/0000-0001-8371-8197",Australian Research Council through the DECRA Project,Australian Research Council through the DECRA Project(Australian Research Council),This work was supported in part by the Australian ResearchCouncil through the DECRA Project under Grant DE210100651; in part by theAustralian Research Council (ARC) under Discovery Grant DP210101093 andGrant DP220100803; in part by the Australian National Health and MedicalResearch Council (NHMRC) Ideas Grant under Grant APP2021183; in partby the UTS Human-Centric AI Centre funding sponsored by GrapheneX(2023-2031); in part by the Australia Defence Innovation Hub under ContractP18-650825; in part by the Australian Cooperative Research Centres Projects(CRC-P) Round 11 under Grant CRCPXI000007; in part by the LockheedMartin Corporation under Cooperative Agreement 4038; in part by the U.S.Office of Naval Research Global under Cooperative Agreement ONRG -NICOP - N62909-19-1-2058; in part by the AFOSR - DST AustralianAutonomy Initiative Agreement under Grant ID10134; and in part by the NSWDefence Innovation Network and the NSW State Government of Australia forFinancial Support in part of this Research under Grant DINPP2019 S1-03/09and Grant PP21-22.03.02.,,219,2,2,13,13,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",,1553-877X,,IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT,IEEE Commun.

Despite being simple, this test is oftentimes skipped by the clinicians. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to investigate the potential of static and dynamic upper-body gestures based on the Praxis test and their potential in a medical framework to automatize the test procedures for computer-assisted cognitive assessment of older adults. In order to carry out gesture recognition as well as correctness assessment of the performances we have recollected a novel challenging RGB-D gesture video dataset recorded by Kinect v2, which contains 29 specific gestures suggested by clinicians and recorded from both experts and patients performing the gesture set. Moreover, we propose a framework to learn the dynamics of upper-body gestures, considering the videos as sequences of short-term clips of gestures. Our approach first uses body part detection to extract image patches surrounding the hands and then, by means of a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) model, it learns deep hand features which are then linked to a long short-term memory to capture the temporal dependencies between video frames. We report the results of four developed methods using different modalities. The experiments show effectiveness of our deep learning based approach in gesture recognition and performance assessment tasks. Satisfaction of clinicians from the assessment reports indicates the impact of framework corresponding to the diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the researchers or the organizations are able to collect large amount of information via the feedback of the crowd in a short time with a low cost. Despite the wide adoption of crowdsourcing, several of its fundamental problems remain unsolved especially at the information and cognitive levels with respect to incentive design, information aggregation, and heterogeneous learning. This tutorial aims to: (1) provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploring the power of crowdsourcing from the perspective of optimizing the wisdom of the crowd; and (2) identify the open challenges and provide insights to the future trends in the context of human-in-the-loop learning.

The technology has great potential in several applied areas, ranging from medical applications to entertainment industry, and creates new conditions for basic research in cognitive neuroscience. The BCIs of today, however, offer only crude online classification of the user's current state of mind, and more sophisticated decoding of mental states depends on time-consuming offline data analysis. The present paper addresses this limitation directly by leveraging a set of improvements to the analytical pipeline to pave the way for the next generation of online BCIs. Specifically, we introduce an open-source research framework that features a modular and customizable hardware-independent design. This framework facilitates human-in-the-loop (HIL) model training and retraining, real-time stimulus control, and enables transfer learning and cloud computing for the online classification of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Stimuli for the subject and diagnostics for the researcher are shown on separate displays using web browser technologies. Messages are sent using the Lab Streaming Layer standard and websockets. Real-time signal processing and classification, as well as training of machine learning models, is facilitated by the open-source Python package Timeflux. The framework runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. While online analysis is the main target of the BCI-HIL framework, offline analysis of the EEG data can be performed with Python, MATLAB, and Julia through packages like MNE, EEGLAB, or FieldTrip. The paper describes and discusses desirable properties of a human-in-the-loop BCI research platform.

There is theoretically no limit to their applicative area and use cases and many of them are already explored such as medical, education, industry, entertainment, military... Some interactions to these eyewear devices are becoming a standard such as mid-air hand gestures and voice command Paradoxically, nowadays, in many use cases where these kinds of eyewear devices are currently implemented, the users cannot perform these available interactions without constraints: e.g. when the users are already using their hands, when they are in a noisy environment or the opposite where silence is required and the vocal command could not be used properly, or even in a social context where both mid-air hand gestures and vocal command could be seen as weird or undesired for the users. Thus, this thesis project aims to extend interactivity of augmented reality eyewear devices: 1) by providing more discrete interaction such as head gesture based on cognitive image schemas theory, metaphorical extension and natural user interfaces based on the smart watch fmger touch gesture, 2) by using the context of the user to provide the more convenient interface and feedback in the right space and time.

With the rapid pace of digitalization in technological systems, there is a need for a design process that can handle the systemic design goals and the experiential basis of interaction. Currently, the traditional EID is well-positioned to address these challenges. However, methodologically, it needs to be substantiated to make it accessible for designers, designing for novel arenas, such as Industry 4.0. Further, substantiating the design process will help designers, engineers, and human factors researchers with an accessible pathway that links the design brief to the final interface form. Therefore, this article delves into the design basis in the work of the Riso group and other prominent EID researchers and practitioners. In addition, it draws from a variety of themes in the discipline of design that addresses methodology. In particular, key insights are drawn from the design methods movement (1960s-); design, communication, and complexity from the Ulm school of design, 1953-1968; cognitive research conducted on designers and design activities; and finally, interaction design and communication design processes and models. All of these insights have been used syncretically to create the new integrated EID (iEID) process. This new design process consists of nine stages divided into three phases of divergence, transformation, and convergence, converting the initial design brief to the final interface. The steps of iEID are demonstrated using the example of interface design for a digital twin in the manufacturing sector.","[Kant, Vivek; Sudakaran, Jayasurya Salem] Indian Inst Technol, IDC Sch Design, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Kant, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, IDC Sch Design, Human Factors & Sociotech Syst Studios, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",vivek.kant@iitb.ac.in,,"Salem Sudakaran, Jayasurya/0009-0007-0256-8299",Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [Spons/ID/100017422/2018],Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Grant/Award Number: Spons/ID/100017422/2018",,134,4,4,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-8471,1520-6564,,HUM FACTOR ERGON MAN,Hum.

This transformation involves technological, organisational and personnel sides that are closely interrelated with each other: change in technology use will require new job positions and, hence, new roles in the organisational structure, e.g. in projects. Those new roles can he fulfilled by hiring new employees or training existing employees, nevertheless, competences will play the main role in that process. Competence is a quite complex phenomenon that is intensively researched by the scientific community in project management. Further on, competence assessment is derived from various aspects of skills, knowledge, and attitude or performance measurement, which covers different cognitive and behavioural sides of a human being. However, there are a variety of methods to measure competences. In this paper, normative (self-evaluation) and formative (external evaluation) methods will be compared and two questions are supposed to be answered: whether there is a correlation between these two modes of assessment, and whether these new tests are consistent. To answer this, the case study of an existing assessment tool will be analysed and new measures will be developed specifically for a case of international industrial small and mediumsized enterprises (SME's) based in the North-Rhine Westphalia region of Germany. These measures will be evaluated and tested by the employees and validated through series of semi-structured interviews.","[Mikhridinova, Nargiza; Wolff, Carsten] Dortmund Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Dortmund, Germany; [Hussein, Bassam] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Mikhridinova, N (corresponding author), Dortmund Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Dortmund, Germany.",nargiza.mikhridinova@fh-dortmund.de; carsten.wolff@fh-dortmund.de; bassam.hussein@ntnu.no,"HUSSEIN, BASSAM/AAA-6437-2019; Mikhridinova, Nargiza/HKE-8942-2023","Mikhridinova, Nargiza/0000-0003-1341-6788; Hussein, Bassam/0000-0003-0743-1316",,,,,17,0,0,2,13,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-2605-3,INT WORKSH INT DATA,,,2021,,,,,,,1190,1194,,10.1109/IDAACS53288.2021.9660974,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS53288.2021.9660974,,,5,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BT7GR,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000848390800106,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since the Renaissance, the eye has been used in art as a symbol of the viewer's imaginativelife. It has also played an important role as a material for understanding the human mind. Research on theanatomy and movements of the eye has a long history, spanning a wide geographical range from ancientGreece to the civilisations of Babylon, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. Eye movement is a behaviour shared by allanimal species with basic visual structures. The fundamental function of this behaviour is to create a stablerepresentation of the visual world on the retina at any given time and to facilitate exploration of the environment.The study of eye movements provides important insights into how organisms perceive the world by revealinghow they look at it. Within the repertoire of human eye movements, saccadic and fixational movements arethe most frequently measured and studied in attention literature. The eye-tracking method offers an objectivemeasurement approach for testing previously proposed attention hypotheses and allows the investigation of parameters such as where a person looks at any given moment and for how long. These parameters areparticularly important for visual attention studies. Through the window opened by the eyes, cognitive psychologyand its different disciplines can explore numerous topics related to human visual attention and, consequently,the mind. In addition to its role in psychology, eye tracking remains an important methodological tool in manyfields related to human attention and perception mechanisms, such as art, advertising, and industry. This reviewbriefly covers the origins of the eye-tracking technique, followed by the basic mechanics of eye movements.Finally, the study discusses the relationship between eye movements and attentional processes, which areessential for various mental tasks.","[Tuerkan, Belguezar Nilay] Trier Univ, Bilissel Psikol Bolumu, Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier,"Türkan, BN (corresponding author), Trier Univ, Bilissel Psikol Bolumu, Trier, Germany.",turkan.nilay@gmail.com,,,,,,,164,0,0,7,7,"ISTANBUL UNIV, FAC LETTERS, DEPT PSYCHOLOGY",ISTANBUL,"ISTANBUL UNIV, FAC LETTERS, DEPT PSYCHOLOGY, ISTANBUL, 34459, Turkiye",1304-4680,2602-2982,,STUD PSYCHOL-TURKEY,Stud.

Security risk management can also be applied very early in the system's development life-cycle, when its architecture is still poorly defined; in this case, the objective is to positively influence the design work so as to produce a secure architecture from the start. The latter work is made difficult by the uncertainties on the architecture and the multiple round-trips required to keep the risk assessment study and the system architecture aligned. This is particularly true for very large projects running over many years. This paper addresses the issues raised by those risk assessment studies performed early in the system's development life-cycle. Based on industrial experience, it asserts that attack trees can help solve the human cognitive scalability issue related to securing those large, continuously-changing system-designs. However, big attack trees are difficult to build, and even more difficult to maintain. This paper therefore proposes a systematic approach to automate the construction and maintenance of such big attack trees, based on the system's operational and logical architectures, the system's traditional risk assessment study and a security knowledge database.","[Paul, Stephane] Thales Res & Technol, Palaiseau, France",Thales Group,"Paul, S (corresponding author), Thales Res & Technol, Palaiseau, France.",stephane.paul@thalesgroup.com,,,ITEA2 MERgE project,ITEA2 MERgE project,The research leading to these results has received funding from the ITEA2 MERgE project.

Automating the credit risk analysis process using Large Language Models can bring transformative changes to the finance industry, but not without appropriate measures to ensure trustworthy responses. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-engineering method that enhances the ability of Large Language Models to generate reliable credit risk reports - Labeled Guide Prompting (LGP). LGP consists of: (1) providing annotated few-shot examples to the LLM that denote sets of tokens in an exemplary prompt that are of greater importance when generating sets of tokens in the exemplary response and (2) providing text in the prompt that describes the direction, pathways and interactions between variables from a Bayesian network used for credit risk assessment, thus promoting abductive reasoning. Using data from 100 credit applications, we demonstrate that LGP enables LLMs to generate credit risk reports that are preferred by human credit analysts (in 60-90% of cases) over alternative credit risk reports created by their peers in a blind review. Additionally, we found a statistically significant improvement (p-value < 10(-10)) in the insightfulness of the responses generated using LGP when compared to identical prompts without LGP components. We conclude that Labeled Guide Prompting can enhance LLM performance in complex problem-solving tasks, achieving a level of competency comparable to or exceeding human experts.","[Teixeira, Ana Clara; Marar, Vaishali; Yazdanpanah, Hamed; Oliveira, Aline; Ghassemi, Mohammad] Traive Inc, Brookline, MA 02446 USA",,"Teixeira, AC (corresponding author), Traive Inc, Brookline, MA 02446 USA.",ana.teixeira@traivefinance.com; vaishali.marar@traivefinance.com; hamed.yazdanpanah@traivefinance.com; aline.oliveira@traivefinance.com; mohammad.ghassemi@traivefinance.com,,"Marar, Vaishali/0009-0008-9389-140X; Teixeira Noronha, Ana Clara/0009-0009-2930-6955; /0000-0001-5135-8588",Traive Inc.,Traive Inc.,"This research was supported by Traive Inc.

The new generations, however, seem to be much more eager to engage with them. Present paper intends to analyse international literature about young generations' attitudes towards AI and robots and presents a primary research about Hungarian young people's attitude towards robots. The aim of the paper is to test the statements of international literature against a suitable sample of Y and Z generation people, to figure out, whether there are real significant differences between the two generations, when it comes to robots and trust in them. On the basis of the data presented in the paper generation Z is much more willing to engage with robots, than generation Y. However, this attitude is not generated by their loneliness, but originates from their need for personal contact. Hence, the research did not only succeed in identifying differences between the two generations under scrutiny, but pinpointed a difference that is rather neglected, or misinterpreted in international literature.","[Lazanyi, Kornelia] Obuda Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Obuda University,"Lazányi, K (corresponding author), Obuda Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",lazanyi.kornelia@kgk.uni-obuda.hu,"Lazányi, Kornélia/HGB-3450-2022",,,,,,29,8,9,4,13,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1562-5850,,978-1-7281-1213-8,IEEE INT CONF INTELL,,,2019,,,,,,,191,194,,,,,,4,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BQ4GS,,,,,2024-11-15,WOS:000589668400032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Machine learning (ML) tools can be effectively utilized for improving inspection accuracy and diminishing human interventions. There are reports on defect classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and EC sensor signal, utilization of kernel-based Principle Component Analysis (PCA) schemes for automatic detection and classification of surface and sub-surface defects. However, the reported works dealt with artificially grown synthetic defects/flaws only. The utility of these scheme on naturally grown in-process defects/flaws in industrial components need further attention. In this communication, we studied and implemented an adaptive sampling protocol based on in-process defect assessment using an EC sensor to optimise the prediction accuracy of the ML algorithms. An encircling coil EC sensor was developed in-house and implemented for extracting the EC signal patterns of various naturally grown in-process defects/flaws. The extracted signals were then marshalled using a suitable in-cognitive clustering technique. A set of algorithms based on cognitive SVMs were trained and subsequently, were tested on EC testing data. We found fine Gaussian kernel functions as the most robust kernel function in terms of prediction accuracy (similar to 99%) and speed (similar to 4500 observations per second). Moreover, the proposed SVM model is immune to noisy signals with SNR above 30 dB. From the application's perspective, these findings indicate the importance on achieving higher efficiency combined with reliable quality control of the final products culminating in further energy conservation.","[Dutta, Chandan; Sagar, Sarmishtha Palit; Bhushan, Ravi; Das, Tarun Kumar] Adv Mat & Proc AMP Div, CSIR NML, Jamshedpur 831009, Bihar, India; [Kumar, Alok] Tata Steel Ltd, NDT & S Grp, Jamshedpur 831001, Bihar, India; [Kadu, Satish] Tata Steel Ltd, Technol Grp, Jamshedpur 831001, Bihar, India",Tata Sons; Tata Steel Limited; Tata Sons; Tata Steel Limited,"Das, TK (corresponding author), Adv Mat & Proc AMP Div, CSIR NML, Jamshedpur 831009, Bihar, India.",dutta.chandan93@gmail.com; sarmi@nmlindia.org; alokkumar17294@gmail.com; rvibhushan@gmail.com; satish.kadu@tatasteel.com; tkdas@nmlindia.org,"Dutta, Chandan/ABE-1368-2020; BHUSHAN, RAVI/AAS-8866-2020","Dutta, Chandan/0000-0002-1575-8530",,,,,31,0,0,0,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0093-9994,1939-9367,,IEEE T IND APPL,IEEE Trans.

The construction industry has traditionally been a laggard industry in terms of digital-technology adoption. When leading firms in this industry have experimented with these technologies, many of these experiments have met resistance. In this paper we take an institutional lens to study why and particular social structures appears to have contributed to the resistance and paucity of success stories. Within institutional research, we focus on research with traces to cognitive science and psychology. We have carried out a qualitative embedded multiple-case study on resistance to new technologies and how to overcome such resistance. The study involves four use cases in the Finnish construction industry: (1) automation of a material-product subcontractor's production planning; (2) business-model innovation by contractor on how to best work across multiple construction sites at once; (3) machine learning and automation of documentation by a software firm; and (4) promotion of a vision of information sharing across organizations by the above software firm. Based on within and cross-case analyses, preliminary empirical findings are that AI, ML and DL have in the Finnish construction industry challenged institutionalized forms of organizing and workflow established long since in the industry and, until about the time of this piece of research, taken for granted. Resistance was nonetheless beginning to be overcome at the time of writing this piece of research with small-group interaction across firms- such as those in this study- in the industry ecosystem. Human-human mediation and face-to-face encounters were building trust in and across the organizations. The implication for practice and policy is that business transformation will not quickly and autonomously transform into impersonal or machine-machine exchange but, before that, requires human-human mediation. In the long-term, Al and analytics have boundless potential use cases in E&C [i.e. engineering and construction]. Machine learning is gaining some momentum as an overarching use case (that is, one applicable to the entire construction life cycle, from preconstruction through O&M 8i.e. operations and management), particularly in reality capture (for example, in conjunction with computer vision) as well as for comparison of in situ field conditions with plans (for example, supporting twin models). Indeed, by applying machine learning to an ongoing project, schedules could be optimized to sequence tasks and hit target deadlines, and divergences from blueprints could be caught closer to real time and corrected using a variety of predetermined potential scenarios.

Upon inhalation, BTEX compounds are swiftly absorbed, impacting various physiological systems adversely. Understanding the diverse impacts of BTEX exposure is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies and safeguarding public health. This paper elucidates the mechanisms underlying BTEX impacts on the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, urinary, hematologic, hematopoietic, immune, reproductive, and nervous systems. Inhalation primarily affects the respiratory system, leading to lung tissue damage, decreased lung function, inflammation, and asthma. Cardiovascular impacts include arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. BTEX exposure induces hepatic and genetic toxicity, hematologic disorders, immune dysfunction, and reproductive effects.

In the research, we aim to develop a training program which helps designers to enhance the mechanism of imagination during industrial designing. First, imagination and creativity theories, design cognition and thinking, design methods and techniques are being explored by way of a literature survey in order to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and mechanism of human imagination. Research methods for design thinking, the pattern of imagination, the factors that affect the imagination, and developing techniques and teaching methods for imagination, have then been inducted for further studies. We then explored the forty international professional designers using secondary interview data. The data was analyzed based on the abstract and concrete, the activities, location, etc., the source of imaginative inspiration for the designers were categorized. The results showed that two designers using an abstract way of generating an imagination and inspiration mode accounted for 58%, using concrete objects to achieve the source of inspiration accounts for 42%. Indoor activities accounted for 64% inspiration of the factors of environmental stimulation, 36% were outdoor activities. Therefore, for the learning strategy, we conclude that enhancing the cognitive and experience-driven skills to gain insights from a variety of life experiences, expands the implicit design knowledge for the cognitive activities to trigger the imagination in the design thinking of designing.","[Hsu, Min-Wei] Tatung Univ, Dept Visual Commun Design, New Taipei City 23154, Taiwan; Tatung Univ, Jin Wen Univ, Dept Ind Design, New Taipei City 23154, Taiwan",,"Hsu, MW (corresponding author), Tatung Univ, Dept Visual Commun Design, 99 Anzhong Rd, New Taipei City 23154, Taiwan.",wei777@just.edu.tw,"Yang, wenhao/GXG-5965-2022; LIANG, KUEI-CHIA/KXR-7687-2024",,,,,,25,1,1,0,15,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

This study proposes a methodology to analyse and address multiple deficiencies observed during SIRE 2.0 inspections. The methodology is structured based on Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to identify and analyse the causes of deficiencies derived from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) classification scheme, including the factors under key dimensions, such as diminished human performance, marine environment, safety administration, and management. An illustrative case study on a set of deficiencies has been conducted to ascertain the utility of the methodology. The results specifically reveal that inadequate situational communication and awareness, inadequate knowledge of ship procedures, regulations, and standards, inadequate supervision, being unaware of role or task responsibility, poor maintenance, etc. are the potential causes that might lead to the occurrence of deficiency items. Considering the dimension-based distributions of causes, the study highlights integrated preventive action recommendations specific to the analysed deficiency cases. Consequently, the study might help tanker shipping companies manage key challenges with SIRE 2.0 implementations.","[Orhan, Muhittin; Celik, Metin] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Basic Sci, TR-34940 Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkiye",Istanbul Technical University,"Orhan, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Basic Sci, TR-34940 Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkiye.",muhittinorhan@yahoo.com,"Celik, Metin/D-8717-2014","Celik, Metin/0000-0003-0107-1380; Orhan, Muhittin/0000-0001-5384-8003",,,,,43,0,0,0,0,FAC MARITIME STUDIES,SPLIT,"RUDERA BOSKOVICA 37, SPLIT, 21000, CROATIA",1848-3305,1848-3313,,TRANS MARIT SCI-TOMS,Trans.

One potential deterrent to adoption of such collaborative work methods often cited by industry stakeholders is resistance by workers stemming from their fear of losing their jobs or having to learn new approaches and methods of performing construction work. Although significant prior studies have used path analyses to statistically evaluate hypotheses about technology adoption models by estimating the relationships in the models, no research has specifically investigated the intention to work in HRC through such an approach. This study addresses this knowledge gap and empirically investigates the factors affecting construction personnel's behavioral intention to accept HRC. HRC in this study is envisioned as robotic assistants performing the physically demanding repetitive work while construction personnel focus on cognitive tasks necessary to plan and supervise the work. An HRC adoption model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT) is presented. This study expands a TAM-IDT model with new constructs such as job satisfaction and openness to training to explore an improved model that increases the understanding of construction personnel's intention to adopt HRC. Data collected from 156 construction personnel were analyzed to identify the key components based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The proposed model, consisting of eight external and four internal variables, was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results indicated that variables such as perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) had a positive and significant impact on behavioral intention (BI) to work in the described HRC system. Both theoretical and management implications emerging from the study are offered as insights to assist the construction industry in managing the introduction and adoption of HRC for on-site construction.","[Park, Somin; Yu, Hongrui; Menassa, Carol C.; Kamat, Vineet R.] Univ of Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Menassa, CC (corresponding author), Univ of Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",somin@umich.edu; yhongrui@umich.edu; menassa@umich.edu; vkamat@umich.edu,,"Menassa, Carol/0000-0002-2453-0386; Kamat, Vineet/0000-0003-0788-5588","United States National Science Foundation (NSF) [2025805, 2128623]; NSF; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [2128623] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate for STEM Education; Division Of Undergraduate Education [2025805] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","United States National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Directorate for STEM Education; Division Of Undergraduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))","AcknowledgmentsThe work presented in this paper was supported financially by two United States National Science Foundation (NSF) Awards 2025805 and 2128623.

Objective This paper describes a functional reference architecture for autonomous driving, along with various considerations that influence such an architecture. The functionality is described at the logical level, without dependence on specific implementation technologies. Method Engineering design has been used as the research method, which focuses on creating solutions intended for practical application. The architecture has been refined and applied over a 5 year period to the construction of prototype autonomous vehicles in three different categories, with both academic and industrial stakeholders. Results The architectural components are divided into categories pertaining to (i) perception, (ii) decision and control, and (iii) vehicle platform manipulation. The architecture itself is divided into two layers comprising the vehicle platform and a cognitive driving intelligence. The distribution of components among the architectural layers considers two extremes: one where the vehicle platform is as dumb as possible, and the other, where the vehicle platform can be treated as an autonomous system with limited intelligence. We recommend a clean split between the driving intelligence and the vehicle platform. The architecture description includes identification of stakeholder concerns, which are grouped under the business and engineering categories. A comparison with similar architectures is also made, wherein we claim that the presence of explicit components for world modeling, semantic understanding, and vehicle platform abstraction seem unique to our architecture. Conclusion The concluding discussion examines the influences of implementation technologies on functional architectures and how an architecture is affected when a human driver is replaced by a computer. The discussion also proposes that reduction and acceleration of testing, verification, and validation processes is the key to incorporating continuous deployment processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) is applied to calculate seafarer's reliability on operational safety. As different from original nine common performance conditions (CPCs), eight simplified CPCs are proposed, as a way of capturing the essential aspects of the situation and the conditions for on-board work. The weights of CPCs are calculated by fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), which allows for more reliable results. Human error probability is obtained, which can be used to evaluate human reliability in tanker shipping. The proposed method is able to produce reliable results of human performance failure.

Previous studies on the factors affecting human error are rather vague from the perspective of complex and changeable working environments. The purpose of this paper is to develop a dynamic causal model of human errors to improve safety management in the construction industry. A theoretical model is developed and tested through a case study. Design/methodology/approach First, the authors defined the causal relationship between construction and human errors based on the cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM). A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) was then developed by connecting time-variant causal relationships of human errors. Next, prediction, sensitivity analysis and diagnostic analysis of DBN were applied to demonstrate the function of this model. Finally, a case study of elevator installation was presented to verify the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach in a construction work environment. Findings The results of the proposed model were closer to those of practice than previous static models, and the features of the systematization and dynamics are more efficient in adapting toward increasingly complex and changeable environments. Originality/value This research integrated CREAM as the theoretical foundation for a novel time-variant causal model of human errors in construction. Practically, this model highlights the hazards that potentially trigger human error occurrences, facilitating the implementation of proactive safety strategy and safety measures in advance.","[Ma, Zhangming] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chong, Heap-Yih] Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Liao, Pin-Chao] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Curtin University; Tsinghua University,"Liao, PC (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pinchao@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Liao, Pin-Chao/Z-3750-2019; Chong, Heap-Yih/M-8354-2017","Chong, Heap-Yih/0000-0002-6080-7530","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51878382, 51578317]; United Technologies Corporation [20153000259]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); United Technologies Corporation,The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 51878382 and 51578317) and the United Technologies Corporation (No. 20153000259) for their support.

Among the motivations for the use of MASS is the potential increase in safety when compared to traditional manned ships - particularly regarding human error. However, in spite of having less human intervention, MASS will rely on humans working on an onshore control center for their operation. There have been great advances in investigating the technical aspects of MASS operation, such as collision avoidance algorithms and detection sensors; nevertheless, possible human tasks and their deriving failures have rarely been addressed. This paper thus explores how humans can be a key factor for successful collision avoidance in future MASS operations. It presents a task analysis for collision avoidance through Hierarchical Task Analysis and making use of a cognitive model for categorizing the tasks. The failures in accomplishing these tasks are further analyzed, and human failure events are identified. The results provide valuable information for the design stage of the system; which must acknowledge the operators' tasks to ensure a safe voyage. The conclusions of this paper are also a starting point for the implementation of a Human Reliability Analysis for this operation.","[Ramos, Manilla Abilio; Utne, Ingrid Bouwer; Mosleh, Ali] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Marine Technol Dept, Otto Nielsens Veg 10, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Mosleh, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, B John Garrick Inst Risk Sci, 404 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Ramos, MA (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Marine Technol Dept, Otto Nielsens Veg 10, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",marilia.a.ramos@ntnu.no; ingrid.b.utne@ntnu.no; mosleh@ucla.edu,"Utne, Ingrid/B-7405-2011","Utne, Ingrid Bouwer/0000-0002-0952-3970; Ramos, Marilia/0000-0002-5039-5747",,,,,54,126,133,7,111,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

J,"Hasanzadeh, S; Esmaeili, B; Dodd, MD",,,,"Hasanzadeh, Sogand; Esmaeili, Behzad; Dodd, Michael D.",,,Impact of Construction Workers' Hazard Identification Skills on Their Visual Attention,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Construction safety; Hazard identification skill; Eye-tracking technology; Human error; Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA); Labor and personnel issues,HUMAN ERROR-PROBABILITY; EYE TRACKING; PERCEPTION; DRIVERS; SAFETY; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; AWARENESS; YOUNGER,"Eye-movement metrics have been shown to correlate with attention and, therefore, represent a means of identifying and analyzing an individual's cognitive processes. Human errors-such as failure to identify a hazard-are often attributed to a worker's lack of attention. Piecemeal attempts have been made to investigate the potential of harnessing eye movements as predictors of human error (e. g., failure to identify a hazard) in the construction industry, although more attempts have investigated human error via subjective measurements. To address this knowledge gap, the present study harnessed eye-tracking technology to evaluate the impacts of workers' hazard-identification skills on their attentional distributions and visual search strategies. To achieve this objective, an experiment was designed in which the eye movements of 31 construction workers were tracked while they searched for hazards in 35 randomly ordered construction scenario images. Workers were then divided into three groups on the basis of their hazard identification performance. Three fixation-related metrics-fixation count, dwell-time percentage, and run count-were analyzed during the eye-tracking experiment for each group (low, medium, and high hazard-identification skills) across various types of hazards. Then, multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was used to evaluate the impact of workers' hazard-identification skills on their visual attention. To further investigate the effect of hazard identification skills on the dependent variables (eye movement metrics), two distinct processes followed: separate ANOVAs on each of the dependent variables, and a discriminant function analysis. The analyses indicated that hazard identification skills significantly impact workers' visual search strategies: workers with higher hazard-identification skills had lower dwell-time percentages on ladder-related hazards; higher fixation counts on fall-to-lower-level hazards; and higher fixation counts and run counts on fall-protection systems, struck-by, housekeeping, and all hazardous areas combined. Among the eye-movement metrics studied, fixation count had the largest standardized coefficient in all canonical discriminant functions, which implies that this eye-movement metric uniquely discriminates workers with high hazard-identification skills and at-risk workers. Because discriminant function analysis is similar to regression, discriminant function (linear combinations of eye-movement metrics) can be used to predict workers' hazard-identification capabilities. In conclusion, this study provides a proof of concept that certain eyemovement metrics are predictive indicators of human error due to attentional failure. These outcomes stemmed from a laboratory setting, and, foreseeably, safety managers in the future will be able to use these findings to identify at-risk construction workers, pinpoint required safety training, measure training effectiveness, and eventually improve future personal protective equipment to measure construction workers' situation awareness in real time.

At the UK Atomic Energy Authority's (UKAEA) Remote Applications in Challenging Environments (RACE) facility, we applied the interface in a user study where trained robotics operators completed simulated nuclear monitoring and decommissioning style tasks to compare VR and traditional teleoperation interface designs. We found that operators in the VR condition took longer to complete the experiment, had reduced collisions, and rated the generated 3D map with higher importance when compared to non-VR operators. Additional physiological data suggested that VR operators had a lower objective cognitive workload during the experiment but also experienced increased physical demand. Overall the presented results show that VR interfaces may benefit work patterns in teleoperation tasks within the nuclear industry, but further work is needed to investigate how such interfaces can be integrated into real world decommissioning workflows.","[Stedman, Harvey; Pawar, Vijay M.] UCL, Autonomous Mfg Lab, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kocer, Basaran Bahadir; Kovac, Mirko] Imperial Coll London, Aerial Robot Lab, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Kocer, Basaran Bahadir] Univ Bristol, Dept Aerosp Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [van Zalk, Nejra] Imperial Coll London, Dyson Sch Design Engn, London SW7 1AL, England; [Kovac, Mirko] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Lab Sustainabil Robot, Dubendorf, Switzerland",University of London; University College London; Imperial College London; University of Bristol; Imperial College London; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Stedman, H (corresponding author), UCL, Autonomous Mfg Lab, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,"van Zalk, Nejra/D-8007-2011; Kocer, Bahadir/D-6013-2016","van Zalk, Nejra/0000-0002-3504-9037","EPSRC [EP/R009953/1, EP/L016230/1, EP/R026173/1, EP/S031464/1]; NERC [NE/R012229/1]; EU H2020 AeroTwin project [810321]",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EU H2020 AeroTwin project,"This work was approved by UCL Research Ethics Committee (ID 13305.003).

While promising to substantially improve quality of life across various severe medical conditions, there are also concerns that the convergence of these technologies, e.g., in the form of intelligent neuroprostheses, may have undesirable consequences and compromise cognitive liberty, mental integrity, or mental privacy. Therefore, various international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), have formed initiatives to tackle such questions and develop recommendations that mitigate risks while fostering innovation. In this context, a first international conference on the ethics and regulation of intelligent neuroprostheses was held in Berlin, Germany, in autumn 2023. The conference gathered leading experts in neuroscience, engineering, ethics, law, philosophy as well as representatives of industry, policy making and the media. Here, we summarize the highlights of the conference, underline the areas in which a broad consensus was found among participants, and provide an outlook on future challenges in development, deployment, and regulation of intelligent neuroprostheses.","[Buthut, Maria; Colucci, Annalisa; Vermehren, Mareike; Soekadar, Surjo R.] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci Charite Campus Mitte, Clin Neurotechnol Lab, Berlin, Germany; [Buthut, Maria] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin Inst Hlth, Berlin, Germany; [Starke, Georg; Ienca, Marcello] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Hist & Ethics Med, Fac Med, Munich, Germany; [Starke, Georg; Ienca, Marcello] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Humanities, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Akmazoglu, Tugba Basaran; van Beinum, Amanda; Chandler, Jennifer] Univ Ottawa, Fac Law, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Bublitz, Christoph] Univ Hamburg, Fac Law, Hamburg, Germany",Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Technical University of Munich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Ottawa; University of Hamburg,"Soekadar, SR (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci Charite Campus Mitte, Clin Neurotechnol Lab, Berlin, Germany.",surjo.soekadar@charite.de,"Soekadar, Surjo/AAA-3801-2020; vanBeinum, Amanda/LKJ-9275-2024",,"ERA-NET Neuron under the project HYBRIDMINDS; German Research Foundation (DFG) [SO 932/8-1]; German Ministry of Education and Research (ERA NET Neuron) [01GP2121A]; German Ministry of Education and Research [01GP2121B, CHANSE Q-SHIFT 01UX2211, NEO 13GW0483C, SSMART 01DR21025A, QHMI 03ZU2110FC]; European Research Council (ERC) [759370, 101081905]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG SO932/7-1]; Einstein Foundation Berlin (ESB)",ERA-NET Neuron under the project HYBRIDMINDS; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Ministry of Education and Research (ERA NET Neuron); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Einstein Foundation Berlin (ESB),"The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In this study, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the mechanism through which haze influences the tourism industry, and then we empirically analyze the impact on China's inbound tourism using surface particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations as a proxy for haze, based on provincial panel data from 1998 to 2016. The empirical results show that haze not only has an inhibitory effect on inbound tourism, but also significantly reduces the average length of stay of international tourists. In addition, while there are significant regional differences in the crowding-out effect of haze pollution on inbound tourism, the effect varies depending on the origin of inbound tourists, exhibiting the greatest negative impact on inbound tourism from Taiwan and the smallest from foreign countries. Our research highlights that haze pollution can led to the change of human tourism behavior which enrich the literature on tourism and haze.","[Wu, Wenzhi; Qiu, Fudong] East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xia, Xin] Donghua Univ, Glorious Sun Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cui, Chunyu] Ocean Univ China, Management Coll, Qingdao, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Donghua University; Ocean University of China,"Wu, WZ (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wuwenzhi1980@126.com,,,,,,,86,1,1,15,43,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

However, the gap in the understanding of the closed-loop driver-vehicle interaction often leads to reduced user acceptance. In this article, an optimal torque control law is calculated online in the model predictive control (MPC) framework to guarantee continuous guidance during the steering task. The research contribution is in the integration of an extensive prediction model covering cognitive behavior, neuromuscular dynamics, and the vehicle-steering dynamics, within the MPC-based haptic controller to enhance collaboration. The driver model is composed of a preview cognitive strategy based on a linear-quadratic-gaussian, sensory organs, and neuromuscular dynamics, including muscle coactivation and reflex action. Moreover, an adaptive cost-function algorithm enables dynamic allocation of the control authority. Experiments were performed in a fixed-base driving simulator at Toyota Motor Europe involving 19 participants to evaluate the proposed controller with two different cost functions against a commercial lane keeping assist system as an industry benchmark. The results demonstrate the proposed controller fosters symbiotic driving and reduces driver-vehicle conflicts with respect to a state-of-the-art commercial system, both subjectively and objectively, while still improving the path-tracking performance. Summarising, this article tackles the need to blend human and ADAS control, demonstrating the validity of the proposed strategy.","[Lazcano, Andrea Michelle Rios; Akutain, Xabier Carrera] Toyota Motor Europe, B-1930 Zaventem, Belgium; [Niu, Tenghao; Cole, David] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Shyrokau, Barys] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",Toyota Motor Corporation; University of Cambridge; Delft University of Technology,"Shyrokau, B (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands.",Andrea.Lazcano@toyota-europe.com; tn326@cam.ac.uk; Xabier.Carrera.Akutain@toyota-europe.com; djc13@cam.ac.uk; B.Shyrokau@tudelft.nl,"Shyrokau, Barys/G-5866-2019","Shyrokau, Barys/0000-0003-4530-8853",,,,,30,38,44,11,60,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1083-4435,1941-014X,,IEEE-ASME T MECH,IEEE-ASME Trans.

Also, there is an increased interest in plantation and its effect on the environment. With vast areas suitable for farming, countries are always encouraging farmers through various programs to increase national farming production. However, the vast areas and large farms make it difficult for farmers and workers to continually monitor these broad areas to protect the plants from diseases and various weather conditions. A new concept dubbed Precision Farming has recently surfaced in which the latest technologies play an integral role in the farming process. In this paper, we propose a SMART Drone system equipped with high precision cameras, high computing power with proposed image processing methodologies, and connectivity for precision farming. The SMART system will automatically monitor vast farming areas with precision, identify infected plants, decide on the chemical and exact amount to spray. Besides, the system is connected to the cloud server for sending the images so that the cloud system can generate reports, including prediction on crop yield. The system is equipped with a user-friendly Human Computer Interface (HCI) for communication with the farm base. This multidrone system can process vast areas of farmland daily. The Image processing technique proposed in this paper is a modified ResNet architecture. The system is compared with deep CNN architecture and other machine learning based systems. The ResNet architecture achieves the highest average accuracy of 99.78% on a dataset consisting of 70,295 leaf images for 26 different diseases of 14 plants. The results obtained were compared with the CNN results applied in this paper and other similar techniques in previous literature.

The framework allows operators to control the robot via both End-Effector (EE) and joint movements and to transfer compound shapes accurately to the robot. Seventeen hand gestures, which cover the position and orientation controls of the robotic EE and other auxiliary operations, are designed according to cognitive psychology. Gestures are classified by a deep neural network, which is pre-trained for two-hand pose estimation and fine-tuned on a custom dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 99%. The index finger's pointing direction and the hand's orientation are extracted via 3D hand pose estimation to indicate the robotic EE's moving direction and orientation, respectively. The number of stretched fingers is detected via two-hand pose estimation to represent decimal digits for selecting robot joints and inputting numbers. Finally, we integrate these three manners seamlessly to form a programming framework. We conducted two interaction experiments. The reaction time of the proposed hand gestures in indicating randomly given instructions is significantly less than that of other gesture sets, such as American Sign Language (ASL). The accuracy of our method in compound shape reconstruction is much better than that of hand movement trajectory-based methods, and the operating time is comparable with that of teach pendants.","[Sun, Digang; Zhang, Ping; Chen, Mingxuan] South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Zhang, P (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",cssundg@mail.scut.edu.cn; pzhang@scut.edu.cn; cscmx@mail.scut.edu.cn,"孙, 迪钢/AFH-4481-2022","Sun, Digang/0000-0002-5336-9851",Key Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2019B090915002],Key Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province,This document is the results of the research project funded by the Key Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2019B090915002).,,50,1,1,7,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.
