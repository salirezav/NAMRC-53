A theoretical framework for evaluating mental workload resources in human systems design for manufacturing operations,"As the nature of manufacturing work is changing, requiring more cognitive demands, there is a need to develop system models for measuring and predicting human performance in repetitive task operations. This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATE, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry: This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Profiling cognitive workload in an unmanned vehicle control task with cognitive models and physiological metrics,"In the present study, we use Cognitive Metrics Profiling (CMP) to capture variance in cognitive load within a complex unmanned vehicle control task. We aim to demonstrate convergent validity with existing workload measurement methods, and to decompose workload into constituent cognitive resources to aid in diagnosing causes of workload. A cognitive model of the task was developed and examined to determine the extent to which it could predict behavioral performance, subjective workload, and validated physiological workload metrics. We also examined model activity to draw insights regarding loaded cognitive capacities. We found that composite workload from the model predicted physiological metrics, performance, and subjective workload. Moreover, the model indicates that differences in workload were driven largely by procedural, declarative, and temporal memory demands. We have found preliminary evidence of correspondence between workload predictions of a CMP model and physiological measures of workload. This suggests our approach captures interesting aspects of workload in a complex task environment and may provide a theoretical link between behavioral, physiological, and subjective metrics. This approach may provide a means to design effective workload mitigation interventions and improve decision-making about personnel tasking and automation.","Stevens, CA; Morris, MB; Fisher, CR; Myers, CW",MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY,2023,Article,10.1080/08995605.2022.2130673,4,Psychology,Cognitive workload; computational modeling; EEG; cognitive architecture; memory; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MENTAL WORKLOAD; ACT-R; EEG; ARCHITECTURE; INDEXES,"Profiling cognitive workload in an unmanned vehicle control task with cognitive models and physiological metrics In the present study, we use Cognitive Metrics Profiling (CMP) to capture variance in cognitive load within a complex unmanned vehicle control task.

Determining Cognitive Workload Using Physiological Measurements: Pupillometry and Heart-Rate Variability,"The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing systems has accelerated in recent years, with a shift towards understanding operators' well-being and resilience within the context of creating a human-centric manufacturing environment. In addition to measuring physical workload, monitoring operators' cognitive workload is becoming a key element in maintaining a healthy and high-performing working environment in future digitalized manufacturing systems. The current approaches to the measurement of cognitive workload may be inadequate when human operators are faced with a series of new digitalized technologies, where their impact on operators' mental workload and performance needs to be better understood. Therefore, a new method for measuring and determining the cognitive workload is required. Here, we propose a new method for determining cognitive-workload indices in a human-centric environment. The approach provides a method to define and verify the relationships between the factors of task complexity, cognitive workload, operators' level of expertise, and indirectly, the operator performance level in a highly digitalized manufacturing environment. Our strategy is tested in a series of experiments where operators perform assembly tasks on a Wankel Engine block. The physiological signals from heart-rate variability and pupillometry bio-markers of 17 operators were captured and analysed using eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant differences in both cardiac and pupillometry-based cognitive load indices across the four task complexity levels (rest, low, medium, and high). Notably, these developed indices also provide better indications of cognitive load responding to changes in complexity compared to other measures. Additionally, while experts appear to exhibit lower cognitive loads across all complexity levels, further analysis is required to confirm statistically significant differences. In conclusion, the results from both measurement sensors are found to be compatible and in support of the proposed new approach. Our strategy should be useful for designing and optimizing workplace environments based on the cognitive load experienced by operators.","Ma, XY; Monfared, R; Grant, R; Goh, YM",SENSORS,2024,Article,10.3390/s24062010,2,Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,cognitive workload; task performance; pupillometry; heart-rate variability; cognitive-workload index; STRESS,"Determining Cognitive Workload Using Physiological Measurements: Pupillometry and Heart-Rate Variability The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing systems has accelerated in recent years, with a shift towards understanding operators' well-being and resilience within the context of creating a human-centric manufacturing environment.

Using Past and Present Indicators of Human Workload to Explain Variance in Human Performance,"Cognitive workload is assumed to influence performance due to resource competition. However, there is a lack of evidence for a direct relationship between changes in workload within an individual over time and changes in that individual's performance. We collected performance data using a multiple object-tracking task in which we measured workload objectively in real-time using a modified detection response task. Using a multi-level Bayesian model controlling for task difficulty and past performance, we found strong evidence that workload both during and preceding a tracking trial was predictive of performance, such that higher workload led to poorer performance. These negative workload-performance relationships were remarkably consistent across individuals. Importantly, we demonstrate that fluctuations in workload independent from the task demands accounted for significant performance variation. The outcomes have implications for designing real-time adaptive systems to proactively mitigate human performance decrements, but also highlight the pervasive influence of cognitive workload more generally.","Howard, ZL; Innes, R; Eidels, A; Loft, S",PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,2021,Article,10.3758/s13423-021-01961-6,7,Psychology,Cognitive and attentional control; Attention and executive control; Bayesian statistics; Dual-task performance; MENTAL WORKLOAD; EGO DEPLETION; DISTRACTION; AUTOMATION; ATTENTION; ACCOUNT; MODEL,"Using Past and Present Indicators of Human Workload to Explain Variance in Human Performance Cognitive workload is assumed to influence performance due to resource competition.

Overloaded and at Work: Investigating the Effect of Cognitive Workload on Assembly Task Performance,"Objective This study investigates the effect of cognitive overload on assembly task performance and muscle activity. Background Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. Method Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. Results Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by then-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. Conclusion This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times.

"Assessing the Relationship between Cognitive Workload, Workstation Design, User Acceptance and Trust in Collaborative Robots","Collaborative robots are revolutionising the manufacturing industry and the way workers perform their tasks. When designing shared workspaces between robots and humans, human factors and ergonomics are often overlooked. This study assessed the relationship between cognitive workload, workstation design, user acceptance and trust in collaborative robots. We combined subjective and objective data to evaluate the cognitive workload during an assembly task in three different scenarios in which we manipulated various features of the workstation and interaction modalities. Our results showed that participants experienced a reduction in cognitive workload in each of the three trials, indicating an improvement in cognitive performance. Additionally, we found that user acceptance predicted perceived stress across the trials but did not significantly impact the cognitive workload. Trust was not found to moderate the relationship between cognitive workload and perceived stress.

What do subjective workload scales really measure? Operational and representational solutions to divergence of workload measures,"We examine the continuing use of subjective workload responses to index an operator's state, either by themselves or as part of a collective suite of measurements. Lack of convergence of subjective scales with physiological and performance-based measures calls into question whether there is any unitary workload construct that underpins conscious experience, physiological state and the individual's profile of task-related performance. We examine philosophical and measurement perspectives on the divergence problem, and we consider three possible solutions. First, difficulties in reliable and valid measurement of workload may contribute to divergence but do not fully explain it. Second, workload may be treated operationally: use of specific measures is justified by demonstrating their pragmatic utility in predicting important outcomes. Third, further efforts may be made to develop representational workload measurements that correspond to real empirical phenomena. Application of formal standards for test validity can identify multiple latent constructs supporting subjective workload, including those defining self-regulation in performance contexts.

Real-time prediction of short-timescale fluctuations in cognitive workload,"Human operators often experience large fluctuations in cognitive workload over seconds timescales that can lead to sub-optimal performance, ranging from overload to neglect. Adaptive automation could potentially address this issue, but to do so it needs to be aware of real-time changes in operators' spare cognitive capacity, so it can provide help in times of peak demand and take advantage of troughs to elicit operator engagement. However, it is unclear whether rapid changes in task demands are reflected in similarly rapid fluctuations in spare capacity, and if so what aspects of responses to those demands are predictive of the current level of spare capacity. We used the ISO standard detection response task (DRT) to measure cognitive workload approximately every 4 s in a demanding task requiring monitoring and refueling of a fleet of simulated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We showed that the DRT provided a valid measure that can detect differences in workload due to changes in the number of UAVs. We used cross-validation to assess whether measures related to task performance immediately preceding the DRT could predict detection performance as a proxy for cognitive workload. Although the simple occurrence of task events had weak predictive ability, composite measures that tapped operators' situational awareness with respect to fuel levels were much more effective. We conclude that cognitive workload does vary rapidly as a function of recent task events, and that real-time predictive models of operators' cognitive workload provide a potential avenue for automation to adapt without an ongoing need for intrusive workload measurements.","Boehm, U; Matzke, D; Gretton, M; Castro, S; Cooper, J; Skinner, M; Strayer, D; Heathcote, A",COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS,2021,Article,10.1186/s41235-021-00289-y,8,Psychology,Cognitive workload; Detection response task; Cross-validation; Workload prediction; Human-automation teaming; MENTAL WORKLOAD; MODEL SELECTION; SYSTEM; TASKS; PERFORMANCE; COMPLEXITY,"Real-time prediction of short-timescale fluctuations in cognitive workload Human operators often experience large fluctuations in cognitive workload over seconds timescales that can lead to sub-optimal performance, ranging from overload to neglect.

Validating an abnormal situation prediction model for smart manufacturing in the oil refining industry,"Human beings play an important role in a smart manufacturing economy. The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators' detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner.

We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators' detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.",0.1891543370764795," The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events .

Using Cognitive Workload Analysis to Predict and Mitigate Workload for Training Simulation,"Constructive simulation-based training does not always go according to plan. Instructors observe scenarios and direct adaptive responses to unexpected events. Simulation operators typically use a graphical interface to monitor the scenario and generate specific interventions that implement the instructor's intent. These activities require the operators' attention and cognitive resources, particularly for complex directions and scenarios with multiple entities to monitor. We are developing automated tools to reduce operator workload, thereby increasing the cost effectiveness of training. We use cognitive workload analysis to identify situations in which operators would be overloaded, and to identify the factors that cause the overloading. By identifying workload hot spots, we can target more effective automated support strategies. GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection) is a theoretical framework for workload analysis that has been applied to many modeling and automation applications. We use GOMS to create a detailed characterization of a set of typical monitoring and intervention tasks for fixed-wing air combat training. This enabled us to synthesize predictive models for combinations of these tasks. The models indicate where operators are likely to have difficulty implementing instructor's intent, as well as where operators are unlikely to be able to complete their tasks correctly. We then used these predictive models to guide the development of tools for reducing operator workload, as well as experimental scenarios for evaluating the effectiveness of those tools. This paper discusses the approach to GOMS modeling, as well as the details of how we used the predictive GOMS models to identify cognitive workload limitations. Using illustrative examples representative of fixed-wing air combat training, we describe composition of workload models, construction of combined predictive models, and use of models for development and testing.

Electroencephalographic Workload Indicators During Teleoperation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Shepherding a Swarm of Unmanned Ground Vehicles in Contested Environments,"Background: Although many electroencephalographic (EEG) indicators have been proposed in the literature, it is unclear which of the power bands and various indices are best as indicators of mental workload. Spectral powers (Theta, Alpha, and Beta) and ratios (Beta/(Alpha + Theta), Theta/Alpha, Theta/Beta) were identified in the literature as prominent indicators of cognitive workload. Objective: The aim of the present study is to identify a set of EEG indicators that can be used for the objective assessment of cognitive workload in a multitasking setting and as a foundational step toward a human-autonomy augmented cognition system. Methods: The participants' perceived workload was modulated during a teleoperation task involving an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shepherding a swarm of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Three sources of data were recorded from sixteen participants (n = 16): heart rate (HR), EEG, and subjective indicators of the perceived workload using the Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT). Results: The HR data predicted the scores from ATWIT. Nineteen common EEG features offered a discriminatory power of the four workload setups with high classification accuracy (82.23%), exhibiting a higher sensitivity than ATWIT and HR.

An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Industrial Tasks,"The ongoing trend toward Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary workplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production chain.

Using near infrared spectroscopy and heart rate variability to detect mental overload,"Mental workload is a key factor influencing the occurrence of human error, especially during piloting and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations, where safety depends on the ability of pilots to act appropriately. In particular, excessively high or low mental workload can lead operators to neglect critical information. The objective of the present study is to investigate the potential of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) - a non-invasive method of measuring prefrontal cortex activity - in combination with measurements of heart rate variability (HRV), to predict mental workload during a simulated piloting task, with particular regard to task engagement and disengagement. Twelve volunteers performed a computer-based piloting task in which they were asked to follow a dynamic target with their aircraft, a task designed to replicate key cognitive demands associated with real life ROV operating tasks. In order to cover a wide range of mental workload levels, task difficulty was manipulated in terms of processing load and difficulty of control - two critical sources of workload associated with piloting and remotely operating a vehicle. Results show that both fNIRS and HRV are sensitive to different levels of mental workload; notably, lower prefrontal activation as well as a lower LF/HF ratio at the highest level of difficulty, suggest that these measures are suitable for mental overload detection. Moreover, these latter measurements point toward the existence of a quadratic model of mental workload. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of cognitive workload on decision authority assignment in human-robot collaboration,"Human-robot collaboration in dynamic industrial environments warrants robot flexibility and shifting between tasks. Adaptive robot behavior unavoidably carries decision-making needs regarding task allocation and scheduling. Such decisions can be made either by the human team members or autonomously, by the robot's controlling algorithm. Human authority may help preserve situational awareness but increases mental demands due to increased responsibilities. Conversely, granting authority to the robot can offload the operator, at the cost of reduced intervention readiness. This paper aims to investigate the question of decision authority assignment in a human-robot team, in terms of performance, perceived workload and subjective preference. We hypothesized that the answer is influenced by the cognitive workload imposed on the human operator by the work process. An experiment with 21 participants was conducted, in which decision authority and induced workload through a secondary task were varied between trials. Results confirmed that operators can support the robot better when decision authority is allocated according to their workload. However, operator decision authority (a) may cause inferior performance at any secondary tasks performed in parallel with robot supervision and (b) increases perceived workload. Subjective preference was found to be evenly divided between the two levels of decision authority, and unaffected by task difficulty. In brief, if human-robot team performance is a priority, humans should be granted decision authority when their overall workload allows it. In high-workload conditions, system decision-making algorithms should be developed.

Investigation of Multiple Resource Theory Design Principles on Robot Teleoperation and Workload Management,"Robot interfaces often only use the visual channel. Inspired by Wickens' Multiple Resource Theory, we investigated if the addition of audio elements would reduce cognitive workload and improve performance. Specifically, we designed a search and threat-defusal task (primary) with a memory test task (secondary). Eleven participants - predominantly first responders - were recruited to control a robot to clear all threats in a combination of four conditions of primary and secondary tasks in visual and auditory channels. While we did not find any statistically significant differences in performance or workload across subjects, making it questionable that Multiple Resource Theory could shorten longer-term task completion time and reduce workload. Our results suggest that considering individual differences for splitting interface modalities across multiple channels requires further investigation.","Han, Z; Norton, A; McCann, E; Baraniecki, L; Ober, W; Shane, D; Skinner, A; Yanco, HA",2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA 2021),2021,Proceedings Paper,10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561182,0,Automation & Control Systems; Robotics,; AUTOMATION,"Investigation of Multiple Resource Theory Design Principles on Robot Teleoperation and Workload Management Robot interfaces often only use the visual channel.

Modified pluralistic walkthrough for method evaluation in manufacturing,"This paper presents a mixed evaluation design including quantitative and qualitative datain order to validate the scope, validity, and reliability of a recently developed CLAM method and tool. A central part of the evaluation was the use of a modified pluralistic walkthroughthat was created to better suit the industrial domain. The evaluation of CLAM was performed in a demonstration factory focusing on manufacturing of street scooters and electric pedal cars. The modified walkthrough was conducted on the shop floor, during on-going assembly, which stresses the representativeness of a real-world setting of manufacturing. The modified pluralistic walkthrough functioned accurately as an evaluation method of CLAM and the exhaustive comments and data from the user representatives were very beneficial. The quantitative results show convicting evidence of CLAM's utility for assessing cognitive load while the qualitative results indicate that some modifications have to be made in order to enhance the actual tool in order to avoid misinterpretations resulting in misleading outcomes.

Cognitive task analysis and workload classification,"A B S T R A C T Automation can be utilized to relieve humans of difficult and repetitive tasks in many domains, presenting the opportunity for safer and more efficient systems. This increase in automation has led to new supervisory roles for human operators where humans monitor feedback from autonomous systems and provide input when necessary. Optimizing these roles requires tools for evaluation of task complexity and resulting operator cognitive workload. Cognitive task analysis is a process for modeling the cognitive actions required of a human during a task. This work presents an enhanced version of this process: Cognitive Task Analysis and Workload Classification (CTAWC). The goal of developing CTAWC was to provide a standardized process to decompose cognitive tasks in enough depth to allow for precise identification of sources of cognitive workload. CTAWC has the following advantages over conventional CTA methodology: center dot Integrates standard terminology from existing taxonomies for task classification to describe expected operator cognitive workload during task performance. center dot Provides a framework to evaluate adequate cognitive depth when decomposing cognitive tasks. center dot Provides a standard model upon which to build an empirical study to evaluate task complexity.

Advanced workstations and collaborative robots: exploiting eye-tracking and cardiac activity indices to unveil senior workers' mental workload in assembly tasks,"Introduction: As a result of Industry 5.0's technological advancements, collaborative robots (cobots) have emerged as pivotal enablers for refining manufacturing processes while re-focusing on humans. However, the successful integration of these cutting-edge tools hinges on a better understanding of human factors when interacting with such new technologies, eventually fostering workers' trust and acceptance and promoting low-fatigue work. This study thus delves into the intricate dynamics of human-cobot interactions by adopting a human-centric view.Methods: With this intent, we targeted senior workers, who often contend with diminishing work capabilities, and we explored the nexus between various human factors and task outcomes during a joint assembly operation with a cobot on an ergonomic workstation. Exploiting a dual-task manipulation to increase the task demand, we measured performance, subjective perceptions, eye-tracking indices and cardiac activity during the task. Firstly, we provided an overview of the senior workers' perceptions regarding their shared work with the cobot, by measuring technology acceptance, perceived wellbeing, work experience, and the estimated social impact of this technology in the industrial sector. Secondly, we asked whether the considered human factors varied significantly under dual-tasking, thus responding to a higher mental load while working alongside the cobot. Finally, we explored the predictive power of the collected measurements over the number of errors committed at the work task and the participants' perceived workload.Results: The present findings demonstrated how senior workers exhibited strong acceptance and positive experiences with our advanced workstation and the cobot, even under higher mental strain. Besides, their task performance suffered increased errors and duration during dual-tasking, while the eye behavior partially reflected the increased mental demand. Some interesting outcomes were also gained about the predictive power of some of the collected indices over the number of errors committed at the assembly task, even though the same did not apply to predicting perceived workload levels.Discussion: Overall, the paper discusses possible applications of these results in the 5.0 manufacturing sector, emphasizing the importance of adopting a holistic human-centered approach to understand the human-cobot complex better.","Pluchino, P; Pernice, GFA; Nenna, F; Mingardi, M; Bettelli, A; Bacchin, D; Spagnolli, A; Jacucci, G; Ragazzon, A; Miglioranzi, L; Pettenon, C; Gamberini, L",FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI,2023,Article,10.3389/frobt.2023.1275572,1,Robotics,human factors; ergonomic workstations; collaborative robots; mental workload; psychophysiology; COGNITIVE WORKLOAD; NASA-TLX; DESIGN; ACCEPTANCE; MODEL; TRUST,"Advanced workstations and collaborative robots: exploiting eye-tracking and cardiac activity indices to unveil senior workers' mental workload in assembly tasks Introduction: As a result of Industry 5.0's technological advancements, collaborative robots (cobots) have emerged as pivotal enablers for refining manufacturing processes while re-focusing on humans.
