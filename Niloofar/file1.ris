AB  - Digitalisation and the introduction of smart manufacturing technologies are changing the shape of industrial shop floors. For manufacturing companies, it becomes imperative to assess the operational and economic advantages derived from these technologies. Simultaneously, in alignment with the Industry 5.0 paradigm, understanding the influence of digital technologies on human workers, especially those directly interacting with these technologies, is equally critical. This study focuses on augmented reality (AR) as a specific technology, conducting an experimental campaign to explore its effects on learning curves and cognitive workload. Voluntary participants engaged in learning manual tasks of varying durations and required dexterity. This study evaluates the impact of AR on the mental workload of operators, utilising two main eye-related measures: fixation duration and pupil diameter. Preliminary results indicate that augmented reality increases the cognitive workload of workers undergoing training.

AB  - Manufacturers face the challenge of adopting digital solutions to maintain competitiveness in the era of flexible manufacturing. The human remains a crucial asset in ensuring this flexibility. Industry 5.0 strongly emphasizes human-centric approaches to achieve sustainability and resilience in the industry. Notably, in-line quality inspection stands out among the assembly operations to minimize waste and ensure quality. With the increasing trend toward high-mix low-volume manufacturing, the reliance on operators’ traditional tools and cognitive skills for quality inspections is no longer sufficient. Complexity escalates when manual assemblies involve components of varying sizes. Technologies such as augmented reality and computer vision can potentially support quality inspection in manual assembly. However, successful implementation depends on comprehending the specific requirements of the end users. We propose a qualitative approach to refining the requirements in applied research projects that aim to implement human-centered technologies. The approach was applied in a research project for in-line quality inspection with 18 professionals from two manufacturing companies. We instantiated the method using qualitative methods including questionnaires and focus groups with diverse stakeholders with demonstrations. We further investigated the verification and implementation of our method.

AB  - Industrial settings will be characterized by far-reaching production automation brought about by advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, human assembly workers will need to adapt quickly to new and more complex assembly procedures, which are most likely to increase cognitive workload, or potentially induce overload. Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workers’ cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload.

AB  - Drones are increasingly being used in the construction industry for numerous applications. However, their presence poses safety risks to construction workers who work around them but have limited control and information about these drones. To ensure safety, general construction workers who are not part of the pilot teams should also be able to communicate their concerns with drones effectively and naturally. Despite its importance, research on human-drone communication within construction for non-operator workers is scarce. This study developed and evaluated communication protocols using gesture and speech modalities to ensure safe human-drone interactions for non-operator workers in construction environments. An immersive VR environment replicating construction site dynamics was developed, enabling workers to utilize gesture or speech communication protocols while working with drones. A total of 100 participants were recruited for the user-centered study analysis on an immersive VR construction site, and the safety implications and cognitive loads of both protocols were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that gesture-based communication is more effective than speech-based communication in mitigating risks and alleviating the negative impacts of drones without imposing additional cognitive strain on users on construction sites.

AB  - During human–machine collaboration in manufacturing activities, it is important to provide real-time annotations in the three-dimensional workspace for local workers who may lack relevant experience and knowledge. For example, in MR assembly, workers need to be alerted to avoid entering hazardous areas when manually replacing components. Recently, many researchers have explored various visual cues for expressing physical task progress information in the MR interface of intelligent systems. However, the relationship between the implantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D reconstruction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably.

KW  - House of quality
AB  - Engineers at a large electronics new product initiation site were interested in developing human factors (HF) approaches to help improve assembly quality during two stages of their production assembly design: early design of tasks, fixtures and tooling; and during early ramp-up of new assembly lines at outsourcing sites. Researchers worked in an action research approach with company engineers and ergonomists to integrate HF into both design stages. This paper presents the human factors approaches and discusses the challenges of using human factors to improve assembly quality. For the first stage of early design, a HF-design for assembly (HF-DFA) scorecard was developed with 22 items scored on a 0 (no risk or problem) to 2 (high risk or problems) scale. Items included physical risks, such as grip size and force, movement risks, such as re-grasping or re-orienting, visual risks, such as visual accuracy and inspection difficulty, and cognitive issues such as ability to detect a problem and risk of damage to part or component. High scores were associated with assembly tasks that were both reported as difficult by operators, and also had quality problems. The HF-DFA was adopted as a controlled engineering document and used to proactively score assembly tasks prior to final design of tasks, fixtures and tooling. In the second stage of early ramp, researchers combined the HF-DFA and other HF and performance-based metrics into a modified HF-house of quality (HF-HoQ) approach where the focus was on “worker” requirements rather than the traditional customer requirements. The HF-HoQ was evaluated using video of four identical tasks performed at different outsourcing locations that had a seven-fold difference in defect rates. The HF-HoQ successfully detected the site with the highest defect rate, but not the lowest. The authors recommend further testing and development of approaches that attempt to bring insight from HF to the issue of improving assembly quality.
Relevance to industry
Human factors is broader than injury prevention, and has been linked to assembly quality. Two HF approaches were developed to help improve quality in early design stages and during early ramp-up of assembly lines. Companies are encouraged to develop and evaluate HF approaches for improving assembly quality.

AB  - Rest breaks are necessary for workers to avoid and/or recover from overall fatigue and to preserve their health. The type of assembly layout, either in lines or in cells, is a determining factor for organizing work at manufacturing companies, and it could also influence workers' work break and microbreak times. This study aimed at evaluating rest breaks in serial and cell assembly layout configurations as well as the layout's influence on workers' health. One hundred and twenty workers from a large automobile industry, divided into two groups (series and cells), were measured for their cycle-times and break times through biomechanical exposure analysis and questionnaires to evaluate the behaviors, physical, cognitive, and mental health. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify the distribution of the data with a significance level of p < 0.05. The cell assembly-line layouts had the greatest cycle-time and break time, and the workers had a higher level of physical activity (p < 0.05). The serial assembly-line layouts did not generate major occupational risk, need for rest, reduced capacity for work, or higher levels of stress for the workers. The production layouts differed in relation to the cycle-times for just-in-time manufacturing, but there was no difference in relation to the production demands and to the workers' health.
Relevance to industry
When taken at appropriate times, rest breaks in the workplace can improve workers’ overall health and productive performance, which reduces healthcare costs and improves industrial productivity.

AB  - Industry 5.0, built on the foundation of Industry 4.0, aims to integrate human capabilities and principles for a sustainable and human-centric industrial paradigm. This article proposes a systematic literature review to explore the empirical effects of Industry 4.0/5.0 (I4.0/5.0) technologies on human factors, emphasizing the often overlooked physical, psychological, and cognitive dimensions. The methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, involved a Scopus search spanning from 2005-2023, ultimately resulting in a selection of 15 articles. The preliminary results depict the studied I4.0/5.0 technologies and their impact on workers’ physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects. Some (I4.0/5.0) technologies received significant attention, such as human-robot communication and human-robot interaction, while others remain understudied. The limited number of papers makes it difficult to compare and generalize the empirical results reported. In this regard, we propose avenues for refining this systematic literature review in future research endeavors.

AB  - Nowadays, the number of jobs accessible to impaired people in industries is limited. However, minimum changes in the plant could allow the employment of such individuals. Technology is the way to assist such workers to perform at the best they could and to avoid disabilities to limit their potentialities. This work proposes a supervised stowing system that will allow impaired operators to perform the task of order-picking in cluttered environments, despite their disabilities. Pick and place is the most repetitive and common task in industrial manufacturing and warehouses, requiring complex cognitive skills for robots. In the proposed system, the task is physically executed by a robot, while the mental process of selecting the correct object to pick is demanded to the operator. This action is performed through an easy to use graphical user interface. An experimental campaign has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed assistive robotic system.

AB  - In the realm of smart manufacturing, Augmented Reality (AR) technology has gained increasing attention among researchers and manufacturers due to its practicality and adaptability. For this reason, it has been widely embraced in various industrial fields, especially for helping operators assemble products. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a debate in the research community about how effective AR is for improving user performance in assembly tasks, particularly when using handheld devices. These disparities can be attributed to differences in experimental approaches, such as the frequent use of qualitative methods, the inclusion of non-representative users, and the limited number of comprehensive case studies. In response to this, the paper delved into the benefits of AR applications, with a specific focus on measuring user performance and the cognitive workload perceived by users during assembly activities. To this end, an AR assembly guidance tool has been developed to assist users during assembly tasks, running on a mobile device, specifically a tablet, for freedom of movement and high portability. Experimentation involved the assembly of a comprehensive case study and a diverse user group, allowing the comparison representative users and experienced industrial operators. The results were promising, indicating that AR technology effectively enhances user performance during assembly-guided activities compared to conventional methods, particularly when users are unfamiliar with the task at hand. This study brings valuable insights by addressing previous research limitations and providing strong evidence of AR's positive impact on user performance in real-world assembly scenarios.

This paper explores five industrial cases where Information Support Technology have been conceptualized and developed. These cases have exemplified how digitalized presentation of information can be approached with considerations of operators with varying cognitive work situations and production characteristics. Furthermore, these new technical capabilities have increased the level of cognitive automation to support operators’ individual abilities to perform their work in an increasingly more complex production environment. In conclusion, Information Support Technology in the service of Operator 4.0 is intimately linked with digitalization strategies for transformation towards Industry 4.0.

AB  - Human robot collaboration is becoming the norm in the workplace, due to the benefits robots can bring to efficiency and production. However, this creates highly complex and dynamic workplaces that human operators need to adapt to. Industry 5.0 promotes the use of robotics and smart technologies in a more human-centric way. However, research on how operators are affected by those changes is needed to better understand how to move towards human-centricity. As such, an experimental study was designed and performed on human robot collaborative assembly. The main aim was to investigate the correlation between cognitive load and quality due to collaboration. Here, the preliminary results of the experimental study are presented in order to remark relevant states influencing work allocation. The results showcased the need for better training and more knowledge for the operators, as well as involving operators in process and workplace design. This study helps contribute knowledge on robot implementation and process design for human robot collaboration for both researchers and operations management, as it showcases the need to involve operators in those steps due to the feedback they can provide due to their experience.

AB  - With the progressive digitalization in industrial manufacturing, the usage of complex robotic systems in both intralogistics and production is expected to increase. This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program-synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the programming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in parallel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is the concept used to summarize the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which is profoundly changing the manufacturing systems and business models all over the world. Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.

AB  - Within the framework of Industry 5.0, human factors are essential for enhancing the work conditions and well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart manufacturing systems and machines and increasing production performances. Nevertheless, cognitive ergonomics is often underestimated when implementing advanced industrial human-robot interaction. Thus, this work aims to systematically update, develop, and validate guidelines to assist non-experts in the early stages of the design of anthropocentric and collaborative assembly applications by focusing on the main features that have positively influenced workers' cognitive responses. A methodology for structured development has been proposed. The draft guidelines have been created starting from the outcomes of a systematic and extended screening of the scientific literature. Preliminary validation has been carried out with the help of researchers working in the field. Inputs on comprehensibility and relevance have been gathered to enhance the guidelines. Lastly, a survey was used to examine in depth how international experts in different branches can interpret such guidelines. In total, 108 responders were asked to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the guideline's comprehensibility and provide general comments or suggestions for each guideline. Based on the survey's results, the guidelines have been validated and some have been reviewed and re-written in their final form. The present work highlights that integrating human factors into the design of collaborative applications can significantly bolster manufacturing operations' resilience through inclusivity and system adaptability by enhancing worker safety, ergonomics, and wellbeing.

AB  - The so-called smart manufacturing systems (SMS) combine smart manufacturing technologies, cyber-physical infrastructures, and data control to realize predictive and adaptive behaviours. In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 45–64years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers’ needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers’ wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers’ skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic literature review exploring the impact of human–robot (HR) systems on older workers in manufacturing and logistics industries, drawing insights into how these systems can be optimally designed to address human factors in four key areas—perceptual, physical, cognitive, and psychosocial—aligning with the goals of Industry 5.0. By analyzing 19 articles selected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, we identified both the benefits and challenges that HR systems pose to the aging workforce. We conclude that to achieve Industry 5.0 goals, HR systems must be designed to balance automation with human skills, promoting adaptability and inclusivity tailored to the diverse responses of older workers.

AB  - The population of most developed countries is aging; thus, the median age of the global workforce continues to rise. Human aging often results in a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, which may adversely affect the performance of labor-intensive manufacturing systems. Older workers embody profound experience and refined skills, which are success factors for manufacturing companies. Therefore, it is important for manufacturing companies to ensure that older workers remain active and productive. Identifying the potential of an aging workforce, employing technical assistance systems to meet their needs, customizing work flow processes, imparting proper training, and utilizing their experience and skills may provide a competitive advantage for the company. This paper reviews the relevant literature to understand how aging influences workers’ learning in the manufacturing and service industries and identifies management concepts and technologies suitable to support an active aging workforce. We report preliminary insights and discuss selected papers on how aging influences learning-by-doing, life-long learning, training, and experiential knowledge retention. Finally, we propose some future research directions.

AB  - The adoption of I4.0’s technologies in the work cells accompanied by societal changes calls for new approaches to manage the current production systems. Nevertheless, the current models simulating the behavior of the work cells limit the representation of the operators to the average human, without regard for their individual characteristics, cognitive abilities or psychosocial state. The aim of this paper is to achieve two objectives: firstly, the authors propose a conceptual model for enhancing a human-centered production environment. Secondly, the paper summarizes how the literature characterizes the different dimensions of relations between cognitive and organizational factors. By integrating the collaborative, psychological, social, cognitive, organizational and system performance dimensions, the proposed model focuses on the relationships between these dimensions. Thus, operational models should be closer to the real production environment to improve the design choices of the manufacturing systems.

AB  - Despite on-the-job assistance technology is getting popular in the Smart Operator 4.0 literature, non-routine work also requires highly-skilled and pre-trained workers to prevent serious errors and keep high efficiency and safety levels. The question that motivates this study is: ‘is it possible to train industrial workers for what exactly is coming instead of preparing them for a large set of scenarios - even very unlikely ones?’. This work proposes: (i) a structured On-the-Job Training strategy for non-routine tasks, called ‘training-on-the-go’ or ‘prescriptive training’, according to which a Prescriptive Analytics module schedules the training sessions not long before the actual performance, but only when and if needed; (ii) a proof-of-concept of a game-based training system where virtual scenes and context of an industrial site are faithfully recreated thanks to digital twin data and models; (iii) the use of evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive maps (E-FCM) for the extraction of the workers’ implicit procedural knowledge and for the comparison of mental models of experienced vs. inexperienced workers to assess potential misconceptions or flaws in their decision-making process. This work contributes to the evolution of worker training paradigms and systems from the perspective of human-centric cyber-physical production systems and aims for current gaps in workforce training, i.e. poor timeliness and effectiveness, limited context and industrial information integration, and scarce focus on the experts’ implicit knowledge. An application study with a non-routine task on an offshore oil platform demonstrates how the proposed system facilitates knowledge transfer, offers situational awareness and sustains the workforce competence development process.

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming the roles of humans, technology and work in production systems. Although the level of automation on shop floors increases, it is not always feasible or effective to assign the execution of production tasks to autonomous systems. Where total automation is ineffective, new forms of Human-Technology Integration (HTI), Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) and Augmentation Technologies can empower the workforce and increase overall business productivity. OAS can be conceptualized as systems that interact with operators to augment their cognitive and physical capabilities whilst performing industrial work tasks, resulting in HTI. In order to achieve successful HTI, an organization must make appropriate strategic and operational decisions for its business environment while also effectively managing its operations. Identifying and executing effective managerial decisions and activities for HTI can be aided by using business support, i.e., management tools. However, in industry, the systematic guidance of practitioners in HTI activities remains challenging. This paper addresses the challenge of guiding practitioners in HTI by introducing the Augmented Workforce Canvas (Canvas). Developed through Procedural Action Research (PAR), the Canvas is a strategic technology management tool aimed at systematically guiding users through the complex transformation towards HTI and the future of work on the shop floor. The Canvas takes a value-driven, technology-neutral approach to HTI. The tool begins with an assessment by key stakeholder groups of the set of underlying problems and the required added value of the HTI. It can be used as a methodological framework for industrial researchers to identify their respective contributions to the overall context of HTI in industrial contexts. Building on 39 industry expert interviews, the Canvas was co-designed and developed in 13 workshop sessions, refined and tested in 12 working sessions by industry practitioners, and evaluated in three industry case studies. The Canvas contributes to the development of industrial human-technology systems by placing the value-added for production systems at the heart of management decisions.

AB  - Exhausting manual labor is still predominant in the industrial context. It typically consists in manipulating heavy parts or working in nonergonomic conditions. The resulting work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem to tackle. The most-affected body section is the lumbar spine. Recently, exoskeletons have been identified as a possible non-invasive solution to reduce the impact of low-back pain. State-of-the-art prototypes have been optimized to: follow unconstrained human kinematics, (partially) relieve the load on assisted joints, and allow anthropometric adaptation. Yet, this technology still has limited adoption. Manufacturing optimization may address the following limitations: bulky/heavy resulting designs, complex assembly and maintenance, high manufacturing costs, long procedures for adaptation and wearing, and psychological effects (e.g., cognitive load and usability). In this contribution, the aforementioned issues are tackled improving a previous low-back exoskeleton prototype. In particular, kinematic analysis, Finite-Element-Method, and topological optimization have been combined to obtain a lightweight prototype, testing different materials (Nylon, carbon-fiber reinforced PC/ABS, etc.).We applied both Design for Assembly and Design for Manufacturability. The resulting exoskeleton prototype is described in the paper, ready for end-user field tests

AB  - Over the last few years, there has been a clear evolution in the suppliers of the automotive industry due to constant demands imposed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), systematically requiring an increase in the level of quality and competitiveness of products. The continuous requirement to increase productivity in this sector makes it necessary to modernize technology and the need to monitor all production at a distance, also making the manufacturing process more autonomous. However, more traditional companies in developing countries cannot move abruptly to an integrated production and management system. Thus, it is necessary to establish an industrial implementation strategy for this type of companies. The evolution of the work method on the factory shop-floor must be gradual so that there is a greater effectiveness in the change of working paradigm. This paper aims to establish a model of gradual implementation of industry 4.0 in SMEs currently working in a traditional way, so that workers can have the opportunity to evolve in their cognitive capacities with technological evolution, promoting a symbiosis between technological change and the change of mentality, habits of work and technological knowledge of the workers. In order to test the validity of the model, it was developed a case study, through its implementation in a components’ cutting process for the automotive industry. The progress should follow the whole procedure of assembling and shipping of the intermediate product in order to increase their reliability and monitoring. A production control system based on automation and information was created, which allows the product state to be known in real time, triggering the whole process of logistics and subsequent processing in a completely automatic way. After the implementation of this pilot system, it is much simpler to proceed with the training and technological updating of the workers regarding the following processes.

AB  - Efficient and natural programming strategies play a crucial role in enabling human-guided robotic assembly to adapt quickly to dynamic tasks. The combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twins (DT) has shown promising potential in enhancing the intuitiveness of human–robot interaction while leveraging digital representations of human intelligence to empower robots in manufacturing tasks. However, traditional programming methods lack intuitive interaction and rely heavily on simulation environments or pre-set CAD models, leading to high costs for both initial setup and sim-to-real deployment. On the other hand, existing AR-based robot control methods have primarily focused on the basic movements of robots, overlooking higher-level skills necessary for complex tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces a four-layer system architecture that integrates AR-assisted DT into skill-based robotic assembly scenarios. Additionally, a skill-based and low-code programming system for human-guided robotic assembly is designed and implemented, which incorporates natural human guidance and robot autonomous intelligence to generate adaptive and feasible action plans. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are verified by two case studies and a quantitative experiment comparing to traditional programming methods. The results demonstrate the usability of our AR-assisted DT approach in improving programming efficiency, intuitiveness, and safety for human-guided robotic assembly while reducing cognitive load.

AB  - An emerging shortage of resources fosters a development for strategies for the circularity of products and resources. Due to the different states of returned end-of-life products, the complexity for employees in disassembly increases. This work aims to provide an approach for an optimal allocation of disassembly tasks to individual employees and therefore enable a basis for planning and control in disassembly. At first, a task description is provided based on which a standardized time for operations is considered. Second, a link is created between the task description and the product state. Depending on the product state the time determined prior can be adjusted. Third, human skills are considered in manufacturing. It is assumed that within a production system there are different employees with different, developing skill sets. Based on specific skills, a task-to-person-is conducted. Using the information gathered, a Digital Twin (DT) that includes the human nature of the employees and their state is created to enable a simulation of tasks and thereby also a learning system for “first-time-seen” products. When facing complex tasks, the cognitive load and human's fatigue are decisive for performance and thereby the time required for execution. Completing these steps, a multistage concept is created that enables a more precise disassembly planning that can be shown in the case study on the example of components of electric vehicles.

AB  - Manufacturing ergonomics refers to the application of ergonomic principles and human factors analysis to the design of manufacturing tasks with the final aim to optimize the workers’ wellbeing and guarantee the expected process performance. Traditional design approaches are based on the observation of individual workers performing their jobs, the detection of unnatural postures (e.g., bending, twisting, overextending, rotating), and the definition of late corrective actions according to ergonomic guidelines. Recently, computer-integrated simulations based on virtual prototypes and digital human models (DHMs) can be used to assess manufacturing ergonomics on virtual manikins operating in digital workplaces. Such simulations allow validating different design alternatives and optimizing the workstation design before the creation, and pave the way to a new approach to manufacturing system design. The present paper aims at comparing different computer-integrated set-ups to support the design of human-centred manufacturing workstations. It defines a protocol analysis to support workstation design by analysing both physical and cognitive aspects, and applies the protocol within different digital set-ups. In particular, the study investigates a 2D desktop set-up using standardized DHMs and a 3D immersive mixed reality set-up based on motion capture of real workers’ acting into a mixed environment, comparing them with the traditional approach. An industrial case study focusing on design optimization of a manufacturing workstation in the energy industry is used to test the effectiveness of the two digital set-ups for the definition of re-design actions.

AB  - While cloud services make industrial data convenient, they also expose it to cloud incidents. Operators' error in cloud change activities is a leading factor for cloud incidents, which have received relatively less attention in cloud security research. This study conducted a two-stage research process using an integrated approach to explore the stable individual factors related to cloud change errors. First, in the qualitative research, content analysis based on interviews and historical documents was conducted to extract the operator's cognitive abilities and personality traits and develop hypotheses. Five cognitive abilities and six personality traits were extracted. Second, quantitative research based on an experiment was conducted to test relationships between operators' different types of cloud change errors and 1) cognitive ability and 2) personality traits, respectively. Results of error type comparisons suggested that operators generated more uncorrected errors than corrected errors and more operational errors than omission errors in cloud change activities. The multivariate Poisson regression analysis suggested that cognitive abilities of sustained attention, divided attention, and long-term memory negatively predicted the number of operators' total errors, uncorrected errors, and operational errors. Regarding personality traits, with the increase in resilience capacity and carefulness and the decrease in self-esteem, the number of different types of errors reduced, except for omission errors. Working memory and risk-taking propensity were also significant predictors of the number of uncorrected errors with negative and positive coefficients, respectively. Logical reasoning, emotional stability, and sense of responsibility were not observed as predictors of cloud change errors. The present findings have several implications for the industry and cloud providers to enhance industrial cloud data security regarding human cognitive abilities and personality traits.

Operator 4.0, will have handle and manage different work tasks ranging from learning new tasks to solving difficult problems and initiate changes. To support the operator moving between these tasks a specific strategy for the design of cognitive automation solutions is needed. The suggested strategy has three steps: (1) select assembly modes, (2) choose level of cognitive automation carrier and (3) suggest cognitive automation content. It is important that the operator is part of the design and that the solution supports movement between the modes learning, operational and disruptive modes. The strategy could support manufacturing companies meeting challenges regarding social sustainability e.g. stress, attractive workplaces and demography changes as well as system transparency and complexity.

AB  - The competitiveness of modern manufacturing systems is based on a high production rate and a high level of flexibility. Despite the high level of automation achieved in production systems, flexibility is often provided by human dexterity and the cognitive capabilities of the workforce, as in assembly lines. In the case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In these contexts, a high production rate leads to high physical workload, and job rotation is adopted in order to reduce the ergonomic risk. Traditionally, ergonomics and human performance issues have been investigated separately. However, in the design and scheduling of human-based manufacturing systems, a reliable description of human components is required in order to jointly evaluate production system performance and assess workers׳ risk of MSDs In this paper, the authors propose a model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is a mixed integer programming model allowing for the maximization of production rate jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the OCRA (OCcupational Repetitive Actions) method (ISO 11228-3:2007), widely recognized as an effective tool for the risk assessment of Upper Limb Work related MSDs (UL-WMSDs). Moreover, the different workers׳ performance due to their respective training levels and skills is considered in the problem formulation. The model is applied to an industrial case study. Results show the model׳s capacity to identify optimal job rotation schedules jointly achieving productivity and ergonomic risk goals. Performances of the solutions obtained improve as workforce flexibility increases.

AB  - This paper examines the development of a worker centered cognitive assistance system with variant bound and error code dependent job lists in rework areas. In automated assembly lines, a nearly forward directed and repetitive assembly flow eases the implementation of automation technology like assistance systems. However, the implementation of these technologies at manual rework stations represents a challenge because the repair process is flexible. Hence, the developed system creates job lists dynamically and adapts to the individual worker skill level. This article is structured as follows: Analysis of the initial state, Derivation of requirements, Description of the workflow in the use case, Data preparation for the flexible creation of job lists and configuration of the assistance system, Validation of the user-centered-assistance scenario.

AB  - Cyber-physical productions systems (CPPS) play a fundamental role in the fourth industrial revolution along with human centred design. The consideration of these two factors leads to the concept of human centred cyber-physical production systems (H-CPPSs), which are defined as systems that support humans, machines, and software to integrate virtual and physical worlds. H-CPPS are not intended to substitute for human operators but rather to support and augment their capabilities and ensure their well-being. Limited information currently exists about workstation design from an ergonomic perspective and a proper method for including a workstation in a H-CPPS. This paper proposes a methodology that allows identification of industrial requirements and ergonomic considerations for establishing guidelines to integrate Industry 4.0 principles in the manufacturing shopfloor of large and small-medium enterprises by designing a workstation framework that balances operator well-being and manufacturing productivity. First, this approach evaluates a set of general production tasks from the manufacturing industry, assesses the ergonomic risks during execution and identifies the technological enablers to balance human productivity and well-being. Second, this approach provides a set of guidelines for deploying a generic human centred workstation with ergonomic considerations. Finally, this paper describes a case study in which a human-centred workstation was constructed as a proof of concept of the proposed methodology. Experimental tests were applied to find significant statistical improvements between controlled and experimental scenario. The experimental results determined from the methodological constructed workstation with human-centred considerations contributes to reduce the ergonomic risk on industrial operators without affecting its productivity.

AB  - Industry 4.0 technologies are key elements for companies’ competitiveness. Among these technologies, Augmented Reality (AR) already shows great potential and results to assist workers through a large panel of industrial processes. Latest research suggests that AR systems should meet the user’s needs to deliver a personalized experience and therefore improve the adoption of the technology. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of theoretical guidance to design AR-based assistance capable of delivering both the right level of details of information and the best information design, based on the user’s needs. To address this problematic, we developed a methodology describing the principle of adaptive assistance as well as standard characteristics and criteria to design Augmented Reality-based Adaptive Assistance Systems (ARAAS). We applied this methodology on an industrial maintenance use case in the context of landing gears’ overhaul operation. The feedbacks from different profiles of inspectors underline the usefulness of such system and its capacity to deliver an assistance adapted to their needs.

AB  - This is an investigation into the Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) associated with ship engine room operators. This study looks at the effect of workload. There is a large portion of human error associated with marine incidents. Human error may be considered as a result of additional supplementary tasks on top of an accustomed workload. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of workload on human performance. To achieve this, a TRANSAS simulator series 5000 was used to replicate a real scenario with the addition of workload as a PSF. Each participant engaged in a fault detection and correction task. 20 participants were used for the workload study; all 20 were trained for 3 h to use the engine room software interface. The participants then completed a 30-min ballasting task. During this interaction, 50% of the participants underwent a simulated scenario where the workload was increased. The other 50% were given a standard task. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure the participant's activation levels, more specifically from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of the cerebrum. The results showed an increase in activation of the DLPFC during each phase of the task, this trend was magnified by the addition of increased workload. The results are discussed with respect to human performance during varying workload. From the results of this study, a human classification performance model was developed. This model can be used by the maritime industry to better evaluate and understand human error causation.

AB  - Human beings play an important role in a smart manufacturing economy. The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.

AB  - The increasing complexity and demands of assembly operations in manufacturing has been shown to lead to increased cognitive load in assembly workers. Previous work has outlined the complexity of an assembly worker's situation both in terms of difficulty and speed of work and there have been a few attempts at creating frameworks and methods for understanding the key aspects of what creates increased cognitive load. This paper presents the development of an analytic method, denoted CLAM (Cognitive Load Assessment for Manufacturing), and a tool for assessing cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly. It outlines the journey of the development as well as discusses and problematizes relevant meta-methodological issues paired with method development. The intended contribution of the work is to make a difference in reducing the cognitive load of assembly workers on the shop floor, thus focusing the development on applicability and usability of the tool in practice. With this purpose in mind, focus of the method development has been on the practitioners, i.e. the method should not require any expert knowledge to be applied. The CLAM method and accompanying documentation such as a handbook containing instructions towards using the method and interpreting the results, is available in an online tool.

AB  - The industrial metaverse is an emerging paradigm of integrated information technologies. A human-robot collaboration assembly system is developed using extended reality (XR) and blockchain technologies. This system includes the physical, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) supporting, and blockchain systems. Virtual avatars represent physical operators and mobile robots in the XR environment. The VR system emulates real-time physical operations, facilitating pre-planning, online task optimization, and converting strategic decisions into executable instructions for physical robots. The AR system enhances the cognitive experience of intelligent operators, contributing to decision-making and VR system control through multi-modal interactions. The integration of the VR and AR systems in perception-decision-control enables real-time process optimization and the reverse control of physical operations. The system is implemented using a decentralized blockchain and end-edge-cloud collaborative network architecture to regulate interaction permissions for each scene characters, ensuring systematic functionality, robust communication, and comprehensive data management. A case study of a gearbox assembly is used to demonstrate the system’s development and efficacy. The results indicate the VR system's comprehensive perception and the AR system's detailed insights, yielding reliable information on global and local levels. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and spatiotemporal visualization during VR decision-making provides computational advantages. Incorporating human input into the AR system enables human-in-the-loop operational decision-making, providing optimal instructions to improve human-robot collaboration performance. Notably, the fusion of blockchain and end-edge-cloud architectures augments inter-system data exchange by efficiently managing and processing human-robot interactions and their diverse avatars. This system offers an innovative approach to human-robot collaboration assembly in manufacturing, with implications for analogous contexts.

AB  - The development of suitable defect generation models is crucial in both academia and industry having the dual purpose of predicting defects occurring in manufacturing processes and planning eligible effective quality controls. In manual assembly processes, much research focused on developing approaches to predict operator-generated defects. Today, collaborative robotics is gaining increasing attention in smart factories by contributing to the reduction of operators' physical and cognitive workload and thus enabling improved productivity. The present study proposes a preliminary investigation on defect generation models in a human-robot collaborative environment aiming to compare quality performances achieved in purely manual assembly.

AB  - In the context of the Industry 4.0 approach, applications and solutions supporting monitoring, simulation, optimisation and decision-making in production systems are exponentially growing. These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.

AB  - Wire harness assembly is normally a manual assembly process that poses ergonomic challenges. As a consequence of the rapidly expanding electrification of vehicles and transportation systems, the demand for wire harnesses can be expected to grow radically, further increasing assembly operator challenges. Thus, automating this assembly process is highly prioritised by production engineers. The rapid development of industrial robot technology has enabled more human-robot collaboration possibilities, simplifying the automation of wire harness process tasks. However, successful automation applications involving humans require efficient and safe allocation of tasks between humans and technology. Unfortunately, present assembly system design methods may be obsolete and insufficient in light of the capabilities of emerging automation technologies such as collaborative robots. This paper presents a design and specification methodology for human-centred manufacturing systems and focuses on collaborative assembly operations in complex production systems. A case study on human-robot collaboration provides an application example from a wire-harness collaborative assembly process. The proposed design methodology combines hierarchical task analysis with assessments of cognitive and physical Levels of Automation (LoAc and LoAp). The assessments are then followed by evaluations of the Levels of human-robot Collaboration (LoC) and the Levels of operator Skill requirements (LoSr) respectively. A task allocation matrix supports the identification of possible combinations of automation and collaboration solutions for a human-centred and collaborative wire harness assembly process. System designers and integrators may utilise the design and specification methodology to identify the potential and extent of human-robot collaboration in collaborative manufacturing assembly operations.

AB  - High value manufacturing systems still require ergonomically intensive manual activities. Examples include the aerospace industry where the fitting of pipes and wiring into confined spaces in aircraft wings is still a manual operation. In these environments, workers are subjected to ergonomically awkward forces and postures for long periods of time. This leads to musculoskeletal injuries that severely limit the output of a shopfloor leading to loss of productivity. The use of tools such as wearable sensors could provide a way to track the ergonomics of workers in real time. However, an information processing architecture is required in order to ensure that data is processed in real time and in a manner that meaningful action points are retrieved for use by workers. In this work, based on the Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R) cognitive framework, we propose a Cognitive Architecture for Wearable Sensors (CAWES); a wearable sensor system and cognitive architecture that is capable of taking data streams from multiple wearable sensors on a worker’s body and fusing them to enable digitisation, tracking and analysis of human ergonomics in real time on a shopfloor. Furthermore, through tactile feedback, the architecture is able to inform workers in real time when ergonomics rules are broken. The architecture is validated through the use of an aerospace case study undertaken in laboratory conditions. The results from the validation are encouraging and in the future, further tests will be performed in an actual working environment.

AB  - In the context of intelligent manufacturing and Industry 4.0, the manufacturing industry is rapidly transitioning toward mass personalization production. Despite this trend, the assembly industry still relies on manual operations performed by workers, considering their cognitive ability and flexibility. Thereinto, studying operator action perception and recognition methods is a vital filed and of great significance for improving the production efficiency and ensuring product quality. In this paper, a multi-sensor fusion-based data acquisition system is constructed to address the challenge of achieving comprehensive and accurate perception of the assembly process with a single sensor. Then, an action recognition model architecture based on ResNet + LSTM + D-S evidence theory is proposed and established. By fully considering the characteristics of different data, the multi-sensor data values are maximized, data complementarity is achieved, and the recognition accuracy exceeds 97 %. This research is expected to provide guidance for increasing the degree of workshop automation and improving the efficiency and quality of the production process.

AB  - The integration of neurodiverse operators in industry poses interesting challenges highlighting the potential for human-robot collaboration(HRC) to provide the necessary support and assistance to complete manufacturing tasks. This study proposes a reciprocal learning-based framework to support the operator to carry out assembly tasks via collaborative robot (Cobot) assistance. Such framework includes image acquisition and processing, machine learning (ML)-based classification of workpieces and Cobot operational tasks. An experimental case study is proposed to verify the framework applicability to a number of likely scenarios. Preliminary results show the suitability of HRC systems to effectively aid neurodiverse operator's with memory issues in performing assembly tasks correctly, while at the same time improving the operator's ability to learn the assembly sequence and iteratively improving ML classification accuracy. The potential for intelligent robotics-based increased inclusiveness in manufacturing industry is discussed in terms of benefits to support individuals with cognitive disabilities.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), pivotal in the Industry 4.0 revolution, has transformed manufacturing, particularly assembly lines, by enabling real-time process monitoring and data analysis to enhance productivity. Yet, its potential impact on worker well-being has been less explored. As the National Association of Manufacturers anticipates an opening of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, the necessity for frameworks that not only understand but also improve employee well-being becomes apparent. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive visual emotion recognition framework that incorporates facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotional body posture recognition (EBPR) to assess workers’ psychological states. This initiative aims to mitigate human errors and accidents linked to stress or high cognitive load, thereby enhancing the manufacturing environment. Strategies such as optimized break time planning, line balancing, procedure modifications, and improved training are proposed to ensure both employee well-being and stakeholder benefits. This framework indirectly supports the industry’s efforts to address the looming challenge of unfilled jobs by fostering a supportive work environment that enhances job satisfaction, potentially making positions more appealing and retaining valuable talent. By bridging the gap between technological advancements and human-centric considerations, our approach underscores the significance of integrating IIoT solutions with employee welfare initiatives to address both productivity and workforce sustainability challenges.

AB  - Humans are considered the most valuable resource in manufacturing systems thanks to their craftsmanship, dexterity, and autonomy significantly affecting productivity, quality, and the overall company competitiveness. This paper introduces the SAGE (Systematic Approach to Generating Ergonomic Manufacturing tasks) methodology, a structured approach based on Axiomatic Design principles to integrate Human Factors evaluation early in the operations design phase and redesign manufacturing tasks to improve operators well-being. The primary objective is to mitigate discomfort and safety risks that often lead to musculoskeletal disorders, absenteeism, and production delays. SAGE provides a comprehensive framework for assessing ergonomic aspects of manufacturing tasks and identifying the need for redesign. It offers a detailed set of Functional Requirements (FRs) for reference, assesses FR satisfaction, evaluates task complexity using the Independence Axiom, and examines the intensity of FR satisfaction through the Information Axiom. The methodology includes specific implementation guidelines, ensuring its applicability across diverse manufacturing contexts. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a large-scale parts assembly case study inspired by the bus and coach industrial sector, where a production engineer evaluated a windows assembly task and identified ergonomic design interventions. A comparative analysis with other relevant methods is finally presented, highlighting the approach's effectiveness.

AB  - Product development and manufacturing organizations struggle in their sustainability transformation and do not sufficiently contribute to sustainable production and consumption. Design researchers, at the same time, develop and propose a plethora of new and improved design methods that can support the manufacturing industry in such transformation. It is, despite this, well-documented in literature that the industrial adoption of such proposed design methods is challenging. Previous research in the design domain has mainly studied this issue from a process and methodological perspective, whereas previous research in the management domain instead has focused on organizational, and human-behavioral aspects. This poses a research gap for more interdisciplinary research that studies the adoption of design methods from all three perspectives (i.e., process and methodology, organization, and human behavior). Six parallel case studies were carried out with three different product development and manufacturing organizations to collect qualitative empirical data. Glaserian grounded theory was used to analyze the collected data. This resulted in a descriptive framework that captures 53 interdisciplinary factors influencing the adoption of sustainable design practices using new and improved design methods. The descriptive framework is compared to interdisciplinary literature to further clarify and explain the findings, highlighting both practical and theoretical implications. This research provides three main contributions to theory and practice: (1) Two new concepts are introduced and used to explain the empirical findings, which are referred to as the dualism of design methods, and the situational design problem; (2) Nine systemic barriers and eight propositions are formulated, which highlight the need for a paradigm shift in how design is practiced in industry, how cognitive biases inside organizations can lead to a state of pseudo-sustainability, and the need for improved information and data management capabilities in organizations; (3) Sustainable design thinking is proposed as an potential enabler to address several of the main barriers, as it aims to provide a base competence of sustainable design to systematically challenge cognitive biases inside organizations.

AB  - As collaborative robots become more popular in industry, they are used to collaborate with human workers and free human workers from repeated and heavy work and reduce the risk of physical injuries. However, human workers need to finish tasks that require high cognitive abilities, which increases the risk of mental fatigue. Fatigue can negatively impact workers and even threaten the safety of workers. Currently, the dynamics of human fatigue model are rarely considered. Hence, it is crucial to develop a dynamic allocation method for human-robot collaborative tasks that considers dynamic human fatigue to ensure efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. This paper proposes a task reallocation method for human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model. A fatigue feature extraction method from multimodal data and a fatigue evaluation network are proposed to evaluate the current fatigue status of human workers. Based on the evaluation results, the human fatigue model is dynamically updated. If the worker’s fatigue state changes, a task reallocation scheme is generated by an improved genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning and the dynamic human fatigue model. The experimental results show that the proposed model and algorithm are effective and efficient, and can provide innovative insights for realizing a human-centered manufacturing workshop.

AB  - The importance of training for operators in industrial contexts is widely highlighted in literature. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is considered an efficient solution for training, since it provides immersive, realistic, and interactive simulations environments where the operator can learn-by-doing, far from the risks of the real field. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by several studies, but a proper assessment of the operator’s cognitive response in terms of stress and cognitive load, during the use of such technology, is still lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of user’s cognitive states, suitable for each kind of training in the industrial sector and beyond. Preliminary feasibility analysis refers to virtual training for assembly of agricultural vehicles. The proposed protocol analysis allowed understanding the operators’ loads to optimize the VR training application, considering the mental demand during the training, and thus avoiding stress, mental overload, improving the user performance.

AB  - Industry 5.0 paradigm has renewed interest in the human sphere, emphasizing the importance of workers’ well-being in manufacturing activities. In such context, collaborative robotics originated as a technology to support humans in tiring and repetitive tasks. This study investigates the effects of assembly complexity in Human-Robot collaboration using physiological indicators of cognitive effort. In a series of experiments, participants performed assembly processes of different products with varying complexity, in two modalities: manually and with cobot assistance. Physiological measures, including skin conductance, heart rate variability and eye-tracking metrics were collected. The analysis of physiological signals showed trends suggesting the impact of assembly complexity and cobot support. One key finding of the study is that a single physiological signal usually may not provide a complete understanding of cognitive load. Therefore, a holistic approach should be followed. This approach highlighted the importance of considering multiple measures simultaneously to accurately assess workers’ well-being in industrial environments.

AB  - This study sets out to extend the use of blink rate and pupil size to the assessment of cognitive load of completing common automotive manufacturing tasks. Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks.

AB  - Digital solutions (including Extended Reality as well as web, mobile and AI technologies), among others, are entering a broad variety of industries and modifying the capabilities of operators through (close to) real-time display of context-dependent information. However, little is known with respect to two major issues: (i) how these technologies can be seamlessly integrated for product/process and overall manufacturing system management providing of syntactic, semantic and functional interoperability and reusability among the different manufacturing systems departments; (ii) how they can be conveyed to operators also taking into account the cognitive load that is incurred by the operators. To this end, starting from a previous article (Longo et al., 2017), this article designs and proposes the KNOW4I approach and its practical implementation in an ICT platform (the KNOW4I platform) to further empower the Smart Operators concept. Two major objectives are pursued. The former is to set a standard referred to as the KNOW4I methodological approach for knowledge representation, knowledge management and digital contents management within the Smart Operator domain. The latter is the implementation of the aforementioned approach as part of the KNOW4I platform that includes a suite of Smart Utilities and Objects intelligently and interactively linked with a newly released version of the Sophos-MS digital and intelligent Assistant. Experimentations and results based on multiple KPIs are carried out to account for the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB  - Information support systems for coping with and mastering increasing process complexity are becoming a success factor for many companies. The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0.

By leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research aims to understand the impact of DIAs on assembly processes, emphasizing human-centric design and operational efficiency. The study is novel in considering the three primary objectives: evaluating the technical robustness of DIAs, assessing their effect on operators' cognitive workload and user experience, and determining the overall performance improvement of the assembly process. Methodologically, the research employs a laboratory experiment, incorporating a controlled setting to meticulously assess the DIA's performance. The experiment used a between-subjects design comparing a group of participants using the DIA against a control group relying on traditional manual methods across a series of assembly tasks. Findings reveal a significant enhancement in the operators' experience, a reduction in cognitive load, and an improvement in the quality of process outputs when the DIA is employed. The article contributes to the study of the DIA's potential and AI integration in manufacturing, offering insights into the design, development, and evaluation of DIAs in industrial settings.

These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0. The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training.

AB  - Chemical process industries are hazard intensive. Most industrial accidents occur today due to human error. For safe and efficient operation, it is therefore critical to ensure optimal operator performance. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and concomitant digitalization, the role of operators has become cognitively challenging. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the cognitive performance of operators. One of the major constructs to understand cognitive performance is the cognitive workload. An increase in cognitive workload often leads to degradation in performance. Traditional assessment techniques fail to capture cognitive aspects of performance. Recently, researchers in various domains such as aviation, driving, marine, and nuclear power have started to utilize physiological measures to gauge the cognitive workload of their operators. In our previous works, we have used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking separately to assess the cognitive workload of operators in the process industries. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the benefits of their fusion in classifying process industry control room operators’ workload into low, medium, and high classes while they tackle abnormal situations. The methodology employs the fusion of metrics derived from pupil, gaze, and EEG data to train a decision tree-based model for workload classification. Our results reveal that fusion leads to an increase in classification accuracy of upto 22 %. The work has the potential to identify the expertise level of operators and hence, can be critical in ensuring their optimal performance.

AB  - The last years several methods and sensors have emerged for the assessment of the physical and cognitive loads that human workers experience during the execution of manufacturing tasks. Questionnaires, videos, simulation data, IMU sensors, etc. are some of the data collection methods that can provide important data for the physical (skeleton joint angles, perceived fatigue, covered distance, and so forth), as well as for the cognitive (e.g., perceived user experience, eye movement, latency of movement) workload evaluation. However, there is no commonly accepted method to guide the practitioners in selecting the appropriate method and means to evaluate their task of interest. This paper goes a step further from the existing formal guidelines by considering aspects such as the stage of development of the manufacturing tasks and weighting the cognitive and physical aspects as per the task’s nature. The proposed multi-criteria decision making method will map the custom requirements of each case in terms of cost, time, expertise, and available technology to the ones that each data collection method can meet in order to suggest an appropriate method. The proposed approach is applied in a case study coming from the bus and coach sector, where a mixed task (cognitive and physical effort) is assessed using video recordings and interviews.

AB  - Constantly changing assembly tasks and reduced production cycles increase the risk of cognitive stress of operators. A large number of digital assistance systems implemented in assembly lines contribute to operator’s stress reduction. However, small and medium sized companies confront major challenges in implementing digital assistance solutions due to high investment costs and high customization effort. In addition, technological risks are mainly summarized as i) choosing the right assistance system, ii) realizing suitable interfaces within the in-house IT landscape for machine-to-machine and machine-to-human communication and iii) creating assembly instructions and configuring data systems in terms of supplying specific and adaptable information. Considering the aforementioned challenges and related technological risks, this paper presents a concept for automated data-driven reconfiguration of digital assistance systems. We discuss its impact on certain use cases defined in the TU Wien Pilot Factory Industry 4.0. Finally, we outline learning design principles for students and industrial stakeholders to implement automated reconfigurable digital assistance systems.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is known to be a driving force behind the Industry 4.0. Nowadays the current hype on development and industrial adoption of the AI systems is mostly associated with the deep learning, i.e., with the abilities of the AI to perform various specific cognitive activities better than humans do. However, what about the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), associated with the generic ability of a machine to perform consciously any task that a human can? Do we have many samples of the AGI research adopted by Industry 4.0 and used for smart manufacturing? In this paper, we report the systematic mapping study regarding the AGI-related papers (published during the five-year period) to find out whether AGI is giving up its positions within AI as an attractive tool to address the industry needs. We show what the major concerns of the AGI academic community are nowadays and how the AGI findings have been already or could be potentially applied within the Industry 4.0. We have discovered that the gap between the AGI studies and the industrial needs is still high and even has some indications to grow. However, some AGI-related findings have potential to make real value in smart manufacturing.

AB  - Mental fatigue (MF) is likely to occur in the industrial working population. However, the link between MF and industrial work performance has not been investigated, nor how this interacts with a passive lower back exoskeleton used during industrial work. Therefore, to elucidate its potential effect(s), this study investigated the accuracy of work performance and movement duration through a dual task paradigm and compared results between mentally fatigued volunteers and controls, with and without the exoskeleton. No main effects of MF and the exoskeleton were found. However, when mentally fatigued and wearing the exoskeleton, movement duration significantly increased compared to the baseline condition (βMF:Exo = 0.17, p = .02, ω2 = .03), suggesting an important interaction between the exoskeleton and one's psychobiological state. Importantly, presented data indicate a negative effect on production efficiency through increased performance time. Further research into the cognitive aspects of industrial work performance and human-exoskeleton interaction is therefore warranted.

AB  - Although shop floors become more automated, manual labor is more than the sum of recurring tasks which can simply be executed by autonomous machines. Where total automation is ineffective, operator assistance systems (OAS) could increase productivity and empower the workforce. Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) are systems that interact with operators to modify their cognitive or physical capabilities whilst performing industrial tasks. Given the important role of humans in future manufacturing environments that cannot be automated, production organizations in industry and Human-Technology Integration (HTI) researchers need to understand where OAS can be deployed and what human factors and other human implications arise from their deployment. In short, capturing views from stakeholders who are both affected by and affect the successful implementation of new technologies are essential to align technological innovations with a human-centric perspective. However, based on our literature review of OAS, we find that there are few technology-neutral enquiries on the industrial applicability of OAS. In particular, we note a lack of considerations of the different requirements for OAS resulting from diverse stakeholders in industry, which is expected to be of importance when designing effective HTI. To address this gap, we explore the industrial context of OAS and the perspectives of stakeholder groups across organizations on the applicability of OAS using a multi-method research approach encompassing 27 qualitative expert interviews and ethnographic observations of three industrial contexts. A key finding of our contextual enquiry is that participants expect OAS to be beneficial on shop floors if designed to improve cognitive abilities, such as inductive reasoning. Further, in the case a company seeks to introduce an OAS to augment physical capabilities of operators whilst attached to their bodies, the data indicate a cautious approach is sensible as many operators reject such a form of augmentation. We highlight what our findings mean for HTI research, especially as it relates to consideration of the highly contextual user requirements when developing and integrating human-technology systems for industry.

AB  - Manufacturing Execution Systems are a state-of-the-art technology in industrial companies. Being a core enabler during Industry 4.0, these software solutions are still growing. This is underlined by companies like SAP, that has launched a new cloud-based module for manufacturing execution, even though they already have been well positioned in this market. Due to the amount of opportunities given to interact more with operators via user interfaces, many disciplines use this format for bringing in their information. Information overload for the worker could be the consequence. This paper evaluates the idea of using the results given from tracking the worker’s eye movement to apply classical Lean Management methods for layout optimization, such as 5S. In order to deal with the risk of information overload, the theoretical background of Eye-Tracking and Lean Management are explained. In this paper, the idea as well as its proof of concept is described in the Analysis part. In detail, the resulting Heatmap from worker’s gaze point will be compared with a Spaghetti Diagram and its information for the 5S approach. Thus, further research and suggestions for an experimental design to evaluate the influence of those potential optimizations on the cognitive ergonomics of the operators are discussed.

AB  - This paper is a technical description of a novel Augmented Reality application in the industrial domain of furniture production. In the presented case, workers suffered from high cognitive load in doing end-of-line quality inspection and individual handling of a high variety of products. The proposed solution consists of a Spatial Augmented Reality system, where a projector directly displays information on the product to assist the worker. At the same time results of an in-line quality inspections are shown which can be interactively modified through human gestures. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) in contrast to other industrial augmented reality applications the described one technically builds upon a deep neural net based pose estimation. This allows a seamless interaction with the system and tracking of human actions rather than deriving them from the current state of the work piece, (2) the paper recapitulates experiences and results of the approach with a focus on lessons learned for using human pose estimation in smart production.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration promises to free the human to multitask and engage in cognitive work while the robots assists with physical tasks, therefore increasing productivity. However, this collaborative paradigm requires continuous attention from human operators, which could potentially strain their cognitive resources. Excessive attention demands can lead to safety hazards, increased errors, and reduced efficiency. Despite its critical importance, there is limited empirical research on attentional factors in industrial human-robot collaboration. In this study, we explore attentional multitasking in collaborative human-robot assembly settings. Our experimental setup involves participants performing a wire harnessing task with a collaborative robot while simultaneously completing a Go/No-Go test as a secondary task. To observe the effect of multitasking, we varied the difficulty of the secondary task across two levels and analysed its impacts on work performance and workload. Our results confirm threaded cognition theory, suggesting that human-robot collaboration could reduce cognitive capacity by depleting attentional resources, leading to higher errors and cycle times during multitasking. This underscores the importance of a detailed understanding of attentional factors in human-robot collaboration. We discuss our findings and their implications, and provide insights into the adjustment and design of human-robot collaboration tasks in the industry.

AB  - The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance. This research was funded by the European Community's HORIZON 2020 programme under grant agreement No. 958303 (PENELOPE).

AB  - While ‘Industry 4.0’ drives for greater automation, human factors are still essential in certain domains, especially in industrial disaster management. Despite human factors are frequently cause of individual biases and errors, a systematic quantitative analysis of the correlation between them and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial disaster has never been conducted. The aim of the present study is twofold: to design an original human factors taxonomy, which encompasses all the industrial worker's cognitive capabilities, physical skills, and psychological attitudes; to establish a correlation between each factor and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial emergency. A Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) analysis has been conducted in collaboration with 44 subject matter experts by using an ad-hoc developed tool to investigate, in particular, two types of workers, the role of emergency manager and the emergency team member. Results reveal that the factors have not the same weight in determining the human response performance: cognitive and psychological aspects have a substantial influence on the emergency manager's response performance, while the emergency team member's response performance is more influenced by psychological and physical aspects.
Relevance to industry
Given the crucial role of cognitive, physical and psychological factors in modern human-centred industrial systems and especially in the field of industrial safety & security, this study represents a meticulous guide for safety specialists in the design of disaster management strategies, for recruiters and practitioners in the development of competency-based job descriptions and for new research works for the development of personality-gifted intelligent agents in industrial applications.

AB  - The transition to Industry 5.0 emphasizes the human-centric perspective and pushes for ergonomic risks prevention and mitigation. The diffusion of the production paradigms of mass customization and mass personalization also increases the need for methods and tools to support workers in manufacturing activities. The growing number of product variants requires a higher cognitive load and increases the likelihood of human errors. Work instructions become fundamental, as well as their digitalization. The technologies enabling industry 4.0 have opened up new scenarios for the use of this information, from extended reality to digital assistance systems. This work deals with the human-centered redesign of a workstation for the wire harness assembly with the aim of mitigating the ergonomic risks for operators, both physical and cognitive. Four different scenarios for using the work instructions were implemented and tested: paper-based instructions, workstation display, mixed reality application usable with a head-mounted display, and augmented reality application that only requires a projection system. The experimentation involved user experience evaluation, performance assessment, and objective postural analysis through inertial sensors.

AB  - Hybrid assembly systems combine the advantages of automated assembly solutions with the cognitive abilities of humans to make assembly more flexible while efficient. Adaptive systems in this context enlarge the scope in which the division of tasks between human and machine can be varied. These systems are an enabling factor for agile assembly since highly situation-aware technologies allow quick reaction in volatile assembly situations. This research focuses on the main opportunities and implementation obstacles of adaptive assembly systems in industrial practice. The results of an empirical study, focusing on cognitive worker assistance, with 132 participants from manufacturing companies, are presented in this paper. Main findings show that the introduction of adaptive worker assistance solutions requires extensive modifications of IT infrastructure. Besides an increase in flexibility, an enlarged potential for the improvement of worker training processes is expected.

AB  - In recent years, the affordances of immersive technologies in the industrial context have enabled the onsite worker to have increased potential towards handling the complex procedural and cognitive tasks involved in the strategy of manufacturing an appropriate product. This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper consists in developing an analytical framework to assess the human cognitive capacity occupancy and the human processing time of correct information known as the quality performance. The analytical framework presented allows to assess the human mental workload imposed by the task and how the processing speed of correct information changes when quality performance varies.

AB  - This paper aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of the affordances of Augmented Reality (AR) as a workplace-based learning and training technology in supporting manual or semi-automated manufacturing tasks that involve both complex manipulation and reasoning. Between-subject laboratory experiments involving 20 participants are conducted on a real-life electro-mechanical assembly task to investigate the impacts of various modes of information delivery through AR compared to traditional training methods on task efficiency, number of errors, learning, independence, and cognitive load. The AR application is developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed. Several insights drawn from the experiments and expert interviews are discussed to inform the design of future AR technologies for both training and assisting incumbent and future manufacturing workers on complex manipulation and reasoning tasks.

AB  - Abstract
Existing augmented reality (AR) assembly mainly provides visual instructions for operators from a first-person perspective, and it is hard to share individual working intents for co-located workers on the shop floor, especially for large-scale product assembly task that requires multiple operators working together. To bridge this gap for practical deployments, this paper proposes Co2iAR, a co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative AR assembly. Firstly, according to the stereo visual-inertial fusion strategy, robust and accurate self-contained motion tracking is achieved for the resource-constrained mobile AR platform, followed by a co-located alignment from multiple mobile AR clients on the shop floor. Then, a lightweight text-aware network for online wiring harness character recognition is proposed, as well as the audio-based confirming strategy, enabling natural audio-visual interaction among co-located workers within a shared immersive workplace, which can also monitor the current wiring assembly status and activate the step-by-step tutorials automatically. The novelty of this work is focused on the deployment of audio-visual aware interaction using the same device that is being used to deploy the co-located collaborative AR work instructions, establishing shared operating intents among multiple co-located workers. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on the collaborative performance among multiple AR clients, and results illustrate that the proposed Co2iAR can alleviate the cognitive load and achieve superior performance for the co-located AR assembly tasks, providing a more human-centric collaborative assembly performance.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is one of the paradigms of the emerging Industry 5.0, aimed at supporting humans in production processes. However, the introduction of an industrial robotic system in close contact with a human opens new challenges not only for safety but also for ergonomics. This paper aims to study whether the introduction of a collaborative robot into an assembly process can support the human operator not only physically but also cognitively. To address this research question, shifts of a repetitive assembly process were implemented in both manual and HRC settings. The two settings were compared over time by analyzing the evolution of generated process failures and physiological response, revealing potential differences in process quality and operator stress.

AB  - Human and robot collaboration in assembly tasks is an integral part in modern manufactories. Robots provide advantages in both process and productivity with their repeatability and usability in different tasks, while human operators provide flexibility and can act as safeguards. However, process complexity increases which can lower the overall quality. Increased complexity can negatively influence decision making due to cognitive load on human operators, which can lead to lower quality, be it product, process or human work. Moreover, it can lead to safety risks, human-system error and accidents. In this work, we present the preliminary results on an experiment performed with student-participants, based on an assembly task. The experiment was set up to emulate an industrial assembly, and data collection was performed through qualitative and non-intrusive quantitative methods. Questionnaires were used to assess perceptual task complexity and cognitive load, while a stereo camera provided recordings for after-task analysis on process errors and human work quality based on a 3D skeleton-based human pose estimation and tracking method. The aim of the study is to investigate causes of errors and implications on quality. Future direction of the work is discussed.

AB  - Due to mass customization product variety increased steeply in the automotive industry, entailing the increment of worker’s cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Although worker assistance methods for cognitive automation already exist, they proof insufficient in terms of usability and achieved time saving. Given the rising importance of simulation towards autonomous production planning, a novel approach is proposed using human simulation data in context of worker assistance methods to alleviate cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Within this paper, a new concept for augmented reality-based worker assistance is presented. Additionally, a comparative user study (N=24) was conducted with conventional worker assistance methods to evaluate a prototypical implementation of the concept. The results illustrate the enhancing opportunity of the novel approach to save cognitive abilities and to induce performance improvements. The implementation provided stable information presentation during the entire experiment. However, with regard to the recentness, there has to be carried out further developments and research, concerning performance adaptions and investigations of the effectiveness.

AB  - The ongoing trend toward Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary workplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production chain. Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing the operator’s physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator’s performance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for online assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate the workers’ attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers’ mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics in manufacturing.

AB  - Understanding how skilled workers interact with assistance systems in manufacturing and how they experience the factory environment is fundamental to modeling human interaction and optimizing the processes correctly. This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners’ evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multi-criteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human–machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems.

This is boosting the installation of decentralized and reliable robotics cells with flexible cooperative capabilities. They enroll smart operators’flexibility and robot productivity in collaborative robotics (properly cobots) applications. This paper consists of a state-of-the-art review on cognitive load in manufacturing with characterization of human-robot collaboration. A simulated analysis of a collaborative working cell is performed. An Agent Based (AB) model is presented with application in the automotive sector. The cell consists of logistics AGVs equipped with a manipulator. They interact with working robots and human operator. Robots collaborate in cell and they cooperate with operator on assisted task using Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). The load of human in the collaborative work-cell– set on state of art - is measured according with Functional states over different Behavioral Structures (FBS). We quantified the load of cognitive factors while reporting interaction analysis. Some factors as age and interface complexity and recovery strategy are investigated while reporting their effect on a dynamic variable, i.e., physical stress properly fatigue.

AB  - An immersive Augmented Reality (AR) technology enhances productivity and flexibility in manufacturing by providing real-time instructions within workers’ field of view, aiding in complex tasks. According to cognitive load and attention-based theories, AR guidance can reduce cognitive strain, enhancing task performance. The affordance of AR in industrial processes like assembly or disassembly for repair/maintenance has been exploited broadly. However, the prevailing studies on automated user interfaces for AR instruction development, specifically virtual scene creation and target generation for object mapping rendering, still need to be explored. Notably, production industries currently rely on outsourcing skilled professionals to create AR overlaying instructions using manufacturer input. However, the exactness of the disassembly repository is substantial to avoid defects in AR guidance particulars. This underscores the significance of generalized automated AR instruction development and emphasizes the demands for further research. In this work, the autonomous AR-integrated framework is developed for the disassembly context, empowering manufacturers to acquire desired outcomes across various modules. These modules include the validation of the manual user disassembly sequence repository during the prefatory phase of AR instruction creation and the provision of Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) input. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation/rendering of disassembly efforts in a virtual platform and the generation of rendering virtual display scenes for appropriate AR-guided object mapping. Furthermore, it enables the generation of essential model targets for registering the AR scenes. Subsequently, the extracted repositories (virtual scenes and model targets) are input into the Unity AR tool to create AR mapping guidance for disassembly operations. The performance of the autonomous disassembly module is evaluated through three case studies with different AR visualizations. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed framework is exploited by extracting feedback from experts regarding flexibility, compatibility, completion time, and cognitive level.

AB  - The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs.

AB  - The manufacturing industry is shifting, entering a new era with smart and connected devices. The fourth industrial revolution is promising increased growth and productivity by the Smart Factory and within the enabling technologies is Augmented Reality (AR). At the same time as the technology is introduced, errors in manufacturing are a problem which is affecting the productivity and the quality. This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation- reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems. Furthermore, the empirical findings showed that for managing human errors, the main bottleneck of an AR system is the systems artificial intelligence capabilities.

AB  - In the Industry 4.0 environment, the maintenance of industrial assets is of increasing importance, and, in this domain, the recently emerged technology of Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) is particularly suitable for the satisfaction of today’s manufacturers’ needs for flexibility, dynamism, broad vision of the systems, and responsiveness to stimuli. Although this technology shows considerable potential in supporting the execution of maintenance applications with minimum human intervention, in most cases the to-date technological level is not capable of achieving full automation, making the human role still fundamental in relation to the existing Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In this context, this paper proposes the development of an ontology-based DT aiming at supporting the maintenance fault diagnosis decision-making process in manufacturing systems through the synergistic exploitation of the maintenance ontology KARMA supported by algorithms and database technologies integrated with human knowledge. The solution is meant to enable the cognitive capabilities leading toward the CDT concept. The ontology-based Digital Twin has been applied and assessed in the reality-like facility TELMA, at the Research Center for Automatic Control (CRAN) in Nancy, through the implementation of a fault scenario.

AB  - In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) has been effectively proposed as a tool to support workers in manual procedural tasks in industry, such as assembly and maintenance. It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers’ performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces.

AB  - The cognitive load experienced by humans is an important factor affecting their performance. Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load.

AB  - Cognitive assistance systems enable people to receive valuable support in their industrial work tasks and can offer the highest flexibility and individualization possibilities. The increasing need for knowledge and its growing importance lead to a great demand for user-centric cognitive assistance systems. In this sense, eye-tracking is a potential technology to provide better insights in Use behavior in the task fulfillment process. The analysis of the data contributes to understand where the person is directing their attention, how long they are looking at certain areas and whether potentially unnecessary distractions exist. In this way, data-based adjustments can be specifically identified to be able to increase reliability and efficiency in the process. EyeTracking is rarely used in the development of assistance systems for the manufacturing industry. The expected benefit and the effort remain unclear. We show what potential it can offer in the development of cognitive assistance systems and present recommendations for its integration in the design process. The results are based on the empirical findings of a manual industrial application of complex quality measurement of battery module housings for electric vehicles.

AB  - A smart factory is a form of manufacturing in the era of Industry 4.0 that has adopted new integrated manufacturing technologies. The importance of human–machine interfaces (HMIs) has been increasing due to the complexity of the current manufacturing context. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and understand HMIs in smart factories from a holistic perspective, which enables us to understand the overall picture. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of HMIs to identify smart factory functions, tasks, information types, interaction modalities, and their impact on human operators from the perspectives of human factors and human–computer interaction. Seventy-seven articles were selected for SLR and analysed based on three research questions. We found four smart factory functions (operation and supervision, management, maintenance service, and cybersecurity) consisting of 18 tasks, including subtasks and functions. The effects of these functions, tasks, and HMIs on human operators are also discussed. Five interaction modalities (gaze, voice, gesture, tactile, and haptic) were used to perform these functions and tasks. This paper also discusses the practical use context of HMIs in smart factories and offers HMI recommendations for users, designers, and researchers. These findings provide insights into the design of HMIs in smart factories.

AB  - Telerobotic operation, i.e., a human operator to manipulate remote robotic systems at a distance, has started to gain its popularity in the construction industry. It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye-tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages.

AB  - At present, manufacturing companies are increasingly feeling the need to respond rapidly on the changing customer demands. Mass customization was introduced in order to meet the market’s needs. A direct result of the change in manufacturing strategy is an increase of the complexity for manual assembly operators. Due to a large variety of assembly tasks, the operator is cognitively challenged because he is not supposed to perform every task evenly frequently. This causes an unlearning phase in which the operator’s cycle time increases. Some important learning forgetting models are discussed in this paper to get insights in the phenomenon. Furthermore, different counter strategies against the forgetting effect are listed and discussed. Opportunities and limitations of the strategies were pointed out. An approach for estimating the optimal conditions for retraining is described. A new learning forgetting estimation curve that focuses on mixed-model assembly lines must be introduced. The development of this curve must take into account the task similarity of the product mix and the impact on operator learning and forgetting. Using this estimation, optimal conditions for counter strategies can be proposed. The authors suggest that an experimental study should be used to evaluate the outcome of this approach.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) technologies promise to increase the flexibility and productivity of the workforce by providing real-time information to workers right where it is needed. Following Cognitive Load Theory and Attention Theory, AR assistance can reduce the burden on workers’ mental capacity while performing a task, thereby improving task performance. The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors.

AB  - Industry 5.0 addresses the human challenges of Industry 4.0 as a human-centric solution, placing the worker’s well-being at the centre of the production process. If, on the one hand, the last technologies support operator 5.0 to embrace the collaborative potential of human-machine cooperation, on the other hand, the complexity, as well as the rapid evolution of new technologies, could have the potential to produce immediate stress reaction leading to reduce the workers’ well-being. Recent studies have proved that the maintenance area is experiencing many innovations in terms of approaches and technologies. In this field, the rapid progress of technological equipment is leading to an increase in the human operators’ mental workload. This paper presents preliminary concepts and objectives of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Maintenance Operations. The DSS intends to assist industrial professionals and stakeholders in maintenance tasks characterised by significant cognitive demands. Considering variables such as task complexity and the mental and physical condition of operators involved in a maintenance task, the DSS will provide real-time recommendations for selecting the most suitable operators by promoting a gradual technology introduction, increasing industrial performance, and ensuring the well-being of the workers.

AB  - One of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is focused on decent work and growth which aims to reduce and, finally, remove all barriers for people with a form of diversity like disability. In such a context, manufacturing and production systems should be adapted by adopting specific equipment to help workers with disability while executing jobs according to the type of disability they report. Jobs must be properly planned since disabled workers have physical or cognitive disabilities and specific rights to work. Further, aiming to guarantee a real inclusion of workers with disability production systems should be designed to include these workers in the same working environment as workers without disability. This paper focuses on assembly systems, and it aims to investigate how different designs could impact both the productivity and inclusion of disabled workers. Then, due to the higher variety of products belonging to the same family mixed model assembly systems are considered. For each assembly system design, the daily productivity is calculated by using a simulation approach. Finally, according to the obtained results we provide some considerations about the convenience of adopting parallel flows to guarantee higher inclusion without affecting too much the productivity of the assembly system.

AB  - With the emergence of Industry 5.0, the human-centric manufacturing paradigm requires manufacturing equipment (robots, etc.) interactively assist human workers to deal with dynamic and complex production tasks. To achieve symbiotic human–robot interaction (HRI), the safety issue serves as a prerequisite foundation. Regarding the growing individualized demand of manufacturing tasks, the conventional rule-based safe HRI measures could not well address the safety requirements due to inflexibility and lacking synergy. To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview and collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene.

AB  - Workers play essential roles in manufacturing and logistics. Releasing workers from routine tasks and enabling them to focus on creative, value-adding activities can enhance their performance and wellbeing, and it is also key to the successful implementation of Industry 4.0. One technology that can help identify patterns of worker-system interaction is Eye Tracking (ET), which is a non-intrusive technology for measuring human eye movements. ET can provide moment-by-moment insights into the cognitive state of the subject during task execution, which can improve our understanding of how humans behave and make decisions within complex systems. It also enables explorations of the subject’s interaction mode with the working environment. Earlier research has investigated the use of ET in manufacturing and logistics, but the literature is fragmented and has not yet been discussed in a literature review yet. This article therefore conducts a systematic literature review to explore the applications of ET, summarise its benefits, and outline future research opportunities of using ET in manufacturing and logistics. We first propose a conceptual framework to guide our study and then conduct a systematic literature search in scholarly databases, obtaining 71 relevant papers. Building on the proposed framework, we systematically review the use of ET and categorize the identified papers according to their application in manufacturing (product development, production, quality inspection) and logistics. Our results reveal that ET has several use cases in the manufacturing sector, but that its application in logistics has not been studied extensively so far. We summarize the benefits of using ET in terms of process performance, human performance, and work environment and safety, and also discuss the methodological characteristics of the ET literature as well as typical ET measures used. We conclude by illustrating future avenues for ET research in manufacturing and logistics.

AB  - Within a Human-centric Human-Robot Collaboration (HHRC) system, monitoring, assessing, and optimizing for an operator’s well-being is essential to creating an efficient and comfortable working environment. Currently, monitoring systems are used for independent assessment of human factors. However, the rise of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) has provided the framework for synchronizing multiple operator well-being assessments to create a comprehensive understanding of the operator’s performance and health. Within manufacturing, an operator’s dynamic well-being can be attributed to their physical and cognitive fatigue across the assembly process. As such, we apply non-invasive video understanding techniques to extract relevant assembly process information for automatic physical fatigue assessment. Our novelty involves a video-based fatigue estimation method, in which the boundary-aware dual-stream MS-TCN combined with an LSTM is proposed to detect the operation type, operation repetitions, and the target arm performing each task in an assembly process video. The detected results are then input into our physical fatigue profile to automatically assess the operator’s localized physical fatigue impact. The assembly process of a real-world bookshelf is recorded and tested against, with our algorithm results showing superiority in operation segmentation and target arm detection as opposed to other recent action segmentation models. In addition, we integrate a cognitive fatigue assessment tool that captures operator physiological signals in real-time for body response detection caused by stress. This provides a more robust HDT of the operator for an HHRC system.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration (HRC) plays a crucial role in agile, flexible, and human-centric manufacturing towards the mass personalization transition. Nevertheless, in today’s HRC tasks, either humans or robots need to follow the partners’ commands and instructions along collaborative activities progressing, instead of proactive, mutual engagement. The non-semantic perception of HRC scenarios impedes mutually needed, proactive planning and high-cognitive capabilities in existing HRC systems. To overcome the bottleneck, this research explores a dynamic scene graph-based method for mutual-cognition generation in Proactive HRC applications. Firstly, a spatial-attention object detector is utilized to dynamically perceive objects in industrial settings. Secondly, a linking prediction module is leveraged to construct HRC scene graphs. An attentional graph convolutional network (GCN) is utilized to capture relations between industrial parts, human operators, and robot operations and reason structural connections of human-robot collaborative processing as graph embedding, which links to mutual planners for human operation supports and robot proactive instructions. Lastly, the Proactive HRC implementation is demonstrated on disassembly tasks of aging electronic vehicle batteries (EVBs) and evaluate its mutual-cognition capabilities.

AB  - The transformation process of the industry into a more digitized world is a key challenge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. On the one hand, the advantages of new technologies must be used profitably, on the other hand, the workforce needs to be prepared to deal with new technologies and the complexity and speed that the today's production entails. Worker assistance systems offer the possibility to simplify the interaction between humans and complex machines and to reinforce physical and cognitive skills of employees. Although, worker assistance systems are available on the market, methods, focusing on the systematic selection of appropriate worker assistance systems for specific work tasks and worker types are missing. This paper presents a novel and systematic selection methodology, to analyze and evaluate the workplace, the employee, and the respective work task, based on previously defined parameters. An innovative selection algorithm enables a ranking of potential useful worker assistance systems. Therefore, the proposed novel selection methodology not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge, but also proves to be a helpful tool for practitioners in selecting the right assistance system for both, human workers, and manufacturing operations.
