0,JOUR,How does the application of augmented reality affect the mental workload of human workers? A collection of preliminary results,"['Maretto, Leonardo', 'Battini, Daria', 'Faccio, Maurizio', 'Granata, Irene', 'Jaber, Mohamad Y.']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,58,19,760,765,2024,2024/01/01/,18th IFAC Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing INCOM 2024,2405-8963,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2024.09.210,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896324016331'],"['augmented reality', 'Industry 5.0', 'mental workload', 'digitalisation', 'eye tracking']","Digitalisation and the introduction of smart manufacturing technologies are changing the shape of industrial shop floors. For manufacturing companies, it becomes imperative to assess the operational and economic advantages derived from these technologies. Simultaneously, in alignment with the Industry 5.0 paradigm, understanding the influence of digital technologies on human workers, especially those directly interacting with these technologies, is equally critical. This study focuses on augmented reality (AR) as a specific technology, conducting an experimental campaign to explore its effects on learning curves and cognitive workload. Voluntary participants engaged in learning manual tasks of varying durations and required dexterity. This study evaluates the impact of AR on the mental workload of operators, utilising two main eye-related measures: fixation duration and pupil diameter. Preliminary results indicate that augmented reality increases the cognitive workload of workers undergoing training."

The human remains a crucial asset in ensuring this flexibility. Industry 5.0 strongly emphasizes human-centric approaches to achieve sustainability and resilience in the industry. Notably, in-line quality inspection stands out among the assembly operations to minimize waste and ensure quality. With the increasing trend toward high-mix low-volume manufacturing, the reliance on operators’ traditional tools and cognitive skills for quality inspections is no longer sufficient. Complexity escalates when manual assemblies involve components of varying sizes. Technologies such as augmented reality and computer vision can potentially support quality inspection in manual assembly. However, successful implementation depends on comprehending the specific requirements of the end users. We propose a qualitative approach to refining the requirements in applied research projects that aim to implement human-centered technologies. The approach was applied in a research project for in-line quality inspection with 18 professionals from two manufacturing companies. We instantiated the method using qualitative methods including questionnaires and focus groups with diverse stakeholders with demonstrations. We further investigated the verification and implementation of our method."

Using EEG and EOG measurements for cognitive overload detection in a simulated industrial context","['Morton, Jessica', 'Zheleva, Aleksandra', 'Van Acker, Bram B.', 'Durnez, Wouter', 'Vanneste, Pieter', 'Larmuseau, Charlotte', 'De Bruyne, Jonas', 'Raes, Annelies', 'Cornillie, Frederik', 'Saldien, Jelle', 'De Marez, Lieven', 'Bombeke, Klaas']",Applied Ergonomics,102,,103763,,2022,2022/07/01/,,0003-6870,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103763,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687022000862'],"['Industrial setting', 'Assembly task', 'Cognitive workload', 'Cognitive ergonomics', 'Overload', 'EEG', 'EOG']","Industrial settings will be characterized by far-reaching production automation brought about by advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, human assembly workers will need to adapt quickly to new and more complex assembly procedures, which are most likely to increase cognitive workload, or potentially induce overload. Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workers’ cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload."
3,JOUR,Using gesture and speech communication modalities for safe human-drone interaction in construction,"['Zhu, Zixian', 'Cheng, Jiun-Yao', 'Jeelani, Idris', 'Gheisari, Masoud']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,62,,102827,,2024,2024/10/01/,,1474-0346,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2024.102827,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034624004750'],"['Human-Drone Interaction', 'Gesture', 'Speech', 'Virtual Reality (VR)', 'Safety', 'Drone', 'Construction']","Drones are increasingly being used in the construction industry for numerous applications. However, their presence poses safety risks to construction workers who work around them but have limited control and information about these drones. To ensure safety, general construction workers who are not part of the pilot teams should also be able to communicate their concerns with drones effectively and naturally. Despite its importance, research on human-drone communication within construction for non-operator workers is scarce. This study developed and evaluated communication protocols using gesture and speech modalities to ensure safe human-drone interactions for non-operator workers in construction environments. An immersive VR environment replicating construction site dynamics was developed, enabling workers to utilize gesture or speech communication protocols while working with drones. A total of 100 participants were recruited for the user-centered study analysis on an immersive VR construction site, and the safety implications and cognitive loads of both protocols were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that gesture-based communication is more effective than speech-based communication in mitigating risks and alleviating the negative impacts of drones without imposing additional cognitive strain on users on construction sites."
4,JOUR,Evaluating visual encoding quality of a mixed reality user interface for human–machine co-assembly in complex operational terrain,"['Wang, Zhuo', 'Zhang, Xiangyu', 'Li, Liang', 'Zhou, Yiliang', 'Lu, Zexin', 'Dai, Yuwei', 'Liu, Chaoqian', 'Su, Zekun', 'Bai, Xiaoliang', 'Billinghurst, Mark']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,58,,102171,,2023,2023/10/01/,,1474-0346,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2023.102171,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034623002999'],"['Visual encoding', 'Mixed reality', 'User interface', 'Co-assembly', 'Complex operational terrain']","During human–machine collaboration in manufacturing activities, it is important to provide real-time annotations in the three-dimensional workspace for local workers who may lack relevant experience and knowledge. For example, in MR assembly, workers need to be alerted to avoid entering hazardous areas when manually replacing components. Recently, many researchers have explored various visual cues for expressing physical task progress information in the MR interface of intelligent systems. However, the relationship between the implantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D reconstruction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably."
5,JOUR,Using action research to develop human factors approaches to improve assembly quality during early design and ramp-up of an assembly line,"['Village, J.', 'Salustri, F.A.', 'Neumann, W.P.']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,61,,107,119,2017,2017/09/01/,,0169-8141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2017.05.006,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814117302640'],"['Human factors', 'Ergonomics', 'Production assembly design', 'Quality improvement', 'Design for assembly', 'House of quality']","Engineers at a large electronics new product initiation site were interested in developing human factors (HF) approaches to help improve assembly quality during two stages of their production assembly design: early design of tasks, fixtures and tooling; and during early ramp-up of new assembly lines at outsourcing sites. Researchers worked in an action research approach with company engineers and ergonomists to integrate HF into both design stages. This paper presents the human factors approaches and discusses the challenges of using human factors to improve assembly quality. For the first stage of early design, a HF-design for assembly (HF-DFA) scorecard was developed with 22 items scored on a 0 (no risk or problem) to 2 (high risk or problems) scale. Items included physical risks, such as grip size and force, movement risks, such as re-grasping or re-orienting, visual risks, such as visual accuracy and inspection difficulty, and cognitive issues such as ability to detect a problem and risk of damage to part or component. High scores were associated with assembly tasks that were both reported as difficult by operators, and also had quality problems. The HF-DFA was adopted as a controlled engineering document and used to proactively score assembly tasks prior to final design of tasks, fixtures and tooling. In the second stage of early ramp, researchers combined the HF-DFA and other HF and performance-based metrics into a modified HF-house of quality (HF-HoQ) approach where the focus was on “worker” requirements rather than the traditional customer requirements. The HF-HoQ was evaluated using video of four identical tasks performed at different outsourcing locations that had a seven-fold difference in defect rates. The HF-HoQ successfully detected the site with the highest defect rate, but not the lowest. The authors recommend further testing and development of approaches that attempt to bring insight from HF to the issue of improving assembly quality. Relevance to industry Human factors is broader than injury prevention, and has been linked to assembly quality. Two HF approaches were developed to help improve quality in early design stages and during early ramp-up of assembly lines. Companies are encouraged to develop and evaluate HF approaches for improving assembly quality."
6,JOUR,Manufacturing assembly serial and cells layouts impact on rest breaks and workers’ health,"['de Negreiros, Alexandher Weslley F.T.R.W.', 'Rodrigues da Silva, Patrícia', 'Arezes, Pedro Miguel Ferreira Martins', 'Dangelino, Roberta', 'Padula, Rosimeire Simprini']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,70,,22,27,2019,2019/03/01/,,0169-8141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2019.01.005,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814118301252'],"['Ergonomics', 'Lean production', 'Occupational health', 'Design of systems']","Rest breaks are necessary for workers to avoid and/or recover from overall fatigue and to preserve their health. The type of assembly layout, either in lines or in cells, is a determining factor for organizing work at manufacturing companies, and it could also influence workers' work break and microbreak times. This study aimed at evaluating rest breaks in serial and cell assembly layout configurations as well as the layout's influence on workers' health. One hundred and twenty workers from a large automobile industry, divided into two groups (series and cells), were measured for their cycle-times and break times through biomechanical exposure analysis and questionnaires to evaluate the behaviors, physical, cognitive, and mental health. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify the distribution of the data with a significance level of p < 0.05. The cell assembly-line layouts had the greatest cycle-time and break time, and the workers had a higher level of physical activity (p < 0.05). The serial assembly-line layouts did not generate major occupational risk, need for rest, reduced capacity for work, or higher levels of stress for the workers. The production layouts differed in relation to the cycle-times for just-in-time manufacturing, but there was no difference in relation to the production demands and to the workers' health. Relevance to industry When taken at appropriate times, rest breaks in the workplace can improve workers’ overall health and productive performance, which reduces healthcare costs and improves industrial productivity."

This article proposes a systematic literature review to explore the empirical effects of Industry 4.0/5.0 (I4.0/5.0) technologies on human factors, emphasizing the often overlooked physical, psychological, and cognitive dimensions. The methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, involved a Scopus search spanning from 2005-2023, ultimately resulting in a selection of 15 articles. The preliminary results depict the studied I4.0/5.0 technologies and their impact on workers’ physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects. Some (I4.0/5.0) technologies received significant attention, such as human-robot communication and human-robot interaction, while others remain understudied. The limited number of papers makes it difficult to compare and generalize the empirical results reported. In this regard, we propose avenues for refining this systematic literature review in future research endeavors."

Technology is the way to assist such workers to perform at the best they could and to avoid disabilities to limit their potentialities. This work proposes a supervised stowing system that will allow impaired operators to perform the task of order-picking in cluttered environments, despite their disabilities. Pick and place is the most repetitive and common task in industrial manufacturing and warehouses, requiring complex cognitive skills for robots. In the proposed system, the task is physically executed by a robot, while the mental process of selecting the correct object to pick is demanded to the operator. This action is performed through an easy to use graphical user interface. An experimental campaign has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed assistive robotic system."

For this reason, it has been widely embraced in various industrial fields, especially for helping operators assemble products. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a debate in the research community about how effective AR is for improving user performance in assembly tasks, particularly when using handheld devices. These disparities can be attributed to differences in experimental approaches, such as the frequent use of qualitative methods, the inclusion of non-representative users, and the limited number of comprehensive case studies. In response to this, the paper delved into the benefits of AR applications, with a specific focus on measuring user performance and the cognitive workload perceived by users during assembly activities. To this end, an AR assembly guidance tool has been developed to assist users during assembly tasks, running on a mobile device, specifically a tablet, for freedom of movement and high portability. Experimentation involved the assembly of a comprehensive case study and a diverse user group, allowing the comparison representative users and experienced industrial operators. The results were promising, indicating that AR technology effectively enhances user performance during assembly-guided activities compared to conventional methods, particularly when users are unfamiliar with the task at hand. This study brings valuable insights by addressing previous research limitations and providing strong evidence of AR's positive impact on user performance in real-world assembly scenarios."

This paper explores five industrial cases where Information Support Technology have been conceptualized and developed. These cases have exemplified how digitalized presentation of information can be approached with considerations of operators with varying cognitive work situations and production characteristics. Furthermore, these new technical capabilities have increased the level of cognitive automation to support operators’ individual abilities to perform their work in an increasingly more complex production environment. In conclusion, Information Support Technology in the service of Operator 4.0 is intimately linked with digitalization strategies for transformation towards Industry 4.0."

However, this creates highly complex and dynamic workplaces that human operators need to adapt to. Industry 5.0 promotes the use of robotics and smart technologies in a more human-centric way. However, research on how operators are affected by those changes is needed to better understand how to move towards human-centricity. As such, an experimental study was designed and performed on human robot collaborative assembly. The main aim was to investigate the correlation between cognitive load and quality due to collaboration. Here, the preliminary results of the experimental study are presented in order to remark relevant states influencing work allocation. The results showcased the need for better training and more knowledge for the operators, as well as involving operators in process and workplace design. This study helps contribute knowledge on robot implementation and process design for human robot collaboration for both researchers and operations management, as it showcases the need to involve operators in those steps due to the feedback they can provide due to their experience."

This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program-synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the programming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in parallel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software."

In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines."

A methodology for structured development has been proposed. The draft guidelines have been created starting from the outcomes of a systematic and extended screening of the scientific literature. Preliminary validation has been carried out with the help of researchers working in the field. Inputs on comprehensibility and relevance have been gathered to enhance the guidelines. Lastly, a survey was used to examine in depth how international experts in different branches can interpret such guidelines. In total, 108 responders were asked to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the guideline's comprehensibility and provide general comments or suggestions for each guideline. Based on the survey's results, the guidelines have been validated and some have been reviewed and re-written in their final form. The present work highlights that integrating human factors into the design of collaborative applications can significantly bolster manufacturing operations' resilience through inclusivity and system adaptability by enhancing worker safety, ergonomics, and wellbeing."

In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 45–64years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers’ needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers’ wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers’ skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality."

By analyzing 19 articles selected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, we identified both the benefits and challenges that HR systems pose to the aging workforce. We conclude that to achieve Industry 5.0 goals, HR systems must be designed to balance automation with human skills, promoting adaptability and inclusivity tailored to the diverse responses of older workers."

Human aging often results in a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, which may adversely affect the performance of labor-intensive manufacturing systems. Older workers embody profound experience and refined skills, which are success factors for manufacturing companies. Therefore, it is important for manufacturing companies to ensure that older workers remain active and productive. Identifying the potential of an aging workforce, employing technical assistance systems to meet their needs, customizing work flow processes, imparting proper training, and utilizing their experience and skills may provide a competitive advantage for the company. This paper reviews the relevant literature to understand how aging influences workers’ learning in the manufacturing and service industries and identifies management concepts and technologies suitable to support an active aging workforce. We report preliminary insights and discuss selected papers on how aging influences learning-by-doing, life-long learning, training, and experiential knowledge retention. Finally, we propose some future research directions."

The aim of this paper is to achieve two objectives: firstly, the authors propose a conceptual model for enhancing a human-centered production environment. Secondly, the paper summarizes how the literature characterizes the different dimensions of relations between cognitive and organizational factors. By integrating the collaborative, psychological, social, cognitive, organizational and system performance dimensions, the proposed model focuses on the relationships between these dimensions. Thus, operational models should be closer to the real production environment to improve the design choices of the manufacturing systems."

The question that motivates this study is: ‘is it possible to train industrial workers for what exactly is coming instead of preparing them for a large set of scenarios - even very unlikely ones?’. This work proposes: (i) a structured On-the-Job Training strategy for non-routine tasks, called ‘training-on-the-go’ or ‘prescriptive training’, according to which a Prescriptive Analytics module schedules the training sessions not long before the actual performance, but only when and if needed; (ii) a proof-of-concept of a game-based training system where virtual scenes and context of an industrial site are faithfully recreated thanks to digital twin data and models; (iii) the use of evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive maps (E-FCM) for the extraction of the workers’ implicit procedural knowledge and for the comparison of mental models of experienced vs. inexperienced workers to assess potential misconceptions or flaws in their decision-making process. This work contributes to the evolution of worker training paradigms and systems from the perspective of human-centric cyber-physical production systems and aims for current gaps in workforce training, i.e. poor timeliness and effectiveness, limited context and industrial information integration, and scarce focus on the experts’ implicit knowledge. An application study with a non-routine task on an offshore oil platform demonstrates how the proposed system facilitates knowledge transfer, offers situational awareness and sustains the workforce competence development process."

Although the level of automation on shop floors increases, it is not always feasible or effective to assign the execution of production tasks to autonomous systems. Where total automation is ineffective, new forms of Human-Technology Integration (HTI), Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) and Augmentation Technologies can empower the workforce and increase overall business productivity. OAS can be conceptualized as systems that interact with operators to augment their cognitive and physical capabilities whilst performing industrial work tasks, resulting in HTI. In order to achieve successful HTI, an organization must make appropriate strategic and operational decisions for its business environment while also effectively managing its operations. Identifying and executing effective managerial decisions and activities for HTI can be aided by using business support, i.e., management tools. However, in industry, the systematic guidance of practitioners in HTI activities remains challenging. This paper addresses the challenge of guiding practitioners in HTI by introducing the Augmented Workforce Canvas (Canvas). Developed through Procedural Action Research (PAR), the Canvas is a strategic technology management tool aimed at systematically guiding users through the complex transformation towards HTI and the future of work on the shop floor. The Canvas takes a value-driven, technology-neutral approach to HTI. The tool begins with an assessment by key stakeholder groups of the set of underlying problems and the required added value of the HTI. It can be used as a methodological framework for industrial researchers to identify their respective contributions to the overall context of HTI in industrial contexts. Building on 39 industry expert interviews, the Canvas was co-designed and developed in 13 workshop sessions, refined and tested in 12 working sessions by industry practitioners, and evaluated in three industry case studies. The Canvas contributes to the development of industrial human-technology systems by placing the value-added for production systems at the heart of management decisions."

It typically consists in manipulating heavy parts or working in nonergonomic conditions. The resulting work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem to tackle. The most-affected body section is the lumbar spine. Recently, exoskeletons have been identified as a possible non-invasive solution to reduce the impact of low-back pain. State-of-the-art prototypes have been optimized to: follow unconstrained human kinematics, (partially) relieve the load on assisted joints, and allow anthropometric adaptation. Yet, this technology still has limited adoption. Manufacturing optimization may address the following limitations: bulky/heavy resulting designs, complex assembly and maintenance, high manufacturing costs, long procedures for adaptation and wearing, and psychological effects (e.g., cognitive load and usability). In this contribution, the aforementioned issues are tackled improving a previous low-back exoskeleton prototype. In particular, kinematic analysis, Finite-Element-Method, and topological optimization have been combined to obtain a lightweight prototype, testing different materials (Nylon, carbon-fiber reinforced PC/ABS, etc.).We applied both Design for Assembly and Design for Manufacturability. The resulting exoskeleton prototype is described in the paper, ready for end-user field tests"

The continuous requirement to increase productivity in this sector makes it necessary to modernize technology and the need to monitor all production at a distance, also making the manufacturing process more autonomous. However, more traditional companies in developing countries cannot move abruptly to an integrated production and management system. Thus, it is necessary to establish an industrial implementation strategy for this type of companies. The evolution of the work method on the factory shop-floor must be gradual so that there is a greater effectiveness in the change of working paradigm. This paper aims to establish a model of gradual implementation of industry 4.0 in SMEs currently working in a traditional way, so that workers can have the opportunity to evolve in their cognitive capacities with technological evolution, promoting a symbiosis between technological change and the change of mentality, habits of work and technological knowledge of the workers. In order to test the validity of the model, it was developed a case study, through its implementation in a components’ cutting process for the automotive industry. The progress should follow the whole procedure of assembling and shipping of the intermediate product in order to increase their reliability and monitoring. A production control system based on automation and information was created, which allows the product state to be known in real time, triggering the whole process of logistics and subsequent processing in a completely automatic way. After the implementation of this pilot system, it is much simpler to proceed with the training and technological updating of the workers regarding the following processes."

The combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twins (DT) has shown promising potential in enhancing the intuitiveness of human–robot interaction while leveraging digital representations of human intelligence to empower robots in manufacturing tasks. However, traditional programming methods lack intuitive interaction and rely heavily on simulation environments or pre-set CAD models, leading to high costs for both initial setup and sim-to-real deployment. On the other hand, existing AR-based robot control methods have primarily focused on the basic movements of robots, overlooking higher-level skills necessary for complex tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces a four-layer system architecture that integrates AR-assisted DT into skill-based robotic assembly scenarios. Additionally, a skill-based and low-code programming system for human-guided robotic assembly is designed and implemented, which incorporates natural human guidance and robot autonomous intelligence to generate adaptive and feasible action plans. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are verified by two case studies and a quantitative experiment comparing to traditional programming methods. The results demonstrate the usability of our AR-assisted DT approach in improving programming efficiency, intuitiveness, and safety for human-guided robotic assembly while reducing cognitive load."

Due to the different states of returned end-of-life products, the complexity for employees in disassembly increases. This work aims to provide an approach for an optimal allocation of disassembly tasks to individual employees and therefore enable a basis for planning and control in disassembly. At first, a task description is provided based on which a standardized time for operations is considered. Second, a link is created between the task description and the product state. Depending on the product state the time determined prior can be adjusted. Third, human skills are considered in manufacturing. It is assumed that within a production system there are different employees with different, developing skill sets. Based on specific skills, a task-to-person-is conducted. Using the information gathered, a Digital Twin (DT) that includes the human nature of the employees and their state is created to enable a simulation of tasks and thereby also a learning system for “first-time-seen” products. When facing complex tasks, the cognitive load and human's fatigue are decisive for performance and thereby the time required for execution. Completing these steps, a multistage concept is created that enables a more precise disassembly planning that can be shown in the case study on the example of components of electric vehicles."

Traditional design approaches are based on the observation of individual workers performing their jobs, the detection of unnatural postures (e.g., bending, twisting, overextending, rotating), and the definition of late corrective actions according to ergonomic guidelines. Recently, computer-integrated simulations based on virtual prototypes and digital human models (DHMs) can be used to assess manufacturing ergonomics on virtual manikins operating in digital workplaces. Such simulations allow validating different design alternatives and optimizing the workstation design before the creation, and pave the way to a new approach to manufacturing system design. The present paper aims at comparing different computer-integrated set-ups to support the design of human-centred manufacturing workstations. It defines a protocol analysis to support workstation design by analysing both physical and cognitive aspects, and applies the protocol within different digital set-ups. In particular, the study investigates a 2D desktop set-up using standardized DHMs and a 3D immersive mixed reality set-up based on motion capture of real workers’ acting into a mixed environment, comparing them with the traditional approach. An industrial case study focusing on design optimization of a manufacturing workstation in the energy industry is used to test the effectiveness of the two digital set-ups for the definition of re-design actions."

Operators' error in cloud change activities is a leading factor for cloud incidents, which have received relatively less attention in cloud security research. This study conducted a two-stage research process using an integrated approach to explore the stable individual factors related to cloud change errors. First, in the qualitative research, content analysis based on interviews and historical documents was conducted to extract the operator's cognitive abilities and personality traits and develop hypotheses. Five cognitive abilities and six personality traits were extracted. Second, quantitative research based on an experiment was conducted to test relationships between operators' different types of cloud change errors and 1) cognitive ability and 2) personality traits, respectively. Results of error type comparisons suggested that operators generated more uncorrected errors than corrected errors and more operational errors than omission errors in cloud change activities. The multivariate Poisson regression analysis suggested that cognitive abilities of sustained attention, divided attention, and long-term memory negatively predicted the number of operators' total errors, uncorrected errors, and operational errors. Regarding personality traits, with the increase in resilience capacity and carefulness and the decrease in self-esteem, the number of different types of errors reduced, except for omission errors. Working memory and risk-taking propensity were also significant predictors of the number of uncorrected errors with negative and positive coefficients, respectively. Logical reasoning, emotional stability, and sense of responsibility were not observed as predictors of cloud change errors. The present findings have several implications for the industry and cloud providers to enhance industrial cloud data security regarding human cognitive abilities and personality traits."

Despite the high level of automation achieved in production systems, flexibility is often provided by human dexterity and the cognitive capabilities of the workforce, as in assembly lines. In the case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In these contexts, a high production rate leads to high physical workload, and job rotation is adopted in order to reduce the ergonomic risk. Traditionally, ergonomics and human performance issues have been investigated separately. However, in the design and scheduling of human-based manufacturing systems, a reliable description of human components is required in order to jointly evaluate production system performance and assess workers׳ risk of MSDs In this paper, the authors propose a model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is a mixed integer programming model allowing for the maximization of production rate jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the OCRA (OCcupational Repetitive Actions) method (ISO 11228-3:2007), widely recognized as an effective tool for the risk assessment of Upper Limb Work related MSDs (UL-WMSDs). Moreover, the different workers׳ performance due to their respective training levels and skills is considered in the problem formulation. The model is applied to an industrial case study. Results show the model׳s capacity to identify optimal job rotation schedules jointly achieving productivity and ergonomic risk goals. Performances of the solutions obtained improve as workforce flexibility increases."

The consideration of these two factors leads to the concept of human centred cyber-physical production systems (H-CPPSs), which are defined as systems that support humans, machines, and software to integrate virtual and physical worlds. H-CPPS are not intended to substitute for human operators but rather to support and augment their capabilities and ensure their well-being. Limited information currently exists about workstation design from an ergonomic perspective and a proper method for including a workstation in a H-CPPS. This paper proposes a methodology that allows identification of industrial requirements and ergonomic considerations for establishing guidelines to integrate Industry 4.0 principles in the manufacturing shopfloor of large and small-medium enterprises by designing a workstation framework that balances operator well-being and manufacturing productivity. First, this approach evaluates a set of general production tasks from the manufacturing industry, assesses the ergonomic risks during execution and identifies the technological enablers to balance human productivity and well-being. Second, this approach provides a set of guidelines for deploying a generic human centred workstation with ergonomic considerations. Finally, this paper describes a case study in which a human-centred workstation was constructed as a proof of concept of the proposed methodology. Experimental tests were applied to find significant statistical improvements between controlled and experimental scenario. The experimental results determined from the methodological constructed workstation with human-centred considerations contributes to reduce the ergonomic risk on industrial operators without affecting its productivity."

This study looks at the effect of workload. There is a large portion of human error associated with marine incidents. Human error may be considered as a result of additional supplementary tasks on top of an accustomed workload. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of workload on human performance. To achieve this, a TRANSAS simulator series 5000 was used to replicate a real scenario with the addition of workload as a PSF. Each participant engaged in a fault detection and correction task. 20 participants were used for the workload study; all 20 were trained for 3 h to use the engine room software interface. The participants then completed a 30-min ballasting task. During this interaction, 50% of the participants underwent a simulated scenario where the workload was increased. The other 50% were given a standard task. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure the participant's activation levels, more specifically from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of the cerebrum. The results showed an increase in activation of the DLPFC during each phase of the task, this trend was magnified by the addition of increased workload. The results are discussed with respect to human performance during varying workload. From the results of this study, a human classification performance model was developed. This model can be used by the maritime industry to better evaluate and understand human error causation."

The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems."

A human-robot collaboration assembly system is developed using extended reality (XR) and blockchain technologies. This system includes the physical, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) supporting, and blockchain systems. Virtual avatars represent physical operators and mobile robots in the XR environment. The VR system emulates real-time physical operations, facilitating pre-planning, online task optimization, and converting strategic decisions into executable instructions for physical robots. The AR system enhances the cognitive experience of intelligent operators, contributing to decision-making and VR system control through multi-modal interactions. The integration of the VR and AR systems in perception-decision-control enables real-time process optimization and the reverse control of physical operations. The system is implemented using a decentralized blockchain and end-edge-cloud collaborative network architecture to regulate interaction permissions for each scene characters, ensuring systematic functionality, robust communication, and comprehensive data management. A case study of a gearbox assembly is used to demonstrate the system’s development and efficacy. The results indicate the VR system's comprehensive perception and the AR system's detailed insights, yielding reliable information on global and local levels. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and spatiotemporal visualization during VR decision-making provides computational advantages. Incorporating human input into the AR system enables human-in-the-loop operational decision-making, providing optimal instructions to improve human-robot collaboration performance. Notably, the fusion of blockchain and end-edge-cloud architectures augments inter-system data exchange by efficiently managing and processing human-robot interactions and their diverse avatars.

These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits."

As a consequence of the rapidly expanding electrification of vehicles and transportation systems, the demand for wire harnesses can be expected to grow radically, further increasing assembly operator challenges. Thus, automating this assembly process is highly prioritised by production engineers. The rapid development of industrial robot technology has enabled more human-robot collaboration possibilities, simplifying the automation of wire harness process tasks. However, successful automation applications involving humans require efficient and safe allocation of tasks between humans and technology. Unfortunately, present assembly system design methods may be obsolete and insufficient in light of the capabilities of emerging automation technologies such as collaborative robots. This paper presents a design and specification methodology for human-centred manufacturing systems and focuses on collaborative assembly operations in complex production systems. A case study on human-robot collaboration provides an application example from a wire-harness collaborative assembly process. The proposed design methodology combines hierarchical task analysis with assessments of cognitive and physical Levels of Automation (LoAc and LoAp). The assessments are then followed by evaluations of the Levels of human-robot Collaboration (LoC) and the Levels of operator Skill requirements (LoSr) respectively. A task allocation matrix supports the identification of possible combinations of automation and collaboration solutions for a human-centred and collaborative wire harness assembly process. System designers and integrators may utilise the design and specification methodology to identify the potential and extent of human-robot collaboration in collaborative manufacturing assembly operations."

Examples include the aerospace industry where the fitting of pipes and wiring into confined spaces in aircraft wings is still a manual operation. In these environments, workers are subjected to ergonomically awkward forces and postures for long periods of time. This leads to musculoskeletal injuries that severely limit the output of a shopfloor leading to loss of productivity. The use of tools such as wearable sensors could provide a way to track the ergonomics of workers in real time. However, an information processing architecture is required in order to ensure that data is processed in real time and in a manner that meaningful action points are retrieved for use by workers. In this work, based on the Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R) cognitive framework, we propose a Cognitive Architecture for Wearable Sensors (CAWES); a wearable sensor system and cognitive architecture that is capable of taking data streams from multiple wearable sensors on a worker’s body and fusing them to enable digitisation, tracking and analysis of human ergonomics in real time on a shopfloor. Furthermore, through tactile feedback, the architecture is able to inform workers in real time when ergonomics rules are broken. The architecture is validated through the use of an aerospace case study undertaken in laboratory conditions. The results from the validation are encouraging and in the future, further tests will be performed in an actual working environment."

We introduce a novel, non-intrusive visual emotion recognition framework that incorporates facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotional body posture recognition (EBPR) to assess workers’ psychological states. This initiative aims to mitigate human errors and accidents linked to stress or high cognitive load, thereby enhancing the manufacturing environment. Strategies such as optimized break time planning, line balancing, procedure modifications, and improved training are proposed to ensure both employee well-being and stakeholder benefits.

Hence, it is crucial to develop a dynamic allocation method for human-robot collaborative tasks that considers dynamic human fatigue to ensure efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. This paper proposes a task reallocation method for human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model. A fatigue feature extraction method from multimodal data and a fatigue evaluation network are proposed to evaluate the current fatigue status of human workers. Based on the evaluation results, the human fatigue model is dynamically updated.

In a series of experiments, participants performed assembly processes of different products with varying complexity, in two modalities: manually and with cobot assistance. Physiological measures, including skin conductance, heart rate variability and eye-tracking metrics were collected. The analysis of physiological signals showed trends suggesting the impact of assembly complexity and cobot support. One key finding of the study is that a single physiological signal usually may not provide a complete understanding of cognitive load. Therefore, a holistic approach should be followed.

Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks."

However, little is known with respect to two major issues: (i) how these technologies can be seamlessly integrated for product/process and overall manufacturing system management providing of syntactic, semantic and functional interoperability and reusability among the different manufacturing systems departments; (ii) how they can be conveyed to operators also taking into account the cognitive load that is incurred by the operators. To this end, starting from a previous article (Longo et al., 2017), this article designs and proposes the KNOW4I approach and its practical implementation in an ICT platform (the KNOW4I platform) to further empower the Smart Operators concept. Two major objectives are pursued. The former is to set a standard referred to as the KNOW4I methodological approach for knowledge representation, knowledge management and digital contents management within the Smart Operator domain. The latter is the implementation of the aforementioned approach as part of the KNOW4I platform that includes a suite of Smart Utilities and Objects intelligently and interactively linked with a newly released version of the Sophos-MS digital and intelligent Assistant. Experimentations and results based on multiple KPIs are carried out to account for the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0."

The study is novel in considering the three primary objectives: evaluating the technical robustness of DIAs, assessing their effect on operators' cognitive workload and user experience, and determining the overall performance improvement of the assembly process. Methodologically, the research employs a laboratory experiment, incorporating a controlled setting to meticulously assess the DIA's performance. The experiment used a between-subjects design comparing a group of participants using the DIA against a control group relying on traditional manual methods across a series of assembly tasks. Findings reveal a significant enhancement in the operators' experience, a reduction in cognitive load, and an improvement in the quality of process outputs when the DIA is employed.

The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training."

Most industrial accidents occur today due to human error. For safe and efficient operation, it is therefore critical to ensure optimal operator performance. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and concomitant digitalization, the role of operators has become cognitively challenging. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the cognitive performance of operators. One of the major constructs to understand cognitive performance is the cognitive workload. An increase in cognitive workload often leads to degradation in performance. Traditional assessment techniques fail to capture cognitive aspects of performance. Recently, researchers in various domains such as aviation, driving, marine, and nuclear power have started to utilize physiological measures to gauge the cognitive workload of their operators. In our previous works, we have used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking separately to assess the cognitive workload of operators in the process industries. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the benefits of their fusion in classifying process industry control room operators’ workload into low, medium, and high classes while they tackle abnormal situations. The methodology employs the fusion of metrics derived from pupil, gaze, and EEG data to train a decision tree-based model for workload classification. Our results reveal that fusion leads to an increase in classification accuracy of upto 22 %. The work has the potential to identify the expertise level of operators and hence, can be critical in ensuring their optimal performance."

Questionnaires, videos, simulation data, IMU sensors, etc. are some of the data collection methods that can provide important data for the physical (skeleton joint angles, perceived fatigue, covered distance, and so forth), as well as for the cognitive (e.g., perceived user experience, eye movement, latency of movement) workload evaluation. However, there is no commonly accepted method to guide the practitioners in selecting the appropriate method and means to evaluate their task of interest. This paper goes a step further from the existing formal guidelines by considering aspects such as the stage of development of the manufacturing tasks and weighting the cognitive and physical aspects as per the task’s nature. The proposed multi-criteria decision making method will map the custom requirements of each case in terms of cost, time, expertise, and available technology to the ones that each data collection method can meet in order to suggest an appropriate method. The proposed approach is applied in a case study coming from the bus and coach sector, where a mixed task (cognitive and physical effort) is assessed using video recordings and interviews."

However, what about the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), associated with the generic ability of a machine to perform consciously any task that a human can? Do we have many samples of the AGI research adopted by Industry 4.0 and used for smart manufacturing? In this paper, we report the systematic mapping study regarding the AGI-related papers (published during the five-year period) to find out whether AGI is giving up its positions within AI as an attractive tool to address the industry needs. We show what the major concerns of the AGI academic community are nowadays and how the AGI findings have been already or could be potentially applied within the Industry 4.0. We have discovered that the gap between the AGI studies and the industrial needs is still high and even has some indications to grow.

No main effects of MF and the exoskeleton were found. However, when mentally fatigued and wearing the exoskeleton, movement duration significantly increased compared to the baseline condition (βMF:Exo = 0.17, p = .02, ω2 = .03), suggesting an important interaction between the exoskeleton and one's psychobiological state. Importantly, presented data indicate a negative effect on production efficiency through increased performance time.

Where total automation is ineffective, operator assistance systems (OAS) could increase productivity and empower the workforce. Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) are systems that interact with operators to modify their cognitive or physical capabilities whilst performing industrial tasks. Given the important role of humans in future manufacturing environments that cannot be automated, production organizations in industry and Human-Technology Integration (HTI) researchers need to understand where OAS can be deployed and what human factors and other human implications arise from their deployment. In short, capturing views from stakeholders who are both affected by and affect the successful implementation of new technologies are essential to align technological innovations with a human-centric perspective. However, based on our literature review of OAS, we find that there are few technology-neutral enquiries on the industrial applicability of OAS. In particular, we note a lack of considerations of the different requirements for OAS resulting from diverse stakeholders in industry, which is expected to be of importance when designing effective HTI. To address this gap, we explore the industrial context of OAS and the perspectives of stakeholder groups across organizations on the applicability of OAS using a multi-method research approach encompassing 27 qualitative expert interviews and ethnographic observations of three industrial contexts. A key finding of our contextual enquiry is that participants expect OAS to be beneficial on shop floors if designed to improve cognitive abilities, such as inductive reasoning. Further, in the case a company seeks to introduce an OAS to augment physical capabilities of operators whilst attached to their bodies, the data indicate a cautious approach is sensible as many operators reject such a form of augmentation. We highlight what our findings mean for HTI research, especially as it relates to consideration of the highly contextual user requirements when developing and integrating human-technology systems for industry."

Excessive attention demands can lead to safety hazards, increased errors, and reduced efficiency. Despite its critical importance, there is limited empirical research on attentional factors in industrial human-robot collaboration. In this study, we explore attentional multitasking in collaborative human-robot assembly settings. Our experimental setup involves participants performing a wire harnessing task with a collaborative robot while simultaneously completing a Go/No-Go test as a secondary task. To observe the effect of multitasking, we varied the difficulty of the secondary task across two levels and analysed its impacts on work performance and workload. Our results confirm threaded cognition theory, suggesting that human-robot collaboration could reduce cognitive capacity by depleting attentional resources, leading to higher errors and cycle times during multitasking. This underscores the importance of a detailed understanding of attentional factors in human-robot collaboration. We discuss our findings and their implications, and provide insights into the adjustment and design of human-robot collaboration tasks in the industry."

The aim of the present study is twofold: to design an original human factors taxonomy, which encompasses all the industrial worker's cognitive capabilities, physical skills, and psychological attitudes; to establish a correlation between each factor and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial emergency. A Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) analysis has been conducted in collaboration with 44 subject matter experts by using an ad-hoc developed tool to investigate, in particular, two types of workers, the role of emergency manager and the emergency team member. Results reveal that the factors have not the same weight in determining the human response performance: cognitive and psychological aspects have a substantial influence on the emergency manager's response performance, while the emergency team member's response performance is more influenced by psychological and physical aspects. Relevance to industry Given the crucial role of cognitive, physical and psychological factors in modern human-centred industrial systems and especially in the field of industrial safety & security, this study represents a meticulous guide for safety specialists in the design of disaster management strategies, for recruiters and practitioners in the development of competency-based job descriptions and for new research works for the development of personality-gifted intelligent agents in industrial applications."

This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD."

To bridge this gap for practical deployments, this paper proposes Co2iAR, a co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative AR assembly. Firstly, according to the stereo visual-inertial fusion strategy, robust and accurate self-contained motion tracking is achieved for the resource-constrained mobile AR platform, followed by a co-located alignment from multiple mobile AR clients on the shop floor. Then, a lightweight text-aware network for online wiring harness character recognition is proposed, as well as the audio-based confirming strategy, enabling natural audio-visual interaction among co-located workers within a shared immersive workplace, which can also monitor the current wiring assembly status and activate the step-by-step tutorials automatically. The novelty of this work is focused on the deployment of audio-visual aware interaction using the same device that is being used to deploy the co-located collaborative AR work instructions, establishing shared operating intents among multiple co-located workers. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on the collaborative performance among multiple AR clients, and results illustrate that the proposed Co2iAR can alleviate the cognitive load and achieve superior performance for the co-located AR assembly tasks, providing a more human-centric collaborative assembly performance."

This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners’ evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multi-criteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human–machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems."

According to cognitive load and attention-based theories, AR guidance can reduce cognitive strain, enhancing task performance. The affordance of AR in industrial processes like assembly or disassembly for repair/maintenance has been exploited broadly. However, the prevailing studies on automated user interfaces for AR instruction development, specifically virtual scene creation and target generation for object mapping rendering, still need to be explored. Notably, production industries currently rely on outsourcing skilled professionals to create AR overlaying instructions using manufacturer input. However, the exactness of the disassembly repository is substantial to avoid defects in AR guidance particulars. This underscores the significance of generalized automated AR instruction development and emphasizes the demands for further research. In this work, the autonomous AR-integrated framework is developed for the disassembly context, empowering manufacturers to acquire desired outcomes across various modules. These modules include the validation of the manual user disassembly sequence repository during the prefatory phase of AR instruction creation and the provision of Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) input. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation/rendering of disassembly efforts in a virtual platform and the generation of rendering virtual display scenes for appropriate AR-guided object mapping. Furthermore, it enables the generation of essential model targets for registering the AR scenes. Subsequently, the extracted repositories (virtual scenes and model targets) are input into the Unity AR tool to create AR mapping guidance for disassembly operations. The performance of the autonomous disassembly module is evaluated through three case studies with different AR visualizations. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed framework is exploited by extracting feedback from experts regarding flexibility, compatibility, completion time, and cognitive level."

However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs."

This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation- reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems. Furthermore, the empirical findings showed that for managing human errors, the main bottleneck of an AR system is the systems artificial intelligence capabilities."

It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers’ performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces."

Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load."

The increasing need for knowledge and its growing importance lead to a great demand for user-centric cognitive assistance systems. In this sense, eye-tracking is a potential technology to provide better insights in Use behavior in the task fulfillment process. The analysis of the data contributes to understand where the person is directing their attention, how long they are looking at certain areas and whether potentially unnecessary distractions exist. In this way, data-based adjustments can be specifically identified to be able to increase reliability and efficiency in the process. EyeTracking is rarely used in the development of assistance systems for the manufacturing industry. The expected benefit and the effort remain unclear. We show what potential it can offer in the development of cognitive assistance systems and present recommendations for its integration in the design process. The results are based on the empirical findings of a manual industrial application of complex quality measurement of battery module housings for electric vehicles."

The importance of human–machine interfaces (HMIs) has been increasing due to the complexity of the current manufacturing context. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and understand HMIs in smart factories from a holistic perspective, which enables us to understand the overall picture. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of HMIs to identify smart factory functions, tasks, information types, interaction modalities, and their impact on human operators from the perspectives of human factors and human–computer interaction. Seventy-seven articles were selected for SLR and analysed based on three research questions. We found four smart factory functions (operation and supervision, management, maintenance service, and cybersecurity) consisting of 18 tasks, including subtasks and functions. The effects of these functions, tasks, and HMIs on human operators are also discussed. Five interaction modalities (gaze, voice, gesture, tactile, and haptic) were used to perform these functions and tasks. This paper also discusses the practical use context of HMIs in smart factories and offers HMI recommendations for users, designers, and researchers. These findings provide insights into the design of HMIs in smart factories."

It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye-tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages."

Mass customization was introduced in order to meet the market’s needs. A direct result of the change in manufacturing strategy is an increase of the complexity for manual assembly operators. Due to a large variety of assembly tasks, the operator is cognitively challenged because he is not supposed to perform every task evenly frequently. This causes an unlearning phase in which the operator’s cycle time increases. Some important learning forgetting models are discussed in this paper to get insights in the phenomenon. Furthermore, different counter strategies against the forgetting effect are listed and discussed. Opportunities and limitations of the strategies were pointed out. An approach for estimating the optimal conditions for retraining is described. A new learning forgetting estimation curve that focuses on mixed-model assembly lines must be introduced. The development of this curve must take into account the task similarity of the product mix and the impact on operator learning and forgetting. Using this estimation, optimal conditions for counter strategies can be proposed. The authors suggest that an experimental study should be used to evaluate the outcome of this approach."

Following Cognitive Load Theory and Attention Theory, AR assistance can reduce the burden on workers’ mental capacity while performing a task, thereby improving task performance. The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors."

In this field, the rapid progress of technological equipment is leading to an increase in the human operators’ mental workload. This paper presents preliminary concepts and objectives of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Maintenance Operations. The DSS intends to assist industrial professionals and stakeholders in maintenance tasks characterised by significant cognitive demands. Considering variables such as task complexity and the mental and physical condition of operators involved in a maintenance task, the DSS will provide real-time recommendations for selecting the most suitable operators by promoting a gradual technology introduction, increasing industrial performance, and ensuring the well-being of the workers."

Jobs must be properly planned since disabled workers have physical or cognitive disabilities and specific rights to work. Further, aiming to guarantee a real inclusion of workers with disability production systems should be designed to include these workers in the same working environment as workers without disability. This paper focuses on assembly systems, and it aims to investigate how different designs could impact both the productivity and inclusion of disabled workers. Then, due to the higher variety of products belonging to the same family mixed model assembly systems are considered. For each assembly system design, the daily productivity is calculated by using a simulation approach. Finally, according to the obtained results we provide some considerations about the convenience of adopting parallel flows to guarantee higher inclusion without affecting too much the productivity of the assembly system."

To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview and collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene."

Releasing workers from routine tasks and enabling them to focus on creative, value-adding activities can enhance their performance and wellbeing, and it is also key to the successful implementation of Industry 4.0. One technology that can help identify patterns of worker-system interaction is Eye Tracking (ET), which is a non-intrusive technology for measuring human eye movements. ET can provide moment-by-moment insights into the cognitive state of the subject during task execution, which can improve our understanding of how humans behave and make decisions within complex systems. It also enables explorations of the subject’s interaction mode with the working environment. Earlier research has investigated the use of ET in manufacturing and logistics, but the literature is fragmented and has not yet been discussed in a literature review yet. This article therefore conducts a systematic literature review to explore the applications of ET, summarise its benefits, and outline future research opportunities of using ET in manufacturing and logistics. We first propose a conceptual framework to guide our study and then conduct a systematic literature search in scholarly databases, obtaining 71 relevant papers. Building on the proposed framework, we systematically review the use of ET and categorize the identified papers according to their application in manufacturing (product development, production, quality inspection) and logistics. Our results reveal that ET has several use cases in the manufacturing sector, but that its application in logistics has not been studied extensively so far. We summarize the benefits of using ET in terms of process performance, human performance, and work environment and safety, and also discuss the methodological characteristics of the ET literature as well as typical ET measures used. We conclude by illustrating future avenues for ET research in manufacturing and logistics."

Currently, monitoring systems are used for independent assessment of human factors. However, the rise of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) has provided the framework for synchronizing multiple operator well-being assessments to create a comprehensive understanding of the operator’s performance and health. Within manufacturing, an operator’s dynamic well-being can be attributed to their physical and cognitive fatigue across the assembly process. As such, we apply non-invasive video understanding techniques to extract relevant assembly process information for automatic physical fatigue assessment. Our novelty involves a video-based fatigue estimation method, in which the boundary-aware dual-stream MS-TCN combined with an LSTM is proposed to detect the operation type, operation repetitions, and the target arm performing each task in an assembly process video. The detected results are then input into our physical fatigue profile to automatically assess the operator’s localized physical fatigue impact. The assembly process of a real-world bookshelf is recorded and tested against, with our algorithm results showing superiority in operation segmentation and target arm detection as opposed to other recent action segmentation models. In addition, we integrate a cognitive fatigue assessment tool that captures operator physiological signals in real-time for body response detection caused by stress. This provides a more robust HDT of the operator for an HHRC system."

The non-semantic perception of HRC scenarios impedes mutually needed, proactive planning and high-cognitive capabilities in existing HRC systems. To overcome the bottleneck, this research explores a dynamic scene graph-based method for mutual-cognition generation in Proactive HRC applications. Firstly, a spatial-attention object detector is utilized to dynamically perceive objects in industrial settings. Secondly, a linking prediction module is leveraged to construct HRC scene graphs. An attentional graph convolutional network (GCN) is utilized to capture relations between industrial parts, human operators, and robot operations and reason structural connections of human-robot collaborative processing as graph embedding, which links to mutual planners for human operation supports and robot proactive instructions.

As a basis of the mutual empathy, the understanding of a human operator’s intention has been primarily studied through the technique of human action recognition. Existing deep learning-based methods demonstrate remarkable efficacy in handling information-rich data such as physiological measurements and videos, where the latter category represents a more natural perception input. However, deploying these methods in new unseen assembly scenarios requires first collecting abundant case-specific data. This leads to significant manual effort and poor flexibility. To deal with the issue, this paper proposes a novel cross-domain few-shot learning method for data-efficient multimodal human action recognition. A hierarchical data fusion mechanism is designed to jointly leverage the skeletons, RGB images and depth maps with complementary information. Then a temporal CrossTransformer is developed to enable the action recognition with very limited amount of data. Lightweight domain adapters are integrated to further improve the generalization with fast finetuning. Extensive experiments on a real car engine assembly case show the superior performance of proposed method over state-of-the-art regarding both accuracy and finetuning efficiency. Real-time demonstrations and ablation study further indicate the potential of early recognition, which is beneficial for the robot procedures generation in practical applications. In summary, this paper contributes to the rarely explored realm of data-efficient human action recognition for proactive human–robot collaboration."

The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept.

Modern IP-enabled sensors, actuators, and controllers are transforming industrial automation into industry 5.0 compliances to attain full autonomy with minimal human intervention. With these emerging technologies, Smart Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) is the most important part of the fourth industrial revolution, where diffident programmed embedded systems are networked together to perform, computation, communication, control, and actuation. In this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous architecture for SCPS, where different electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes can be integrated to execute hybrid process dynamics. The proposed architecture is enabled to separate all aspects like computation, control, communication, and actuation, of a process dynamic by estimating the process disturbances, sensor delay, actuator delay, and conversion delay. The allotment of computational embedded cores to different physical processes is done through voltage frequency islands (VFI) with high modularity which is different for different processes. All the mapped process dynamics are optimized through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). The best implementation of the proposed architecture is the upcoming era of industry 5.0 where human intervention is also in a fold in various industries like petroleum, fertilizer, paper, cement, space exploration, and automobile manufacturing."

We draw from a case study on glass tempering that includes a machine-vision-based quality control system and an advanced automation process control system. Based on task analysis and background literature, we develop the concept of hybrid intelligence that implies balanced AI transparency that supports upskilling and resilience. So-called fragmented intelligence, in turn, may result from the combination of the complexity of advanced automation along with the complexity of the process physics that places critical emphasis on expert knowledge. This combination can result in the so-called “double black box effect”, given that designing for understandability for the line workers might not be feasible: expert networks are needed for resilience."

Nonetheless, Industry 5.0 will inevitably face the great challenges such as large scale connectivity and explosive data traffic because of the proliferation of IoT devices. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based overlay cognitive radio (OCR) network for Industry 5.0. Specifically, the hybrid full-duplex (FD)/ half-duplex (HD) mode at the secondary user (SR) is adopted and in-phase and quadrature phase imbalance (IQI) is introduced to better comply with the practical scenarios. We investigate the outage probability (OP) and ergodic sum rate (ESR) of the considered network with the Nakagami-m channels. Extensive simulation experiments are performed to verify the accuracy of the analysis. From the simulation results, we can conclude: i) Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), OP decreases but ESR increases and tends to a fixed value at high SNR regimes, indicating that the existence of IQI leads to a ceiling for the ESR; ii) The primary system has higher reliable performance at low SNR regions when SR is in FD mode, and for ergodicity, the system with FD relay is superior to HD relay; iii) The reliable performance of OMA system for primary users will be better since there is no interference at the relay."

However, the lack of real-time information sharing during HMWS implementation and operation, coupled with uncertainties stemming from human instability and the complexities introduced by smart networking environments in the context of I4.0, poses challenges to the synchronous coordination of this distributed human-centric manufacturing system. Failure in synchronization not only compromises overall system integrity, leading to unrealistic decision-making and potential harm to human health but also goes against the principles of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which proposes placing human well-being at the center of the production process for human-centric smart manufacturing in the future. In this context, this research presents real-time data-driven hyper objects orchestrating for the human-machine synchronization (RHYTHMS) based on a service-oriented human-to-machine architecture (SOH2M) and a model reference adaptive fuzzy control for real-time information sharing and synchronous coordination of the smart HMWS.

One of the major challenges of using this architecture in real-life use cases is the lack of reliable implementations of the symbolic and cognitive layers. On another parallel stream, the adoption of cognitive and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in industries has been slow. One of the reasons for this is the fact that the current generation of AI architectures does not sufficiently take care of the perception levels of the human operator. This paper presents an architecture that solves both of the above challenges. We propose a cognitive architecture where a natural-human in loop replaces most of the symbolic and cognitive layers. At the same time, we propose the use of instrumentation to measure the perceptual level of the human in real-time. This enables us to bridge the symbolic non-symbolic gap to some extent as well. Lastly, the perception-centric block also adds a novel attribute to the existing AI architectures. The current generation of AI algorithms does not incorporate the users’ perception as an integral part of the training and operation of the algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first time user perception is an essential part of the algorithm. We call this architecture Perception-Centric Human-in-loop Cognitive Architecture (PeC-HiCA). PeC-HiCA is not only a more implementable cognitive architecture, it will also be more successful in industrial applications."

Augmented Reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMD) offer a unique platform for providing instructions and additional information superimposed in the work environment and thus can provide guidance in a cognitively ergonomic way. A particular advantage compared to other computing platforms is that the operators have free hands and can perform the manual work and follow guidance simultaneously. We present an evaluation of a prototype that dynamically transforms a CAD data file with design and measurements of wooden trusses to be manufactured, into an AR-based guidance system developed in Unity for Microsoft HoloLens 2 devices. We used an iterative participatory design process for prototyping and think-aloud protocol combined with observations for evaluation, involving professional assemblers in different stages of the process.

This work presents a cognitive architecture composed of perception and reasoning modules that allows a robot to adapt its actions while collaborating with humans in an assembly task. Human action recognition perception is performed using convolutional neural network models with inertial measurement unit and skeleton tracking data. The action predictions are used for task status reasoning which predicts the time left for each action in a task allowing a robot to plan future actions. The task status reasoning uses a recurrent neural network method which is developed for transferability to new actions and tasks. Updateable input parameters allowing the system to optimise for each user and task with each trial performed are also investigated. Finally, the complete system is demonstrated with the collaborative assembly of a small chair and wooden box, along with a solo robot task of stacking objects performed when it would otherwise be idle. The human actions recognised are using a screw driver, Allen key, hammer and hand screwing, with online accuracies between 83–92%. User trials demonstrate the robot deciding when to start collaborative actions in order to synchronise with the user, as well as deciding when it has time to complete an action on its solo task before a collaborative action is required."

Training enhances the operator's understanding of the process, which is then encapsulated as mental models. Typically, the operator's learning in traditional training programs is assessed using expert judgment or in terms of process- and operator action-based metrics. These assessment schemes, however, ignore the cognitive aspects of learning, such as mental model development and cognitive workload. The HMM-based model proposed in Part 1 offers a systematic way to quantify operators' cognition during abnormalities. In this Part 2, we show that the cognitive behaviors displayed by expert operators can be represented as target values on the HMM's state transitions and emission probability distributions. Further, we propose two axioms of learning that can capture the evolution of the operator's mental models as they learn the causal relationships in the process and gain expertise in handling abnormal situations. We validate the proposed axioms by conducting training experiments involving 10 participants performing 486 tasks. Our results reveal that the axioms can accurately assess the progress of operators' learning."

Nonetheless, the conventional asphalt compaction OSSs tend to cognitively overload operators with information that requires much human interpretation on the fly. To address the problem of OSSs' infobesity, the transition to a higher level of system automation that prescribes actions, i.e., prescriptive guidance, can be considered. To this end, this research aims to develop a novel compaction trajectory planning method that can be used to implement the Prescriptive Guidance mode in asphalt compaction OSSs. The proposed method analyzes the compaction and temperature profiles of the asphalt in real-time and suggests a compaction trajectory that ensures compaction efficiency and continuity. The proposed method is developed and compared to other types of asphalt compaction OSSs in two case studies. It is shown that while prescriptive asphalt compaction OSSs have a clear edge over more conventional OSSs in terms of improving compaction efficiency (i.e., more than 50% increase in compaction efficiency), there are still technology adoption and cultural issues that may affect the acceptance of this new technology in practice. The main contribution of this research is that it generates insights into (1) how to develop actionable and prescriptive compaction guidance, and (2) the interplay between the experience level of machine operators and the effectiveness of different support modes of asphalt compaction OSSs."

The increase in product variability directly impacts the complexity of the manufacturing process and consequently increases the possibility for human-generated error. Several solutions have been offered to reduce the potential risk of error in complex assembly processes which can be generalized as cognitive-based or physical-based assistive methods. Creating a digital twin of the process, both the human and machine elements, is a preliminary requirement before deploying such solutions in a real-world manufacturing environment. The digital twin simulation provides a platform for testing a variety of solutions and what-if scenarios to improve planning and decision making. While there exist commercially available products of human digital twin modeling, these do not provide a proper platform for human – machine interaction modeling. In the context of this work, machine is defined as an industrial robot with an objective of investigating the feasibility of deploying a smart collaborative robotic solution to provide physical assistance to the human worker in a cumbersome manufacturing process. To do so, an overhead assembly operation from a real-world vehicle assembly plant is identified, and a digital twin of human model is created in Siemens Tecnomatix suite. The study starts with the simulation of various human anthropomorphic models to discover the limitations in performing the assembly tasks based on gender, weight and height. Furthermore, a digital twin of a mobile robot designed to provide physical assistance to the human to perform the assembly operation is introduced. The results are evaluated in terms of process time, joint ergonomic impact and reveal some current limitations of combined digital twin modeling of humans and robots collaborating."

Therefore, assembly assistance systems are increasingly used to manage complexity in terms of guiding workers through assembly processes. Previous research work in this context has mainly focused on the assessment and improvement of typical assistance functions as well as their implementation. The integration of active knowledge management on both shopfloor and planning level illustrates a high potential for the extension and development of new assistance functions. However, the possibility of using informational assistance systems to implement active knowledge management in industrial assembly has not been sufficiently studied yet. Therefore, this paper firstly defines the main challenges of the integration, which are summarized in a negative cycle of knowledge management in assembly, and secondly describes the key requirements for knowledge management in conjunction with assembly assistance systems. Using these requirements, the paper finally presents a conceptual framework and the implementation in an informational assembly assistance system."

However, traditional training programs, structured in pre-established sessions and relying on real equipment with expert technicians working alongside learners, are limited in their ability to establish a connection with the moment of effective performance and maintain effectiveness, which may diminish over time due to the forgetting phenomenon if conducted well in advance. Recognizing the pivotal roles of experience and training in mitigating human errors during maintenance tasks, as well as the limitations in current training practices, this study aims to propose a novel prescriptive training model and discuss practical managerial implications. This model leverages prescriptive analytics and cognitive-based learning models with the aim of generating training sessions tailored to the specific needs of maintenance tasks and calibrated to the operator’s expertise level. The ultimate goal is to develop the basic model for an adaptive training system, utilizing advanced technologies to enhance the performance of workers and reduce the risk of errors in non-routine tasks."

Optimization of assembly and training of staff requires a series of demo installations and excessive use of costly operational resources. In some cases, components are located at different sites, making the orchestration of the whole system even more difficult. Virtual Reality (VR) collaboration environments offer a solution by enabling high fidelity testing and training of complex manufacturing systems. On the other hand, such platforms are difficult to implement in an engineering perspective, as they are required to provide reliable, standard interfaces towards both robotic components and human operators. The VirCA (Virtual Collaboration Arena) platform is a software framework that supports various means of collaboration through the use of 3D augmented/virtual reality as a communication medium. VirCA offers functions for the high-level interoperability of heterogeneous components in a wide range of domains, spanning from research & development, through remote education to orchestration and management of industrial processes in manufacturing applications. This paper provides an overview of the industrial requirements behind high-fidelity virtual collaboration and demonstrates how the VirCA platform meets these requirements.

Existing strategies, including safety zoning are sub-optimal since they seldom fully exploit the capabilities of the collaborative robot (for repetitive tasks) and highly cognitive tasks (best suited for the operator). The recently released ISO 15066 standard for collaborative robots proposes varying safeguards, including force, speed and distance limiting functions. The latter is particularly attractive as it allows the robotic agent to adapt its operating behaviour in proximity of the operator and in instances likely to lead to safety hazards. This paper discusses strategies explored for implementing dynamic zoning in shared workspaces, considering the input speed/force of the robot as dependent on the distance between human and robot. Two main strategies were modelled, for implementing zoning. The first strategy explored integrating a LiDAR sensor, and utilising LiDAR data to dynamically map the separation distances between the operator and robotic agent. The second strategy explores an experimental setup utilising the Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor for capturing 3D point clouds, and in turn, detecting objects/agents and the proximity distance. In both instances, objects/agents were detected up to a separation distance threshold, considering error sensitivity below values of 0.1 meters. Both use cases were demonstrated using a Yumi robot and form the basis of future work towards dynamic workspace zoning."

Human workers, due to their unique blend of cognitive and motor skills, thus flexibility, are indispensable and will continue to play a pivotal role. Because of their unique experiences and attributes, they inherently exhibit variability in their processing times and learning rates, which complicates frequent production ramp-ups. Recognizing the lack of comprehensive models that simultaneously account for stochastic processing times and heterogeneous learning during production ramp-ups, this study aims to bridge this gap. We developed an analytical model of a two-worker production system with an intermediate buffer by focusing on worker learning curves, stochastic processing times, and learning heterogeneity. Through an illustrative case, we derived insights into the performance of such systems, specifically in terms of measures including the mean throughput time of a batch, mean waiting time of a part in the buffer, mean idle time of workers, work-in-progress distribution, and buffer usage during the production run. We found that deterministic learning models can significantly underestimate the throughput times, and even consistent average learning rates can lead to variable throughput times based on the learning patterns. Our findings emphasize the need for production managers to consider these factors for realistic and effective production planning, underscoring the novelty of our approach in addressing these intricate dynamics to improve not only system performance, but also worker well-being."

This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATB, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity."

Though some previous studies showed increases in workers' mental load can adversely affect the safety-critical function of workers' situational awareness, limited previous work has utilized machine learning (ML) techniques for mental load classification models with Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals to passively identify at-risk workers suffering excessive mental loads. Within an immersive mixed-reality environment simulating an electrical construction task, this study employed ensemble modeling to classify workers' mental load via their fNIRS-captured brain activation. Beyond identifying the prefrontal and motor cortices as the most important brain areas contributing to ML-driven mental load classifications when using fNIRS, this paper also proposes a mental load classification methodology that synthesizes neuroimaging data with individuals' risk-propensity scores to address the limitations of existing personalized and generalized ML models. The results reveal better performance for fNIRS-based mental load classifications given participants' personal risk propensity (risk-seeker and risk-averse). This research, therefore, (1) offers valuable insights into the importance of identifying at-risk workers who are more likely to experience impaired cognitive processing and situational awareness due to increased mental load, and (2) sheds light on reliable pipelines for developing fNIRS-based mental load classification."

In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making.

Specifically, an end-to-end joint learning strategy is presented to mine the semantic information in tables. The definition and modeling method of the intrinsic relationships between tables with their rows and columns in engineering documents are provided to model the tabular information.

The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry."

In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection."

The aim of these principles is to propose a human-centered approach to design and evaluate systems, processes, and their interactions with humans. Herein, these principles are detailed and applied to Intelligent Manufacturing Systems using Artificial Self-Organizing systems (ASO) as an example.

To solve the above problems, it is necessary to obtain the status and trend changes information and provide information support for the optimization of decision-making and dynamic adjustment of the production system. However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems. In addition, as a formal expression of information processing and knowledge learning process in cognitive informatics, the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model can effectively guide the construction of the production process cognitive mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cognitive framework based on OAR model of the human cognitive world for the dynamic cognitive needs of production system. The framework carries out dynamic cognition from the three dimensions of the manufacturing unit, production situation, and production system, and builds the continuous cognitive abilities from the three dimensions of analysis, decision-making, and learning. By integrating intelligent algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, a computable digital twin model is constructed as a carrier to provide the cognitive enabling technologies and capabilities for the production system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated by the developed computational digital twin platform. The computable digital twin platform provides the production system with important cognitive capabilities such as states perception, trend prediction, optimization decision-making, and knowledge learning, to support the dynamic cognition and optimization decision-making of the production system, and lay a technical foundation for adaptive production and cognitive manufacturing."

Consequently, it can be expected that the importance of industrial robots in production will continuously increase, due to their suitability to take over the role of a universal production machine. However, robots are not yet able to fulfill this role. Industrial use of robots has so far been limited mainly to simple transport and handling tasks in the context of human-robot collaboration as well as highly repetitive automated tasks in the context of manufacturing and assembly. For universal use, robots must be capable to perform more demanding tasks in manufacturing with higher requirements on mechanical stiffness and accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a mechatronic system to couple two robots to a parallel kinematic system to temporarily increase the mechanical stiffness. The coupled state of the robots allows load sharing, higher process forces and eventually higher precision. The overall goal is to enable robots to perform more demanding manufacturing tasks and thus to be utilized in a wider range of applications. Design requirements, the development approach and optimization methods of the first coupling module prototype will be presented and discussed. The next development steps, a future demonstration system and possible use cases for the coupling module will be shown in the outlook."

However, service actions are difficult to predict in front of a traditional CAD model. In this context, digital manufacturing tools and virtual simulation technologies can be validly used to create mixed digital environments where service tasks can be simulated in advance to support product design and improve maintenance actions. Furthermore, the use of human monitoring sensors can be used to detect the stressful conditions and to optimize the human tasks. The paper proposes a mixed reality (MR) set-up where operators are digitalized and monitored to analyse both physical and cognitive ergonomics. It is useful to predict design criticalities and improve the global system design.

This kind of industrial inspection robots is expected to automatically detect anomalous structures (e.g., defects, damages, rejects, etc.) from the images of the manufactured products. Generally, the existing visual anomaly detection (VAD) methods mainly focus on modeling the complex and high-dimensional distribution of normal data, while neglecting the specific visual properties of abnormal data since their frequency of occurrence is much less than that of the normal data. In this paper, inspired by the human cognition on extracting abstractly visual properties and to distinguish the anomaly patterns from the observed data, we propose a novel cognitive VAD method for industrial inspection robot. Specifically, we introduce a constrained latent space to mimic the cognitive ability of humans, where the abstraction learned from the observed normal and anomaly data are represented. We build our method based on a convolutional generative adversarial network and a denoising auto-encoder, where the adversarial learning mechanism is adopted to establish the boundary between the normal and anomaly data. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real-world dataset where the images are captured for the manufactured products. The comprehensive results comparing with several recent VAD methods show that the proposed method is effective to detect the anomaly images of different categories with a high accuracy."

Specifically, the deployment of collaborative robots (cobots) has changed the game in modern smart factories. These robotic agents assist human operators, working with them side-by-side on joint task execution. Because cobots are designed to be more co-workers than tools, fluent interaction between the operators and their robotic counterparts is critical for employees’ task accomplishment and, thus, high performance. The current study investigates the relationships between four perspectives of human–robot interaction fluency (i.e., the human emotions-oriented, the human contribution-oriented, the robot-oriented, and the team-oriented fluency) and operators’ subjective job performance. It also examines the mediating role of work engagement in these relationships. The analysis carried out on 190 male and female cobot operators working on the shop floor showed positive associations between human–robot interaction (HRI) fluency and job performance. The study confirmed the mediating role of work engagement in the relationships of human contribution-oriented fluency and team-oriented fluency with job performance. The obtained results suggest that HRI fluency relates to employee job performance because of the positive affective–cognitive state experienced by the operator when cooperating with a cobot in a coordinated and well-synchronized manner. The findings of the study are discussed within the theoretical framework of cognitive ergonomics, the Job Demand-Control-Support model, the job demands-resources model, and the job design perspective.

Reducing loss incidents in the process industry requires increasingly knowledgeable operators to access multiple sources of current and historic data through industrial informatics. To evaluate the effectiveness of new designs and design features, clear criteria for performance and performance improvements must be developed. The situational design model was developed to assess and develop problem solving skills, the higher cognitive processes necessary for high performing operators to employ in abnormal situations. The situational design model recognizes learner readiness and the disambiguation of “recurrent’ and “non-recurrent” skills. In this paper, the situational design model is demonstrated in a workplace-analogous study to evaluate the effectiveness of Distributed Control System interface adaptation. This type of structured assessment can be used to tie design features more directly to the specific skills of interest and improve the value propositions for new features and designs. The demonstration in this study shows the possibilities for structured assessment and suggests next steps toward aligning business and operations objectives with design evaluation techniques."

This study explores using ocular metrics for tracking changes in physical fatigue during the completion of a repeated handle push/pull task. Participants completed this task over three trials, and pupil size was recorded by means of a head-mounted eye-tracker. Blink frequency was also measured. Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection."

However, the understanding of cognitive processes and actual needs is still somewhat vague. What is needed is a deeper understanding of the nature and scope of needs, to properly identify cases for assistance and select and design appropriate tools. Building on the concept of constraints as applied in Cognitive Work Analysis, we elaborate on this perspective by firstly proposing a general model of human cognition centered around the concept of constraints. A series of qualitative interviews with employees in various sectors is then conducted to test the approach. The results demonstrate that a participative method focusing on needs for assistance can yield relevant results. Based upon the experiences from the study, a taxonomy of assistance for cognitive work is finally proposed. This taxonomy can be embedded in facilitated workshops in order to satisfy identified needs."

Consequently, there is an urgency to opt for automation technologies to upgrade their manufacturing facilities and make them more flexible. Especially this relates to automating manual manufacturing processes, which is often challenging to structure to ensure repetitiveness and generalization to other processes within the facility. Consequently, innovating systematic approaches to identify robotization opportunities is an interesting proposition for manufacturing set-ups that would like to integrate collaborative robots on the shop floor and struggle with the decision steps to follow. In this paper, a framework for supporting robotization effort for manufacturing set-ups is proposed. The methodology consisting of five phases, culminating in the identification of robotization opportunities. A case for manual milling manufacturing processes is demonstrated as a ‘proof-of-concept’. The first step of the proposed approach focuses on task decomposition, in which manual manufacturing tasks are characterized. This is followed by task allocation to a robot and human agent based on intrinsic characteristics of the task to capabilities of the agent. Next, alternative layout configurations for candidate cell layouts are generated. In the final step, a candidate layout is selected and modeled in an agent-based simulation platform, considering factors such as realism, interaction safety between the robot and human agent, and interesting manufacturing metrics such as resource utilization and throughput rate. A final configuration is optimized, which visualizes a collaborative robot performs loading and unloading tasks alongside an operator performing highly cognitive tasks. For safety, zoning of the manufacturing cell is visualized, considering a working area separated by a safety fence."

We combine unique online job postings and patent data to identify AI innovation and AI-skilled labor demand for specific industry sectors and locations. Our analysis shows that AI technologies are increasingly penetrating major industries and disproportionally generating new labor demand for AI-skilled workers in the MSAs in which AI innovation occurs. Our empirical model provides nascent evidence that demand for non-AI labor declines slightly in sectors and MSAs with higher AI skill adoption rates. This decline in labor demand is associated with non-routine cognitive analytical and inter-personal tasks in jobs not previously susceptible to displacement computerization.

Different methods exist for examining ergonomics through a variety of postural evaluation techniques (e.g. Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA)), which are mostly performed through manual survey-based observations. Consequently, measuring ergonomics of operators is time-consuming and happens only sporadically, often after problems occur. Furthermore, as an ergonomist must assign a score to the performed activity, the ergonomics evaluation is subjective. These problems can be resolved by continuous and automated ergonomic load monitoring methods that directly provide feedback to operators. In order to monitor the operator without interfering the task at hand, a vision-based ergonomics monitoring system is developed. Here, ergonomic features (e.g. joint angles) are estimated based on multiple video streams, which are used to calculate an objective ergonomic score using a standard ergonomics evaluation technique. Although cognitive operator support systems (i.e. digital work instructions) for manual assembly environments are widely used, they do typically not include ergonomics information. The goal of the methodology presented in this work is to a) formulate or update digital work instructions, b) provide the operator feedback on its ergonomic soundness via work instructions and c) generate ergonomic risk level reports in an automated way based on the outcomes of the vision-based ergonomics evaluator. Making the ergonomic guidelines context-aware ensures that interventions occur at the right time. The methodology is integrated in a framework for context-aware work instructions and is validated via a proof of concept, based on an actual industrial case. Results show that context-awareness enhances user acceptance and ergonomics of the operator."

Negative correlations were mainly observed between cognitive test accuracy, ECG RRI, ECG RMSSD, ECG HF/LF, fNIRS ALFF, fNIRS functional connectivity (CORRz, COH, PLV), and exposure time. This indicated that increased physical load, stress, and decreased regulation ability to sudden changes, cognitive resource input, and inter-regional brain cooperation were key factors contributing to cognitive impairments over time. A comprehensive performance index (CPI) was established by the weighted sum of accuracy in cognitive tests and physiological features of ECG and fNIRS. The weights suggested fNIRS ALFF, ECG RRI, and fNIRS functional connectivity could be potential biomarkers for cognitive assessment. A set of linear quantitative CPI curves over exposure time was supplied to calculate the thermal tolerance exposure time at various risk tolerances and ambient temperatures. A power-law relationship (R2>0.997) was observed between the thermal tolerance exposure time and the standardized temperature.

Human factor engineering traditionally uses a “percentile-approach” to work-design, preventing an exact adjustment to the ergonomic needs of particular users. New technological advances provide opportunities for major improvements; novel assistance and information systems allow the accommodation of the needs of an increasingly diverse assembly workforce, while minimizing overall physical and mental stress.

Finally, a comprehensive concept, that includes other dimensions of individualization, is presented."

Despite the increasing use of Industry 5.0 technologies in smart product platforming in industrial organizations, a critical issue remains how to assess the providers/suppliers of such technologies in highly competitive markets to fulfil personalized products and services. Following Lancaster's characteristics approach to consumer theory, in this study we contribute to assess digital technologies service providers in the Industry 5.0 era by focusing on both theoretical and empirical evidence inquiring about the convexity of conventional nonparametric frontier estimation methods. To do so, a nonparametric double frontier estimation of the hedonic price characteristics relation is developed from both the buyer's and seller's perspectives. Moreover, a separable directional distance function-based optimization model is developed for the efficiency estimation. Furthermore, a comparable estimation of the convex and nonconvex hedonic price function is proposed. We also explicitly test the impact of convexity in evaluating the efficiency of IoT service providers in the Industry 5.0 context. In this study, we also show that the hypothesis of convexity in assessing the efficiency of IoT service providers is rejected using the Li-test comparing entire densities in the case of the seller's perspective without ratio data. Differences are less pronounced for the buyer's perspective and in the case with ratio data."

Operator support systems are one of the key HSIs that can contribute to reduce human errors. The system proposed in this work, called the concealed intelligent assistant (CIA), is designed as an operator support system using artificial intelligence algorithms. The CIA system validates operator actions and notifies operators of human errors to prevent adverse effects on plant integrity. The operation validation system consists of two-step filtering, namely through a procedural compliance check module and a comparison of safety impact evaluation module. Both modules employ a prediction algorithm with deep neural networks, where the former predicts the results of operators’ decision-making, and the latter implements plant parameter prediction strategies. The CIA system minimizes any increase in the cognitive burden on operators because it provides additional information only when a mistake is actually expected to adversely affect the integrity of the power plant."

It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust."

Teaching a kinematic behavior by demonstration and encoding it with dynamical systems that are robust with respect to perturbations, is proposed in order to address this issue. Given a kinematic behavior encoded by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), this work proposes a passive control scheme for assisting kinesthetic modifications of the learned behavior in task variations. It employs the utilization of penetrable spherical Virtual Fixtures (VFs) around the DMP’s virtual evolution that follows the teacher’s motion. The controller enables the user to haptically ‘inspect’ the spatial properties of the learned behavior in SE(3) and significantly modify it at any required segment, while facilitating the following of already learned segments. A demonstration within the VFs could signify that the kinematic behavior is taught correctly and could lead to autonomous execution, with the DMP generating the newly learned reference commands. The proposed control scheme is theoretically proved to be passive and experimentally validated with a KUKA LWR4+ robot. Results are compared with the case of using a gravity compensated robot agnostic of the previously learned task. It is shown that the time duration of teaching and the user’s cognitive load are reduced."

Furthermore, it becomes possible to incorporate human expertise into the DT ecosystem by adopting an ontological approach. The CDT enhances DT services with advanced reasoning capabilities, leading to a profound semantic enrichment of the data.

AI-based teaming strategies are designed to enable machines to leverage human expertise in making decisions using local communications that make intricate sensor systems and expensive computation unnecessary.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a feasible technique to identify their abnormal states to enhance the reliability of human-cybernetics systems. With the advancement of deep learning in physiological modeling, a model for evaluating operators’ performance driven by electrocardiogram (ECG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was proposed, demonstrating high ecological validity. The model fused a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a graph attention network (GAT) backbone to extract discriminative features from ECG time-frequency spectrums and fNIRS prefrontal cortex (PFC) network respectively with deeper neuroscience domain knowledge, and eventually achieved 0.90 AUC. Results supported that handcrafted features extracted by specialized neuroscience methods can alleviate overfitting. Inspired by the small-world nature of the brain network, the fNIRS PFC network was organized as an undirected graph and embedded by GAT. It is proven to perform better in information aggregation and delivery compared to a simple non-linear transformation. The model provides a potential neuroergonomics application to evaluate the human state in vital human-cybernetics systems under industry 5.0 scenarios."

This process applies not only principles from human-supported by automation but also those on automation-supported by human to improve autonomy between humans and machines and autonomy between people. The main concern of human-systems integration is the consideration of a low number of future users in the design process or of the feedback of a majority of users in the evaluation process. Human-system inclusion considers that the system has to take into account and adapt to all users whatever their social, economic, physical or cognitive state, or disability. The concept of “human in the loop” or of “human touch” is usually limited to the definition of the role of humans and machines. It does not consider dynamic variability of users and systems abilities, and anticipate the feasible development of autonomous machines by reducing progressively human engagement in the control and supervisory loop.

Thus, creating safe workspaces for human operators is crucial for the future of factories where humans and robots collaborate closely in common workspaces. The uncertainty of human behavior and, consequently, of the actual execution of workflows, pose significant challenges to the safety of collaborative applications. This paper extends our earlier work, a formal verification methodology to analyze the safety of collaborative robotics applications (Askarpour et al. 2017) [1], with a rich non-deterministic formal model of operator behaviors that captures the hazardous situations resulting from human errors.

Key mental information is obtained through questionnaires and interviews, forming the basis for establishing a user mental model. High-frequency information words are extracted, experimental samples are designed, and importance rating surveys are conducted. Quantitative analysis methods, including factor analysis and weight calculation, are utilized to analyze the needs of target users. Consequently, a user demand hierarchy model is constructed.

Cognitive function, thermal sensation and comfort, rating of perceived exertion, fatigue, hydration, core temperature and heart rate were assessed throughout a shift, on three separate days over a swing. Working memory and processing efficiency did not differ between seasons (p > 0.05), however counting and recall latencies improved throughout the swing (p < 0.05). Participants reported greater fatigue post-shift compared to pre-shift (p < 0.05). Thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and hydration were significantly elevated in summer compared to winter (p < 0.05). Specifically, workers were significantly/minimally dehydrated in summer/winter (urinary specific gravity = 1.025 ± 0.007/1.018 ± 0.007). Although cognitive function and thermal strain were not impaired in summer compared to winter, it is essential to reinforce worker's knowledge regarding hydration requirements. Additional education and/or incorporating scheduled rest breaks for hydration should be considered to ensure the health and safety of mine workers."

Despite a traditional low innovation pace in PI, in the recent years a strong push at worldwide level towards the dual objective of improving the efficiency of plants and the quality of products, significantly reducing the consumption of electricity and CO2 emissions has taken momentum. Digital Technologies (namely Smart Embedded Systems, IoT, Data, AI and Edge-to-Cloud Technologies) are enabling drivers for a Twin Digital-Green Transition, as well as foundations for human centric, safe, comfortable and inclusive workplaces. Currently, digital sensors in plants produce a large amount of data, which in most cases constitutes just a potential and not a real value for Process Industry, often locked-in in close proprietary systems and seldomly exploited. Digital technologies, with process modelling-simulation via digital twins, can build a bridge between the physical and the virtual worlds, bringing innovation with great efficiency and drastic reduction of waste. In accordance with the guidelines of Industrie 4.0 this work proposes a modular and scalable Reference Architecture, based on open source software, which can be implemented both in brownfield and greenfield scenarios. The ability to distribute processing between the edge, where the data have been created, and the cloud, where the greatest computational resources are available, facilitates the development of integrated digital solutions with cognitive capabilities. The reference architecture is being validated in the three pilot plants, paving the way to the development of integrated planning solutions, with scheduling and control of the plants, optimizing the efficiency and reliability of the supply chain, and balancing energy efficiency."

This stems from the misbalance of priorities appointed during the engineering design process. Selection of technology driven features, such as collaborative robots and IoT devices are often implemented at the expense of other criteria such as environmental sustainability. This observation is investigated on a workstation designed for human-robot collaboration (HRC), but with limited regard to the energy consumption and carbon footprint incurred during its life cycle. Consequently, this research work attempts to understand the consequences of design decisions for HRC safety (physical and cognitive) on environmental sustainability. The impacts of various HRC workstation scenarios (including various safety features and components) are evaluated using environmental metrics while Design for Environmental Sustainability (DfES) is adopted to close the rift between safety and sustainability. This work uses material substitution and dematerialisation to compensate for the negative impacts resulting from smart HRC features, achieving a reduction of 10 % in both energy consumption and carbon footprint when compared to the same workstation not having undergone the DfES exercise. This paves the way for academia and industrial designers seeking to strike a balance between human-centric and environmentally sustainable HRC."

Studies indicate that sub-optimal decisions occur when there is a mismatch between the demands of the process and the human's capability. This mismatch leads to high cognitive workload in human operators, often a precursor for poor performance. Recently, researchers in various safety critical domains (aviation, driving, marine, NPP, etc.) have started to explore the use of physiological measurements from humans to understand their cognitive workload and its effect. In this work, we evaluate the potential of EEG to measure cognitive workload of human operators in chemical process control room. We propose a single dry electrode EEG based methodology for identifying the similarities and mismatch between the operators’ mental model of the process and the actual process behaviour during abnormal situations. Our results reveal that SƟ(ω), the power spectral density of theta (ɵ) waves (frequency range 4–7 Hz) in the EEG signal has the potential to identify such mismatches. Results indicate that SƟ(ω) is positively correlated with workload and hence can be used for assessing the cognitive workload of operators in process industries."

A controlled field study with 80 shift workers was set up, in which the impact of an integrative lighting (IL) scenario was investigated during the morning shift. Two groups were compared: a control group (no change in lighting settings) and a IL-group (exposed to a melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance of 192 lux, i.e., bright light with a high fraction of short-wavelengths). Pre-post measurement of visual comfort, cognitive functioning (D2 task, go-nogo reaction time task) and sleep (MotionWatch8) were performed. The IL-settings ameliorated sleep efficiency and sleep latency during morning shift and enhanced alertness (not inhibition) compared to standard lighting conditions.

The cloud layer generates inference model generation by deep learning training and updates the inference model in the edge layer to make the field’s machine smart.

To pave its way, this work stepwise introduces an industrial knowledge graph (IKG)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for achieving the Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. Firstly, an IKG should be formulated based on the extracted empirical knowledge and recognized patterns in the manufacturing process, by exploiting the massive human-generated and machine-sensed multimodal data. Then, a proposed graph neural network-based embedding algorithm can be performed based on a comprehensive understanding of the established IKG, to achieve semantic-based self-configurable solution searching and task decomposition. Moreover, a MARL-enabled decentralized system is presented to self-optimize the manufacturing process, and to further complement the IKG towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. An illustrative example of multi-robot reaching task is conducted lastly to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. As an explorative study, limitations and future perspectives are also highlighted to attract more open discussions and in-depth research for ever smarter manufacturing."

Consequently, manufacturing companies are being forced to consistently increase flexibility and responsiveness of their production systems in order to accommodate changes of the fluctuating market. Among various forms of production systems, human-centred manufacturing systems can offer such a capability in dealing with product variations and production volumes as human workers can always adapt themselves to perform multiple tasks after a learning process. However, human performance can also be unpredictable and it may alter due to varying psychological and physiological states, which are often overlooked by researchers when designing, implementing or evaluating a manufacturing system. This paper presents a study aiming to address these issues by exploring human factors and their interactions that may affect human performance on human-centred assembly systems. The study was carried out based on a literature review and an industrial survey. Critical system performance indicators, which are affected by human factors, were evaluated and the most significant human factors were identified using the fuzzy extent analysis method. The research findings show that experience is the most significant human factor that affects individual human performance, compared to age and general cognitive abilities in human-centred assembly. By contrast, both human reaction time and job satisfaction have the least effect on human performance. The significance of ageing on human performance was also studied and it was concluded that average assembly time of human workers rises by average 1% per year after the age of 38 years old."

Here, Augmented reality (AR) technology could be used to automate this training and help to promptly provide new operators with the necessary skills to perform specific tasks as required. However, the most effective approach to designing such AR-based assistance systems has not yet been fully explored. Consequently, we address this need by reporting on how to design such guiding systems using well-known design engineering methodologies.

In contrast to “fixed” assignment within a cell, the Manufacturing-Uber approach leverages the connectivity of the IoT environment to allow on-demand “floating” operator assignment across cells. An intelligent assignment engine determines and assigns the operator to achieve best system performance. Results show that Manufacturing-Uber outperforms fixed assignment with respect to reduction in required operators, increased machine up-time and more parts completed."

In this paper, we describe evolving roles of the operators in the factories. There are many ways to enhance the operator’s physical, sensing, and cognitive capabilities. Given case studies are based on the defined Operator 4.0 typology. Types can be used individually or in combination to put humans into the center of technological revolution. We also describe our laboratory case studies developed during the previous research. We have focused on legacy systems, healthcare monitoring platform, the concept of predictive maintenance, and machine to people interaction system based on operator position. These case studies illustrate the possible applications of smart and cognitive solutions for the Operator 4.0.

Nowadays, novice workers are often trained by colleagues or foremen in addition to and alongside their main work. Since time is usually scarce and the procedure can be highly variable, one solution for the companies can be the introduction of digital assistance systems. Hence, the focus of this contribution is the initial learning procedure of the assembly of a new and complex product. Therefore, a user study was conducted in close cooperation with an industrial partner to compare the traditional way of training to the self-paced learning with a digital assistance system. During the execution of the user study, objective data was recorded to allow precise measurements of the individual learning progress. Furthermore, the subjective learning experience was assessed using a customized questionnaire and a standardized task load metric. The evaluation of the study results suggests that learning autonomously with a digital assistance system leads to similar performance curves as learning the process through a personal explanation."

However, to achieve an efficient human–robot collaboration, several challenges need to be tackled. First, a safe interaction must be guaranteed to prevent harming humans having a direct contact with the moving robot.

In such systems, the physical and cyber spaces are generally connected through sensors, networking, and control actions. With the surge in available real-time data, automation and intelligence have become increasingly prevalent. However, full automation and sophisticated intelligence often remain challenging to achieve in real-world CPSs. Currently, many practical tasks in CPSs are best tackled through the integration of human cognitive skills with autonomous systems, highlighting the indispensable role that humans play in these settings. In this study, we present a framework for real-time decision-making and control in complex cyber-physical-human systems. The framework consists of three main modules: intelligent data processing, intelligent decision-making and control, and human-computer interaction. It is designed to provide a practical and implementable framework for supporting real-time decision-making and control in cyber-physical-human system applications. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we build a comprehensive decision support tool to manage several important real-time decision-making and control tasks at a container terminal. The tool is seamlessly integrated into the main operating system of the container terminal and aids decision-makers in making optimal decisions and generating appropriate control actions. The effectiveness of the tool is confirmed by observed improvements in several key operational efficiency indicators at the container terminal."

To more efficiently grow plants, specific treatments according to the plant individual needs should be applied. Experienced human gardeners are very good at treating plants individually. Unfortunately, hiring a crew of gardeners to carry out this task in large greenhouses is not cost effective. In this work we present a cognitive system that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for decision-making with robotics techniques for sensing and acting to autonomously treat plants using a real-robot platform. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to decide the amount of water and nutrients each plant needs according to the history of the plant. Robotic techniques for sensing measure plant attributes (e.g. leaves) from visual information using 3D model representations. These attributes are used by the AI system to make decisions about the treatment to apply.

Next, the holistic manufacturing scene is perceived by visual sensors as a temporal graph. Then, a collaborative mode with similar instructions can be inferred by graph embedding. Lastly, mutual-cognitive decisions are immersed into the Augmented Reality execution loop for intuitive HRC support."

Using a sample from a utility company, Study 2 replicates these results and demonstrates that psychological strain further explains the complex relationship between FIW and safety. Furthermore, in Study 2, the mediation pathways linking FIW with safety behaviors were moderated by employees' commitment to safety. The idea that family life can predict safety in the workplace through interference and distraction is important to the collective effort to protect worker health and critical to effective intervention design."

This study aims to create an ergonomic role allocation framework that optimises the HRC, taking into account task features and human state measurements. The presented framework consists of two main modules: the first provides the HRC task model, exploiting AND/OR Graphs (AOG)s, which we adapted to solve the allocation problem; the second module describes the ergonomic risk assessment during task execution through a risk indicator and updates the AOG-related variables to influence future task allocation. The proposed framework can be combined with any time-varying ergonomic risk indicator that evaluates human cognitive and physical burden. In this work, we tested our framework in an assembly scenario, introducing a risk index named Kinematic Wear. The overall framework has been tested with a multi-subject experiment. The task allocation results and subjective evaluations, measured with questionnaires, show that high-risk actions are correctly recognised and not assigned to humans, reducing fatigue and frustration in collaborative tasks."

We consider the different mechanical, sensing, situational awareness, and decision-making tasks involved in the operation of plants and map them to possible realisations of unmanned and autonomous systems. We discuss the implications of current technology capabilities and future technology development perspectives, the factors influencing the complexity of operation in process plants, and the importance of human-machine collaboration. As part of autonomous system capabilities, we consider adaptation as a key capability and we make a connection to adaptation of model-based solutions. We argue that reaching higher and wider levels of autonomy requires a rethink of the design processes for both the physical plants as well as the way automation, control, and safety solutions are conceptualised."

However, construction tasks requiring dexterity remain a challenge due to the need for precise movements, accurate perception, real-time decision-making, and a comprehensive understanding of the environment. To address these challenges, the introduction of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents a significant shift in robotic capabilities to enhance their alignment with the broader spectrum of construction settings. Rooted in cognitive science, embodied AI emphasizes the integration of an agent’s physical form into its computational intelligence processes. It resembles how humans develop motor skills by interacting with physical world. This paper introduces DEXBOT, an exploratory framework for designing construction robots capable of high dexterity using embodied AI principles that mimics human strategies in complex tasks. The framework outlines six key perspectives for solving high-dexterity tasks with embodied AI: scene understanding, localization and motion planning, position-based control, force-based control, sequence planning, and correction decision-making. By presenting preliminary test cases for each perspective, the paper emphasizes the role of embodied AI in advancing dexterity level of construction robots. The DEXBOT framework is expected to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration of designing capable construction robots in the future."

Analyzing Chinese agricultural job vacancy data enables us to discern precise labor market characteristics, facilitating inferences about employment trends and future skill training needs. Employing text mining and network science, we create a skill network, classifying skills into categories based on their interconnections. Our analysis reveals a certain degree of skill polarization in China's agricultural labor force. Skill combinations elucidate diverse labor market dynamics, with digital and soft skills being highly sought after by agricultural employers due to their complementarity with cognitive skills, enhancing workers' competitiveness. Furthermore, we link two skill diversity metrics from the skill network to labor market outcomes, specifically wages, discovering that wage disparities are prominent in single-skill positions, while roles requiring a range of skills command higher wages compared to specialized positions. In summary, our research provides fresh insights into labor market trends, human capital complexity, and the economic inequalities stemming from agricultural digitization and automation, especially in rural areas."

The type of tool, amount of effort and form of energy required vary depending on the output; however they now enable industry to manufacture goods (with excellent quality and extremely high volume). Industry continues to invest heavily in machines so that people can operate productively. Similarly, researchers continue to pursue automation to increase the Degree of Autonomy (DOA) using Advanced Information Processing (AIP) techniques. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computational Intelligence (CI) and Machine Intelligence (MI) now facilitate automation for numerous achievements. The proposed Visual Landing Framework (VLF) design uses a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to facilitate the development of components, that interoperate, via embedded business logic, to deliver the coordination and cooperation techniques required to automate a higher-level cognitive processing problem. As technology incorporates this ever increasing Level of Automation (LOA), humans remain in charge and are retained to make higher-order decisions. Unlike humans, heuristic and declarative logic systems suffers under these conditions and to need to adapt or make human-like decision to succeed. This paper discusses one possible avenue of enhancing the DOA on a ‘Tier 1’ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by reducing the need for the human to concentrate on a difficult cognitive task. The Machine to Machine (M2M) autonomy component uses an on-board camera, the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithms to translate a fixed ground reference into positional commands. With this increased LOA the platform should be able to generate greater independence and enable more autonomous behaviour within unmanned control systems."

Exemplary, the lead time syndrome (LTS) represents one of these counterproductive actions. While planners aim to improve due date reliability by planned lead time adjustments, the result is often an aggravation of due date reliability. The underlying reason is that human perception and decision-making process can be biased. Despite its potential to improve the logistic performance, the meaning and the effects of cognitive biases on the decision-making processes in production planning and control were out of scope of recent investigations in the field of production logistics. The aim of this research is to create a starting point to close this research gap by the development of a heuristic framework identifying relevant decision making situations, the potentially active cognitive biases and the potential impact on logistics performance; for this, we combine the research streams of production planning and control (PPC), behavioral supply chain management and psychology."

Research attempts have been made to better identify construction hazards on a jobsite by analyzing workers’ physical responses (e.g., stride and balance) or physiological responses (e.g., brain waves and heart rate) collected from the wearable devices. Among them, electroencephalogram (EEG) holds unique potential since it reveals abnormal patterns immediately when a hazard is perceived and recognized. Unfortunately, the unproven capacity of EEG signals for multi-hazard classification is a primary barrier towards ubiquitous hazard identification in real-time on jobsites. This study correlates EEG signal patterns with construction hazard types and develops an EEG classifier based on the experiments conducted in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment. Hazards of different types (e.g., fall and slip/trip) were simulated in a VR environment. EEG signals were collected from subjects who wore both wearable EEG and VR devices during the experimentation. Two types of EEG features (time-domain/frequency-domain features and cognitive features) were extracted for training and testing. A total of eighteen advanced machine learning algorithms were used to develop the EEG classifier. The initial results showed that the LightGBM classifier achieved 70.1% accuracy based on the cognitive feature set for the 7-class classification. To improve the performance, the input data was relabeled, and three strategies were designed and tested. As a result, the combined approach (two-step ensemble classification) achieved 82.3% accuracy. As such, this study not only demonstrates the feasibility of coupling wearable EEG, VR, and machine learning to differentiate jobsite hazards but also provides strategies to improve multi-class classification performance. The research results support ubiquitous hazard identification and thereby contribute to the safety of the construction workplace."

Based on a qualitative approach and interviews with leaders or experts of neurodiversity initiatives, we provide a theoretical framework to analyse the links between the neurodiversity of the workforce and digital transformation at the individual, organisational and industry levels. We identify several ways by which the digital transformation may provide a context favourable to autistic workers. This includes creating new opportunities, valuing their performative abilities, cognitive differences and creativity, removing stereotypes and biases during the recruitment and improving the management of psycho-social risks. Neurodiversity management also contributes to the digital transformation by closing the digital skills shortage, shaping algorithms of artificial intelligence and providing a competitive advantage for innovation. Most importantly, neurodiversity management provides an effective model of inclusion that can mitigate the development of inequalities associated with the digital transformation."

Learning from demonstration is a promising approach that aims to enable robots to acquire from their end users new task knowledge consisting of a sequence of actions, the associated skills, and the context in which the task is executed. Current systems have limited support for integrating semantics and environmental changes. This paper introduces a system combining several modalities as demonstration interfaces, including natural language instruction, visual observation and hand-guiding, which enables the robot to learn a task comprising a goal concept, a plan and basic actions, with consideration for the current environment state. The task thus learned can then be generalized to similar tasks involving different initial and goal states."

In order to explore the latest data on successes and failures, this research focused on certain questions such as is early phase of the software development life cycle better than later phases in predicting software success and avoiding high rework? What human factors contribute to success or failure of a software? What software practices are used by the industry practitioners to achieve high quality of software in their day-to-day work? In order to conduct this empirical analysis a total of 104 practitioners were recruited to determine how human factors, misinterpretation, and miscommunication of requirements and decision-making processes play their roles in software success forecasting. We discussed a potential relationship between forecasting of software success or failure and the development processes. We noticed that experienced participants had more confidence in their practices and responded to the questionnaire in this empirical study, and they were more likely to rate software success forecasting linking to the development processes. Our analysis also shows that cognitive bias is the central human factor that negatively affects forecasting of software success rate. The results of this empirical study also validated that requirements’ misinterpretation and miscommunication were the main causes behind software systems’ failure. It has been seen that reliable, relevant, and trustworthy sources of information help in decision-making to predict software systems’ success in the software industry. This empirical study highlights a need for other software practitioners to avoid such bias while working on software projects. Future investigation can be performed to identify the other human factors that may impact software systems’ success."

In the last few decades, academic and industrial settings employ this type of analysis to set a suitable standard for a system’s safety feasibility, and as a result reduce human-based errors. This research paper analyzes current CWA methods and proposes a five-level quantification model portraying the overall cognitive quality of a mining operation."

The European Union points out that Industry 4.0 focuses more on technical feasibility and implementation and less on human needs. In response, it proposes the human-centered approach of Industry 5.0. Here, the human being should move to the center of the process. In this regard, there is still little research activity in the field of PPC and in the context of Cognitive Biases. Therefore, we want to take a first step towards the human-centered approach with this work. To this end, we conduct a systematic literature review and develop a questionnaire to determine the human-centered maturity level. The results will then be compared with already researched Cognitive Biases."

Digital technologies currently promoted by the Industry 4.0 approach, such as collaborative robots and augmented reality (AR), could assist workers for reducing execution times of this “trial and error” procedure. On the one hand, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can enhance assembly process efficiency, by combining human dexterity and cognitive capabilities with robot repetitiveness and support in heavy load handling; on the other, AR can provide interactive instructions to guide workers during the process. In this regard, the present paper is focused on the development of a novel assembly workstation using HRC and AR to support workers during car panel fitting operations. The system is based on the implementation of an algorithm able to convert the values on panel spacing, which are measured by laser gauge positioned on the collaborative robot, in the instructions for the worker to correctly carry out the panel fitting operation.

Robots and artificial intelligence can now be used to conduct non-standardised tasks (e.g. fruit picking, selective weeding, crop sensing) previously reserved for human workers and at economically feasible costs. As a consequence, automation is no longer restricted to standardized tasks within agricultural production (e.g. ploughing, combine harvesting). In addition, many job roles in agriculture may be augmented but not replaced by robots. Robots in many instances will work collaboratively with humans. This new robotic ecosystem creates complex ethical, legislative and social impacts. A key question, we consider here, is what are the short and mid-term effects of robotised agriculture on sector jobs and employment? The presented work outlines the conditions, constraints, and inherent relationships between labour input and technology input in bio-production, as well as, provides the procedural framework and research design to be followed in order to evaluate the effect of adoption automation and robotics in agriculture."

Relevant knowledge is then extracted from the summaries using an improved qualitative content analysis method to generate a large number of pieces of knowledge. Lastly, the pieces of knowledge are integrated in a systematic way to generate a knowledge graph consisting of nodes and links. As a case study, the proposed method is applied to develop the knowledge base of reactor operators pertaining to severe accidents in nuclear power plants. The results show that the proposed method exhibits advantages over conventional methods, including reduced reliance on expert knowledge and improved traceability of the process.

While a number of models for developing Cybersecurity (CS) training frameworks for industrial personnel or general audience have been proposed, these models often lack consideration for humans aspects of learning (cognitive abilities, learning styles, meta-cognition among others) during development. Additionally, the success of a CS training program highly depends on its ability to engage participants. To develop a CS training framework that is able to motivate participants, we must consider individual-specific factors that can affect the result of training, besides establishing optimal training delivery methods and assessment. For this, in this work we propose a CS training framework based on a revised version of the ADDIE model and more recent research personalised learning theory. The Delphi method was used to both develop and validate our decisions during the development of the training framework model. The results of the decision of the Delphi method have later been compared to recommendations in the literature to create the finalised framework. This work presents two major distinctions from other CS training frameworks models described in the literature. First, the developed model is strongly based in learning theory foundations and takes into consideration differences in learning styles, cognitive abilities and metacognition of individuals, to offer tailored solutions optimized for each group of employees and single individual. Second, the use of the Delphi method and the involvement of experts stakeholders from various sides of academia and industry gave a wide insight into current needs and recommendations for CS training, as well as formal validation for the final development."

The research suggests, that a certain level of customization should be considered in the design of digital assistance systems, which is not necessarily the maximum level."

The specific research context was intelligent vehicles, a common form of automation and AI. Findings showed that anthropomorphism can significantly boost user self-accountability for both successes and failures, while hierarchical status primarily affected accountability for failures. Besides, the positive effects of anthropomorphism on self-accountability and use intention were mediated by cognitive empowerment and social rewards, respectively. This study also found that educational background amplified the impact of anthropomorphism, whereas ethnic differences moderated the effects of hierarchical status on self-accountability. Furthermore, incident experiences were found to positively moderate the relationship between hierarchical status and use intention, which indicates the need for more safety-focused strategies for human-computer interaction (HCI). In general, this study presented a promising strategy for academia and industry in designing human-like interactions to balance self-serving bias and foster self-accountability, which can potentially result in more inclusive and effective HCI experiences."

In industrial settings, the current methods for constructing a human digital twin model rely on motion capture devices that require personnel to wear cumbersome equipment, which goes against the principle of flexible interaction advocated for HRC. Furthermore, the current methods do not model humans and robots in a unified space, which is both unintuitive and inconvenient for perceiving and understanding the overall environment. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a digital twin system for HRC. This system facilitates the construction of a digital twin scene, the mapping from the real space to the virtual space, and the planning and execution of collaborative strategies from the virtual to the real space. Designed explicitly for common workstation settings, a robust human mesh recovery algorithm is introduced to address the challenge of reconstructing occluded human bodies. Additionally, uncertainty estimation is employed to enhance the action recognition algorithm, ensuring a controllable level of risk in the recognition process. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over baseline methods. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the HRC system are validated through a case study involving component assembly."

While outsourcing final assembly closer to key markets has competitive benefits, these companies face new challenges with communication and dissemination of information. Concerning shop-floor operators specifically, these challenges affect the initial training and continuing improvement work instructions in particular. Emerging information and communication technology (ICT) have created new opportunities for supporting operators cognitively. In this paper, an immersive virtual reality (IVR) training environment for LEGO gearbox assembly was developed and tested. IVR technologies offer new opportunities where operators can access training and work instructions in an immersive environment, which could potentially improve and influence the operator performance and emotion. Both objective performance and subjective emotion were measured and the impacts were analyzed. The results were compared with four different operator support approaches and it was seen that IVR technology has the potential of improving operator and that further studies on integration, information, communication design and development of measurement methods are needed before the industry can benefit from the full potential of IVR technology."

Hence, this paper aims to present findings regarding concepts for digitalised assembly instructions to support shop-floor operators in a mixed model final assembly with shorter takt times. A bottom-up mixed-methods approach was applied in an iterative development process, resulting in concepts for short takt time instructions. The findings indicate how to cognitively support operators in two situations. First, work tasks are preferably taught beforehand, with educational instructions. Second, operators should be supported with simplified instructions, presenting key elements and deviations in real-time. Conclusively, these concepts will increase the likelihood of the instruction to be used by operators, which enables standardised work and contributes to enhanced product quality."

Operators are still required to “supervise the (system) supervisor” and intervene when variables exceed pre-programmed parameters to avert major incidents. Research in human-computer interaction and advanced process control has often focused on data-driven methods for fault detection as distinct from operator effectiveness. In this paper, we explore the application of a novel data-driven fault-detection technique to enhance operator decision support. During a simulated abnormal event, three users attempted to diagnose the root cause of a process upset using a traditional or standard interface, then with the addition of causal maps, in a A-B-A single-subject design. The causal maps were derived using a hierarchical method that could be applied to a wide range of chemical processes as an online, adaptive augmentation for abnormal situation management. Using a think-aloud technique, the three participants developed high quality insights into the process without negatively impacting the overall task load. These preliminary findings challenge prevailing wisdom in process control interface design, which often focuses on de-cluttering displays at the cost of information resolution."

These robots work alongside humans, increasing their productivity and relieving them of repetitive or strenuous tasks. However, human workers can be reluctant to collaborate with robots owing to certain fears; for example, they may be concerned about job loss, stress, expected effort, or risk to physical integrity. These concerns can negatively impact the acceptance of human–robot collaboration (HRC). As the literature on this topic is fragmented, this study analyzes HRC acceptance in warehouses based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. We identify, classify, and analyze studies examining HRC acceptance in warehouses using a systematic literature review methodology. A framework is established to guide the analysis of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, (perceived) occupational safety, psychosocial, and legal and privacy factors. The results indicate the importance of corporate infrastructure and consideration of cognitive factors in particular. The findings of this study will support future research on HRC in warehouses and provide guidance for managers regarding HRC applicability."

Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution. This paper summarizes the key robotic technologies currently used in offshore oil and gas facilities."

This research explores variations in cybersecurity learning based on gender using the frameworks of self-determination and social cognitive theories. Conducted over two years, the research utilized a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform to facilitate learning and assess outcomes. This study explores the gender disparities in key areas such as intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, conceptual grasp, and performance across five distinct cybersecurity subdomains: web exploitation, cryptography, cyber forensics, binary exploitation, and reverse engineering. The comprehensive evaluation included participant interaction with learning materials, their adeptness in practical exercises, and their achievements in a comprehensive contest covering five essential cross-domain cybersecurity concepts. Pre- and post-study surveys were instrumental in tracking shifts in motivation and self-efficacy levels. Findings pointed to notable gender-based differences in motivational aspects and self-belief following the learning phase, with conceptual understanding and the ability to replicate challenges also varying significantly between genders, highlighting disparities in educational outcomes. Domain-based analysis reveals notable gender differences: male participants excelled in solving reverse engineering and cryptography problems, whereas female participants performed better in cyber forensics and web exploitation challenges. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational strategies in cybersecurity training to bridge the gender gap and foster a more diverse and capable workforce, addressing both the skill shortage and the need for broader representation in the field."

It extends previous work by investigating task- and age-related changes in success rates, latency to success, and solution strategies. Three- to five-year-olds had 10 min to retrieve a toy from either a horizontal or a vertical tube by manufacturing a tool from multiple materials. In the Horizontal Tube Task, success rates were high irrespective of age. Solution strategies revealed mainly second-order innovation (i.e., manipulating materials while retrieving the toy). In the Vertical Tube Task, success rates increased with age and solution strategies reflected mainly first-order innovation (i.e., manufacturing the tool before trying to retrieve the toy). In the Vertical Tube Task, children needed more time to find a solution, with first-order innovation tending to be faster than second-order innovation. These findings demonstrate the potential of young preschoolers to innovate tools when given enough time, but also a high task-dependency of performance."

Using an immersive mixed-reality environment to simulate an electrical construction task, this paper applied a promising neuroimaging approach (functional near-infrared spectroscopy- fNIRS) to study changes in individuals' cognitive responses and decision dynamics under normal and stressful conditions. The results showed that workers failed to process surrounding information due to limited cognitive resources, and misperceived potential risks under time pressure and increased mental demand. These cognitive failures then led to increased overreliance on safety protections and at-risk decisions, and decreased safety performance.

With time easy resources of the fossil fuels are shrinking and newly searched reservoirs, to feed supply demands of global consumption, are mostly located in extreme environmental conditions such as hot deserts, deep water and arctic zone etc. Production of the fossil fuels, in such inhospitable environmental conditions, poses difficult challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE). Tragic incidents like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills are examples of such challenges. Therefore, oil and gas industry has lot to learn from successful implementation of robotics and automation for dull, dirty and dangerous (3D) tasks of manufacturing industry. Most of the robotics technologies, currently used in the oil and gas industry, are mainly focused on inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) of plant facilities with higher frequency and accuracy. Fundamental idea, involved in the automatization of these processes, is based on the principle of teleoperation with skilled operator. Automation of 3D tasks not only improves HSE standards but also lead to much needed economic efficiency by reducing production cycle, floor space and number of staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the risks involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots, first without achieving very high reliability, is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots, where actions are performed by robots but cognitive decisions are still taken by skilled operator, is an excellent choice for this industry as a near future solution. In the onshore oil and gas industry robotic solutions are used both in upstream and downstream processes, such as site survey, drilling, production and transportation, mainly focused in the form of in-pipe inspection robots (IPIRs), tank inspection robots (TIRs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) etc. This paper presents the state of art robotic solutions currently used in onshore oil and gas facilities."

Nonetheless, there exists no unanimous consensus among researchers regarding whether organizational AI adoption has a favorable or unfavorable impact on employees' career development. Building upon social cognitive theory, we explores the underlying mechanism through which organizational AI adoption influences employees' proactive career behavior. A three-wave time-lagged survey involving 348 employees from three hotels and five advanced manufacturing enterprises in Chengdu, China, was conducted. The findings revealed that organizational AI adoption led to a reduction in employees' self-perceived employability. The prominence of an employee's future work self-salience was found to be a determining factor in how their self-perceived employability influenced proactive career behaviors. Specifically, this impact manifested negative for employees exhibiting high levels of future work self-salience, while it appears positive for those with low levels. Finally, this study confirmed the moderating role of future work self-salience in the indirect impact of organizational AI adoption on proactive career behavior through self-perceived employability. Our study underscores the significance of considering individual characteristics, such as future work self-salience, in analyzing how organizational AI adoption affects employees' career-related behaviors."

As one of the crucial supporting technologies for industrial equipment health management, bearing health analysis has increasingly become an important research field that is promising to improve the reliability and efficiency of modern industrial systems. One of the main challenges in condition-based maintenance and management of bearing is the health quantitative modeling and assessment. Therefore, a learning-based health modeling method, on the basis of newly defined multidimensional frequency-domain health feature, is proposed to realize quantitative assessment of bearing health state. First, a multilayer neural network with a special structure is designed. Then, a novel algorithm, namely PAirwiSe CompArison Learning (PASCAL) is proposed for network parameters learning. In addition, experiments are designed and carried out on a real industrial bearing testing dataset to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed health modeling method. Experimental results are compared with those of two others recent research works, and the performance is measured with a percentage error metric."

The manufacturers are presently facing difficulties with the process of Augmented reality (AR) instruction creation for the required product assembly system. The existing AR instruction development process demands highly skilled experts and more time consumption. Hence, the manufacturers are presently relying on third parties to acquire the required AR instructions by providing the necessary assembly particulars as input. Where, the cost of developing AR instruction is another big challenging concern. Predominantly, the significance of providing exact assembly input is vital for the experts to develop the appropriate AR content without any errors. An automated approach is developed in this study to resolve the difficulties with assembly sequence input for the AR instructions development process. The automated approach affords four different provisions that include validation of an assembly sequence input prior to the AR instructions development stage, suggestions for assembly sequence input generation, simulation of validated assembly sequence in the Virtual reality (VR) environment for user perception, and generation of virtual content for AR visualizations. Subsequently, the generated digital contents from the automated approach are imparted into the AR Unity platform to develop the required AR instructions for the product assembly system. Notably, this study explores the AR customized marker technique to visualize the AR content in the user’s view of the physical context. Finally, the AR guidelines are built as apps for the selected 11-part assembly and deployed on the shop floor for the user to perceive the AR content through visualization devices for execution of assembly operations in a real-time context. In addition, the effectiveness of the automated approach is analyzed with the existing approach, and the consequences are explored through the process of receiving feedback from the experts about the error rate, cognitive level, and creation time."

In this paper, an objective parameters-based theoretical model is proposed to estimate the information-based processing time of a motor and cognitive task. The evaluation of the information-based processing time is based on two physiological parameters: Oxygen Consumption and Heart Rate. The effectiveness of the model on both cognitive and motor case study is tested. The results achieved shown that the individual respiratory capacity significantly affects the evaluation of the information-based processing time. More generally, a higher respiratory capacity allows to minimize the information-based processing time, improving the individual’s performance."

However, the effect is difficult to quantify, especially for jobs that are near hyperthermal radiant sources. In this study, ten young male subjects were directly exposed to five different radiation panel temperatures for 60 min, i.e., 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 °C, at 0.8 m from the radiant panel. Subjects were asked to perform cognitive tasks and subjective questionnaires and monitor 16 channels of EEG signals in a chamber. Based on the assessment of the EEG characteristics, the impacts of Local Strong Thermal Radiant on cognitive abilities and EEG are investigated. The results indicated that cognitive abilities were improved while the radiant temperature was below 250 °C. As the radiation temperature increases, the normalized power of β activity and α activity increases, and the vigilance and frontal EEG asymmetry increase. When it reaches 300 °C, all these features decrease and show an inverted “U” shape. The Local Strong Thermal Radiant arouses β activity and motivation for a short period and enhances cognitive abilities. The thermal comfort scores and thermal sensation scores rise with increasing temperature. Several international standards and literature can verify the findings of this study. This study's findings provided a foundation for assessing the cognitive abilities and inducing the mental states of hyperthermal radiant environment young workers to advance effective safety management in the industrial workshop."

The key to a successful teleoperation robot system is the delicate design of the human-robot interface that helps strengthen the human operator’s situational awareness. Traditional human-robot interface for robotic teleoperation is usually based on imagery data (e.g., video streaming), causing the limited field of view (FOV) and increased cognitive burden for processing additional spatial information. As a result, 3D scene reconstruction methods based on point cloud models captured by scanning technologies (e.g., depth camera and LiDAR) have been explored to provide immersive and intuitive feedback to the human operator. Despite the added benefits of applying reconstructed 3D scenes in telerobotic systems, challenges still present. Most 3D reconstruction methods utilize raw point cloud data due to the difficulty of real-time model rendering. The significant size of point cloud data makes the processing and transfer between robots and human operators difficult and slow. In addition, most reconstructed point cloud models do not contain physical properties such as weight and colliders. A more enriched control mechanism based on physics engine simulations is impossible. This paper presents an intelligent robot teleoperation interface that collects, processes, transfers, and reconstructs the immersive scene model of the workspace in Virtual Reality (VR) and enables intuitive robot controls accordingly. The proposed system, Telerobotic Operation based on Auto-reconstructed Remote Scene (TOARS), utilizes a deep learning algorithm to automatically detect objects in the captured scene, along with their physical properties, based on the point cloud data. The processed information is then transferred to the game engine where rendered virtual objects replace the original point cloud models in the VR environment. TOARS is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of 3D scene reconstruction and situational awareness of human operators in robotic teleoperation."

Traditionally, human reliability is accounted for by using Human Error Probabilities, which emphasizes inevitability. In this work, we demonstrate that eye tracking serves as a reliable sensor of various cognitive tasks performed by the operator while managing process abnormalities. Experimental studies conducted on 11 participants reveal characteristic fixation patterns that contain information about their cognitive ability to orient, diagnose and execute recovery actions during abnormal situations. These results hold promise for predicting incipient cognitive failures which in turn would enable proactive measures to prevent human error."

The experiment used existing interruption coordination methods as a basis, and the results showed a difference in the effect of interruptions and interruption coordination between cognitively complex laboratory tasks and manual assembly tasks in an authentic environment. Most notably, the negative effects of interruptions delivered without consideration were smaller in this experiment. Based on these findings, recommendations were developed for designing interruption systems for minimizing the costs (errors and time) imposed by interruptions during assembly tasks in manufacturing."

The speed at which they learn directly contributes to the success of their firms in competitive markets. Learning curve research has been either on the individual or organizational level. A few papers have developed learning curve models for a group of workers, even fewer that used empirical data for that purpose. However, none of the existing models comprises measurable elements from real industrial tasks. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by proposing a bivariate group learning curve model, an aggregation of three learning curves where the number of workers in a group, and the number of repetitions are the independent variables. The dependent variable is the unit assembly time. The three learning curves represent motor, cognitive, and waste per unit assembled. The aggregated learning curve was fitted to experimental data consisting of different group sizes (1 to 4 students/workers), each performing four repetitions, and later compared to two log-linear learning curves, with and without plateauing. The results showed that the aggregated model represented the data the best and that segmenting waste into sub-elements (job familiarization, errors, and group coordination) improved the performance of the model. The parameter values affected by group sizes and repetitions for each task element provided insights that managers could use to improve the performance of their workforce."

The framework allows operators to control the robot via both End-Effector (EE) and joint movements and to transfer compound shapes accurately to the robot. Seventeen hand gestures, which cover the position and orientation controls of the robotic EE and other auxiliary operations, are designed according to cognitive psychology. Gestures are classified by a deep neural network, which is pre-trained for two-hand pose estimation and fine-tuned on a custom dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 99%. The index finger’s pointing direction and the hand’s orientation are extracted via 3D hand pose estimation to indicate the robotic EE’s moving direction and orientation, respectively. The number of stretched fingers is detected via two-hand pose estimation to represent decimal digits for selecting robot joints and inputting numbers. Finally, we integrate these three manners seamlessly to form a programming framework. We conducted two interaction experiments. The reaction time of the proposed hand gestures in indicating randomly given instructions is significantly less than that of other gesture sets, such as American Sign Language (ASL). The accuracy of our method in compound shape reconstruction is much better than that of hand movement trajectory-based methods, and the operating time is comparable with that of teach pendants."

The findings show that (1) a rise in the proportion of automated machines to general capital inputs increases the wage gap of labor complementary to automated machine capital and general capital, and a rise in the proportion of demand for both types of labor complementary to automated machines and general capital is an influential mechanism; (2) the productivity-enhancing effect suppresses the widening of the wage gap between the two types of labor; and (3) the results of heterogeneity analysis show that an increase in automated machine inputs among non-state-owned manufacturing firms and technology-intensive firms widens the labor wage gap.

Construction equipment operators’ hazard perception error (HPE) has been recognized as one of the primary reasons for these accidents. Operators’ hazard perception involves a series of cognitive functions that will change as the construction process evolves. Although the importance of hazard perception to construction equipment operating safety is widely recognized, the analysis and interpretation of its cognitive processes, potential cognitive failure modes, underlying causes, and dynamic characteristics involved has not been fully addressed. Furthermore, there is still a lack of an effective method to quantitatively assess HPE evolution and changes in corresponding cognitive states over time. This study combines a cognitive model and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) modeling to provide a qualitative and quantitative proactive analysis of operators’ HPE. Considering the lack of prior knowledge of operators’ HPE in the construction industry, computational models of several key cognitive functions and multiple information sources were integrated to determine the conditional probability distributions of the DBN nodes. The method's feasibility was validated with a case study. Researchers and practitioners may customize the model to quantify the occurrence tendency of operators’ HPE under a specific construction condition to assist in proposing countermeasures to reduce and mitigate HPE."

Furthermore, it presents examples of technology enablers for placing the human in the loop at selected application cases relevant to production environments. Such placement benefits from the joint management of linked maintenance data and knowledge, expands the power of machine learning for asset awareness with embedded event detection, and facilitates IoT-driven analytics for product lifecycle management."

In case the main fire pump becomes ineffective during a fire, the emergency fire pump is used to extinguish the fire. In this case, it is necessary for the ship's crew to operate and use the pump without any failure. The aim of this study is to systematically predict human (crew) reliability for emergency fire pump operational processes on tanker ships since human dependability plays a significant role in safer shipment. To achieve this goal, fuzzy and BN (Bayesian Network) CREAM (Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method) modelling is applied. CREAM is used to methodically estimate the probability of human error within a fuzzy set that accounts for uncertainties of CPC (Common Performance Condition), while BN is competent in estimating control modes in CREAM's reliability analysis. The paper's findings show ship crew reliability (9.08E-01) for the emergency fire pump operation process on tanker ships.

To address this, tailored carbon-zero feedback algorithms are proposed to complement human judgment in agile workflows. Specifically, prescriptive analytics, federated learning, and probabilistic programming are injected into Scrum, Kanban, and Lean respectively to restore clarity amidst ambiguity.

Every person falls somewhere within the spectrum of learners. As per educational psychology, there are 3 types of learner groups namely; visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners. This concept focuses primarily on kinesthetic learning and its link to other forms of perception. According to the Cambridge dictionary, kinesthesia is ‘the ability to know where the parts of your body are and how they are moving’. Kinesthetic learning links the movement of the body with learning of different skills and acquiring knowledge. Among somatosensory sub-modalities, this product aims to incorporate tactile perceptions namely, touch and temperature into the development of the playable toy. Using different patterns, engravings, and fidget movements, this product aims to improve the field of education. TRIZ method of ideation and conceptualisation is used and a variety of different forms and functions are discussed. Primary research was conducted with 20 people to analyse the impact of certain tactile perceptions on mental cognitive processing. The study was done with several patterned discs and was then tracked using bio-monitoring and questionnaires. The results showed specific patterns to have increased cognitive functioning and awareness. Based on these results, further study was conducted with memory and skill-based tests. It was conducted while the subject used the discs. These concepts include the development of a line of various educational toys that serve as an advancement in the education industry. It aims to create further prototypes for testing. In essence, this study hopes to design and develop a product for learners of all ages to help them learn and retain knowledge faster."

The former are materialised using audio and visual cognitive aids, which the user receives as dynamic stimuli in real time during collaboration, and are aimed at information enrichment of the latter. Adaptive techniques investigated refer to the robot; according to the first one of them the robot decelerates when a forthcoming contact with the user is traced, whilst according to the second one the robot retracts and moves to the final destination via a modified, safe trajectory, so as to avoid the human. The effectiveness as well as the activation criteria of the above techniques are investigated in order to avoid possible pointless or premature activation. Such investigation was implemented in a prototype highly interactive and immersive Virtual Environment (VE), in the framework of H-R collaborative hand lay-up process of carbon fabric in an industrial workcell. User tests were conducted, in which both subjective metrics of user satisfaction and performance metrics of the collaboration (task completion duration, robot mean velocity, number of detected human-robot collisions etc.) After statistical processing, results do verify the effectiveness of safe collaboration techniques as well as their acceptability by the user, showing that collaboration performance is affected to a different extent."

Previous study revealed that polysorbate 80 (P80) as a widely used emulsifier in food industries and pharmaceutical formulations could directly alter the human gut microbiota compositions. However, whether long-term exposure to P80 could accelerate age-related cognitive decline via gut-brain axis is still unknown. Accordingly, in this study, we used the senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse model to investigate the effects of the emulsifier P80 intake (1 % P80 in drinking water for 12 weeks) on gut microbiota and cognitive function. Our results indicated that P80 intake significantly exacerbated cognitive decline in SAMP8 mice, along with increased brain pathological proteins deposition, disruption of the blood–brain barrier and activation of microglia and neurotoxic astrocytes. Besides, P80 intake could also induce gut microbiota dysbiosis, especially the increased abundance of secondary bile acids producing bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Clostridium scindens. Moreover, fecal microbiota transplantation from P80 mice into 16-week-old SAMP8 mice could also exacerbated cognitive decline, microglia activation and intestinal barrier impairment. Intriguingly, the alterations of gut microbial composition significantly affected bile acid metabolism profiles after P80 exposure, with markedly elevated levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA) in serum and brain tissue. Mechanically, DCA could activate microglial and promote senescence-associated secretory phenotype production through adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) importing lysosomal cholesterol. Altogether, the emulsifier P80 accelerated cognitive decline of aging mice by inducing gut dysbiosis, bile acid metabolism alteration, intestinal barrier and blood brain barrier disruption as well as neuroinflammation. This study provides strong evidence that dietary-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis may be a risk factor for age-related cognitive decline."

Physical and cognitive fatigue can be exacerbated by prolonged physical and cognitive workload. As such, we propose that the identification and mitigation of fatigue factors could reduce the risk of incident and injury in hazardous work environments. This paper introduces a semantic model for workload categorization. The model takes as input, a set of multi-modal physiological measurements, and uses parallel processing, complex event processing, and rule-based modelling to categorize a series of workloads (resting, cognitive workload, and physical workload). The model has undergone a set of evaluations, including categorization accuracy, and performance. The model has been tested under three scenarios: when a participant is resting and refraining from any physically or mentally demanding tasks; when a participant is undertaking a cognitively intensive task; and when a participant is walking, jogging, and running. The study has been conducted with participants between the ages of 22 and 39 and has shown an average accuracy of 89% for resting workload, 76% for cognitive workload, and 97% for physical workload. Finally, in this paper we discuss the application and extension of this model to predict fatigue in hazardous industries.

However, existing models for prioritizing risk in Fine-Kinney fail to account for the interconnectedness of experts’ cognitive information in interval-valued spherical fuzzy situations. This paper creates a new fuzzy compromise ranking of alternatives from distance to ideal solution (CRADIS) method to address the limitations of the Fine-Kinney model in occupational risk analysis. The interval-valued spherical fuzzy numbers are extended into the conventional risk scales in the Fine-Kinney model to generate a processing method for uncertain risk rating data. Then, the weighted averaging operator is developed based on the Choquet integral and interval-valued spherical fuzzy sets to construct the collective risk assessment matrix. This developed operator can capture inter-dependencies among risk data. Next, an enhanced CRADIS method with interval-valued spherical fuzzy sets and entropy measures is presented to address the risk ranking issue in the application of Fine-Kinney. To demonstrate the implementation of the synthesized occupational risk framework, a case study analyzing the occupational hazards in the metro construction process uses numerical methods. The proposed framework undergoes parameter sensitivity analysis to test its rationality. An evaluation compares the enhanced framework with the risk-prioritizing methods used in F–K to assess its advantages. The outcome suggests that the framework offers an appropriate and dependable approach to prioritizing occupational risks in a subjective and ambiguous scenario."

Against this background, the question arises as to how human-centred work design has to be in the digital age. In order to derive indications for work design, first it is necessary to find out which work conditions actually are present for different tasks and what their level of digitization is. This article focuses on the working conditions and the level of digitization of object-related tasks. These tasks are characterized by the fact that objects are processed or handled. In particular, it includes the task groups manufacturing, transporting and cleaning. For these three groups, current working conditions of N = 6.435 employees with object-related tasks were analyzed based on the BIBB/BAuA Employment Survey. Furthermore, the current state of digitization of N = 411 employees with object-related tasks was analyzed based on the survey Digitization and Change in Employment (DiWaBe). The results show, that a high proportion of physical work requirements and physical-chemical environmental conditions have an impact on object-related tasks. Furthermore, the results indicate tendencies towards monotonous work processes. Object-related tasks show a rather low degree of digitization. However, especially in manufacturing and transport, detailed instructions are often given by means of various technologies. Based on the data analysis, a structured literature analysis was conducted about the current state of research on new technologies in object-related tasks. It was found, that research and practice is concerned with technologies that meet the high physical demands of object-related tasks in particular (e.g. HRC, exoskeletons). In addition, there are many approaches to support employees cognitively with digital assistance systems. This article present the results of the data and literature analysis."

However, most previous research on wearable AR technology did not effectively supported situation-aware task assistance because of AR marker-based static visualization and registration. In this study, a smart and user-centric task assistance method is proposed, which combines deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to provide more effective visual guidance with less cognitive load. In particular, instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN and markerless AR are combined to overlay the 3D spatial mapping of an actual object onto its surrounding real environment. In addition, 3D spatial information with instance segmentation is used to provide 3D task guidance and navigation, which helps the user to more easily identify and understand physical objects while moving around in the physical environment. Furthermore, 2.5D or 3D replicas support the 3D annotation and collaboration between different workers without predefined 3D models. Therefore, the user can perform more realistic manufacturing tasks in dynamic environments. To verify the usability and usefulness of the proposed method, we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses by conducting two user studies: 1) matching a virtual object to a real object in a real environment, and 2) performing a realistic task, that is, the maintenance and inspection of a 3D printer. We also implemented several viable applications supporting task assistance using the proposed deep learning-based task assistance in wearable AR."

Accurate mental models, i.e., a correct understanding of the process and its causal linkages, are prerequisites for safe operation. Mental models are often defined and explained in abstract terms that make their interpretation subjective and prone to bias. In this work, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based formalism to characterize control room operators' mental models while handling abnormal situations. We show that a suitable HMM representing the operator's mental model – including the states, state transition probabilities, and emission probability distributions – can be identified experimentally using data of the operator's control actions, eye gaze, and process variable values. This HMM can be used for the quantitative assessment of operators' mental models as illustrated using various case studies. We discuss the potential applications of the model in identifying various cognitive errors and human reliability assessment.

Specifically, by using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a basis of the argument, the research examines how cognitive demands and possibilities for development mediate the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and work engagement. The research predicted that PSC positively increases work engagement via enhancement of positive demands (i.e., cognitive demands) and possibilities for development. The current study utilized a cross-sectional survey approach among 392 employees in one oil and gas organization in Malaysia. To test the research hypotheses, data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM). The study revealed that PSC increased possibilities for development and had no significant relationship with cognitive demands. Furthermore, the results supported the notion that working condition (possibilities for development) mediated the relationship between PSC and work engagement. Overall, these findings suggest that PSC plays a significant role as predictor for working conditions and work outcomes in oil and gas industry. The results may be used to help occupational health and safety practitioners, human resource practitioners and higher management within organizations to understand how PSC influences working conditions and work outcomes."

However, worker fatigue is barely considered in DRCFJSP, which will result in unsuitable task assignments for workers and bring about negative effects such as muscle fatigue and cognitive confusion. To this end, a fatigue-conscious DRCFJSP is proposed in this paper, aiming at simultaneously relieving fatigue and promoting productivity by joint scheduling of machines and workers. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to minimize the maximum worker fatigue and makespan. Furthermore, an enhanced NSGA-II (ENSGA) is developed in this paper to cope with the proposed problem. In the ENSGA, four dispatch rules are designed to generate high-quality solutions at the initialization stage. Two neighborhood structures based on a novel method of defining the critical path are designed to strengthen the ability of local search. Finally, with the comprehensive experiments on extensive test instances and a case study from real-world casting workshop, the effectiveness of proposed ENSGA for solving the fatigue-conscious DRCFJSP is verified, and the significance of the proposed joint scheduling approach is elucidated. This work renders the decision-maker practical and effective scheduling with fatigue-conscious for the machine and worker constrained flexible manufacturing system."

As these changes have been revealed by standardized laboratory tests, it remains unclear how much they affect older persons' performance in industrial workplace tasks. The present study therefore compared young and older participants in a task modeled after a complex, realistic industrial workplace scenario, and additionally assessed motor, cognitive and mental variables that might have an impact on overall task efficiency. 25 participants (13 young, mean age 25 years; 12 older participants, mean age 65 years) sat in front of a panel with multiple displays - indicating the momentary state of a simulated nuclear power plant (i.e., power supply and demand, fuel rod stock, temperature) - and multiple actuators - allowing them to modify that state. Their task was to maximize the plant's momentary earnings, which were displayed as well. Participants could increase the earnings by keeping the difference between power supply and demand as small as possible, and to sufficiently use the fuel rod stocks since they did cost earnings. Operator efficiency was defined as final earnings after 8.7 min of work. Kinematics and dynamics of grasping the actuators were assessed with a motion capture system and force sensors. Workload and strain was assessed with established questionnaires, and cognitive abilities with PC-based tests. We found that operator efficiency dramatically declined in older age (−70%). This decline was not related to differences in grasping kinetics and kinematics, workload, or cognition, but was related to the age-related decay of motivation, suggesting reduced motivation as one explanatory factor. We therefore conclude that performance on a simulated complex industrial workplace task is partially dependent of age and motivation, but is difficult to predict from other motor or mental functions. This conclusion is relevant for the assessment of industrial job skills, and possibly also of driving and household skills."

It is understood that performing tasks at work seeks continuous satisfaction of demands for physical and material security, social and emotional comfort as well as economic and productive stability. Due to the complexity of living systems in the global community, involving increasing environmental changes and limit natural resources, intolerance and social violence, political and economic crises, the demand is presented by investigations of such dimensions on decision making, between designated professional to decide in emergency situations.

However, existing research on performance evaluation of cobots has not yet established a common method for constructing a complete performance evaluation index system. The testing methods lack a design basis and fail to evaluate the performance of cobots through operational tasks in industrial production or daily life from the perspective of test tasks. Furthermore, these methods do not facilitate the fusion of multi-source subjective and objective decision-making information, which includes both the knowledge of experts and fundamental parameters of cobots. To this end, this study proposes a multi-source decision-making information fusion framework for evaluating the TCCs of cobots. This framework includes a construction method for an evaluation index system that fuses subjective and objective elements based on statistics, text clustering, and closed-loop feedback mechanism. It also incorporates TCCs test tasks, and an improved fuzzy analytic network process (IFANP). Additionally, it incorporates a combination weighting method that aims to minimise both subjective and objective weights deviations. This framework effectively integrates the subjective knowledge of experts with the objective fundamental parameters of cobots. It accomplishes local TCCs evaluation from the perspective of test tasks. Additionally, it achieves global TCCs evaluation by combining basic performance evaluation indices and the performance of completing the test tasks. A case by Rethink Sawyer (Sawyer) is presented to demonstrate the application process and viability of the developed framework. The experimental results and calculation examples indicate that the research has the potential to provide a certain theoretical basis and reference to solve the performance testing and evaluation issues for other types of robots in engineering applications."

This paper presents a novel robot signalling solution, the Robot Light Skin (RLS),which is an integrated signalling system that could be used on most articulated robots. Our experiment was conducted to validate this concept in terms of its effect on improving operator's reaction time, hit-rate, awareness and task performance. The results showed that participants reacted faster to the RLS as well as achieved higher hit-rate. An eye tracker was used in the experiment which shows a reduction in diversion away from the manual task when using the RLS. Future study should explore the effect of the RLS concept on large-scale systems and multi-robot systems."

Human error is widely considered to be the major cause for most accidents today. Detailed analysis of various incidents indicates that reduced staffing levels in control rooms and inadequate operator training with complex automation strategies as common reasons for human errors. Therefore, there is a need to develop deeper understanding of human errors as well as strategies to prevent them. However, similar to hardware failures, traditionally human error has been quantified using likelihood approaches; this viewpoint abnegates the role of the cognitive abilities of the operators. Recent studies in other safety critical domains (aviation, health-care) show that operator's level of situation awareness as inferred by eye tracking is a good online indicator of human error. In this work, a novel attempt is made to understand the behavior of the operator in a typical chemical plant control room using the information obtained from eye tracker. Experimental studies conducted on 72 participants reveal that fixation patterns contain signatures about the operators learning and awareness at various situations. Implications of these findings on human error in process plant operations them are discussed."

Cognitive automation is defined as a computerized system that provides relevant information to operators, thereby reducing the cognitive workload; mechanical automation refers to an automated system to reduce the physical workload. The case of a truck-body production line of a truck company was investigated by applying modified DYNAMO++ for the material handling system. Then, a simulation program, AnyLogic 6.9.0 was used to investigate the effect of the cognitive and mechanical automation in the material handling system on manufacturing flexibility. The research results showed that the levels of cognitive and mechanical automation of the material handling system were increased by 52.4% and 48.0%, respectively, which resulted in improving manufacturing flexibility by 14.2% in cycle time, 53.3% in downtime, and 26.3% in the number of tasks.

It takes full advantage of the strength, repeatability and accuracy of robots and the high-level cognition, flexibility and adaptability of humans to achieve an ergonomic working environment with better overall productivity. However, HRC assembly is still in its infancy nowadays. How to ensure the safety and efficiency of HRC assembly while reducing assembly failures caused by human errors is challenging. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a novel human-cyber-physical assembly system (HCPaS) framework, which combines the powerful perception and control capacity of digital twin with the virtual-reality interaction capacity of augmented reality (AR) to achieve a safe and efficient HRC environment. Based on the framework, a deep learning-enabled fusion method of HCPaS is proposed from the perspective of robot-level fusion and part-level fusion. Robot-level fusion perceives the pose of robots with the combination of PointNet and iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, where the status of robots together with their surroundings could be registered into AR environment to improve the human's cognitive ability of complex assembly environment, thus ensuring the safe HRC assembly. Part-level fusion recognizes the type and pose of parts being assembled with a parallel network that takes an extended Pixel-wise Voting Network (PVNet) as the base architecture, on which assembly sequence/process information of the part could be registered into AR environment to provide smart guidance for manual work to avoid human errors. Eventually, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach."

The framework will also assist managers and recruiters in better understanding the role of human capital in their collaborations with universities."

Good indoor air quality is an essential component of a healthy indoor environment and significantly affects human health and well-being. Poor air quality in such environments may cause respiratory disease for millions of pupils around the globe and, in the current pandemic-dominated era, require ever more urgent actions to tackle the burden of its impacts. The poor indoor quality in such environments could result from poor management, operation, maintenance, and cleaning. Pupils are a different segment of the population from adults in many ways, and they are more exposed to the poor indoor environment: They breathe in more air per unit weight and are more sensitive to heat/cold and moisture. Thus, their vulnerability is higher than adults, and poor conditions may affect proper development. However, a healthy learning environment can reduce the absence rate, improves test scores, and enhances pupil/teacher learning/teaching productivity. In this article, we analyzed recent literature on indoor air quality and health in schools, with the primary focus on ventilation, thermal comfort, productivity, and exposure risk. This study conducts a comprehensive review to summarizes the existing knowledge to highlight the latest research and solutions and proposes a roadmap for the future school environment. In conclusion, we summarize the critical limitations of the existing studies, reveal insights for future research directions, and propose a roadmap for further improvements in school air quality. More parameters and specific data should be obtained from in-site measurements to get a more in-depth understanding at contaminant characteristics. Meanwhile, site-specific strategies for different school locations, such as proximity to transportation routes and industrial areas, should be developed to suit the characteristics of schools in different regions. The socio-economic consequences of health and performance effects on children in classrooms should be considered. There is a great need for more comprehensive studies with larger sample sizes to study on environmental health exposure, student performance, and indoor satisfaction. More complex mitigation measures should be evaluated by considering energy efficiency, IAQ and health effects."

Year after year industry and academic surveys show that IS-related incidents persist as a top concern on IS managers' agendas. While past research has addressed technological improvements and planning methodologies as a means of improving the continuity of organizational technologies (IS continuity), the “social” part – that is, the humans and their social and cognitive processes – has largely remained in the background and under researched. This current research seeks to bring to the foreground the implications of the social for IS continuity by developing conceptual foundations of the social dynamics in the IS continuity process. This study proposes a framework of IS continuity process with three phases: (1) preparing for incidents; (2) coping with and mitigating the impact of incidents; and (3) recovering from incidents. Implications of and potential theoretical and conceptual foundations for the social in the IS continuity process are discussed together with their practical implications. Addressing the challenges that pertain to the management of IS continuity requires multidisciplinary approaches that broadly take use of social and cognitive theories on individual and collective levels of analysis."

This often results in an increase in fatigue in the working population. The diversity of the workforce is also increasing, whereas physiological differences based on culture are important to consider. The objective of this study was to identify the differences in the levels of fatigue in the workplace experienced by Asian and Western workers in mentally demanding jobs. Method Eight Asian and eight Western participants completed an observation-based study. Each participant was observed for four hours in their workplace while they were working on highly mentally demanding work-tasks either computer programming or mathematical simulations. To balance the effect of time, half of the participants from each ethnic group were observed in the morning session and the other half in the afternoon session. Perceived fatigue was measured every 30 min using the single dimensional Borg and multidimensional SOFI scales. Workload was measured using NASA-TLX, and as a change in resting heart rate. Result Ethnicity and time interacted to significantly affect the perceived fatigue measured by Borg (F (9,126) = 2.03, p = 0.0412) and SOFI (F(9,126) = 3.28, p = 0.0013) scales. Asian participants reported significantly higher workload measured by NASA-TLX scores (F(1, 14) = 3.68, p = 0.0024) and change in resting heart rate (F(1, 14) = 7.77, p = 0.0145) was measured higher compared to Western participants. Unlike fatigue, no significant interactions were observed between time and ethnicity to affect either NASA-TLX scores or change in resting heart rate. Post-hoc analyses show that the rate of fatigue was higher for Asian participants. Correlations between the dependent variables were significant (p < 0.0001), with a stronger correlation identified for Asian participants. Conclusion As compared to the Western participants, Asian participants reported higher values in all dependent measures, including fatigue in both scales, NASA-TLX scores, and change in resting heart rate. Relevance to industry The significant growth in white-collar as well as mentally demanding jobs requires more cognitive resources, while reducing physical activities. The consequences of the imbalances in the use of body resources have yet to be studied. This study has been designed to investigate the issues of imbalance in the workplace."

In the real world, the assessment of human errors relies heavily on experts’ knowledge and experience. Moreover, there are challenges regarding the human error probability (HEP) estimation because of state evaluation information uncertainty, multiple common performance conditions (CPCs), and the correlations between CPCs. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a new improved cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) by integrating linguistic D numbers and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory-based analytic network process (DANP) method for the quantitative analysis of human errors. First, the linguistic D numbers are utilized to express the uncertain CPC state evaluations and the direct relations between CPCs provided by experts. Second, the DANP method is incorporated into the CREAM to determine the weights of CPCs considering their interdependencies and interactions. Then, a CPC effect index is introduced to quantify the CPCs’ overall effect upon performance reliability and obtain the HEP estimation. Finally, the feasibility and practicality of the proposed CREAM model are demonstrated through a practical case of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cargo loading process. The results show that the new improved CREAM can effectively capture the uncertain state evaluation information, better depict the interdependences between CPCs, and obtain more reasonable HEP estimation in the HRA."

Insights from the Social Exchange Theory (SET) and Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) Framework have been used to assess the role of social capital (SC) as a mediator between HPWS, radical innovation (RI), and incremental innovation (II). By using a simple random sampling technique, 328 responses were received from respondents in Pakistan's banking sector firms. For data analysis, structural equation modeling was applied. The results of the study show that HPWS is a significant driver of II, but not RI, in banking sector firms. Moreover, SC plays the role of mediator in the HPWS-innovation link. Outcomes of the study extend the understanding of the “black-box” (i.e., the transmission mechanism between systems of human resources(HR) practices and innovation). It also contributes to understanding HPWS, SC, II, and RI in the context of Pakistan's banking sector. This study expands on earlier research in the areas of HPWS, SC, and Innovation. It supports the view that internal SC enables RI and II. Prior studies indicated that HPWS drives innovations, yet there has been no clear explanation about the mechanism of this effect. By providing empirical evidence on the mediating role of SC, this study expands on existing literature. Empirical validation of an association between HPWS RI, and II contributes to theory by supporting the tenets of the AMO Framework. Unlike prior research that focused on short-term financial outcomes, this study used RI and II as alternate indicators of organizational performance. Our study expanded the literature into the services sector. Furthermore, we contributed to the methodology by conceptualizing HPWS as a high-order formative construct, resulting in significant model parsimony. Insights from our study are relevant to managers because it shows that HPWS implementation not only helps banks to attract, develop, and retain talent but also facilitates the development of SC, which is critical for enabling the innovation capability of the firm. Top managers need to consider internal SC in the design of HPWS because carefully designed HPWS drives SC. This enables idiosyncratic relationships among members of the organization. Thus, the firm gets a competitive advantage that is harder to be copied by competitors. First, data were collected from a single industry. It will be useful to know the effects of multiple industries in future research. Second, this study did not differentiate between different dimensions of SC, i.e., structural, cognitive, and relational. It will be interesting to see how these dimensions relate to HPWS and innovation in future research."

In order to avoid significant discrepancy between human feedback cognitive mechanisms and traditional open-loop recognition methods, a novel intelligent cognitive model based on a variable granularity simulated feedback mechanism is explored in this paper, where evaluation indexes of cognitive results are established to freely regulate cognitive granularity, and the variable granularity simulated feedback mechanism is constructed to update cognitive features and cognitive rules with different granularities. The proposed cognitive model is applied to improve burning state recognition accuracy. With the initial granularity, a burning state recognition decision information system is developed using extracted flame image features. Random vector functional-linker (RVFL) network ensembles are employed to build the initial burning state recognition rules. By using cognitive errors and granularity transformation rules, a heuristic feedback mechanism is proposed to update the decision information system and recognition rules. The experimental results show that our method is effective and outperforms other open-loop recognition techniques."

The high complexity emerges from the combination of a multitude of factors that have to be considered simultaneously within a decision situation. Hereby the factors examined represent decision situation and human (decision-maker) attributes. To help decision-makers in dealing with highly complex decisions several decision support tools, methods and systems (DSS) have been developed. One main disadvantage of DSS is the little adaptation to and integration of user needs and attributes. This paper aims in providing a multilevel stepwise approach for the management of human and decision situation attribute complexity in order to enable a more effective decision support. The decision support is tailored to adapt to decision makers individually and therefore a higher acceptance and use-rate of DSS can be achieved. The approach was developed using findings from literature research and results from several research projects performed in cooperation with industry partners. The presented procedure represents a main design element of the user-centered DSS currently being developed at the Institute of Product Development."

In European Union, the Seveso Directive explicitly refers to equipment ageing and specific procedures and tools have been developed in some countries to verify the adequacy of ageing management plans. Ageing management requires up-to-date knowledge of damage mechanisms, failure rates, and inspection techniques. Although the energy transition is moving towards innovative and low-impact processes, the issue of equipment ageing remains a concern for the future due to several factors as many existing petroleum industries will be kept operating for years and green fuels will partially use existing plants. The use of digital technologies, such as inspection robots and pervasive sensors, is increasing in order to optimize maintenance costs and extend the useful lifetime of critical equipment. This poses challenges for stakeholders in the establishment, control bodies, and competent authorities, which need to effectively manage knowledge in the face of digital and energy transitions. Ontologies represent a fundamental methodology for organizing and integrating information throughout the equipment life cycle. These are beneficial for activities with high cognitive content such as incident analysis, risk assessment, maintenance management, and inspection planning. This work aims to strengthen an ontology for ageing management by making it able to incorporate emerging digital inspection technologies and damage mechanisms related to green fuels; finally, through the developed web-application, the ontology is available to establishment operators and auditors for the evaluation of the adequacy of ageing management."

Based on a literature review this paper draws on cognitive theory to provide a model for enhancing quality of spatial experiences. The model has three stages: encouraging, enabling, and enclosing. The model asserts that in every enhanced spatial experience the audience gets encouraged at the outset by a variety of strategies such as persuasion, designing for meanings, and including concepts in design. The audience must be then enabled by special means, such as immersive and interactive capabilities of the environment along with its security and safety attributes, to get involved with the spatial experience. Consequently, the experience shifts towards a cognitive level at the enclosing stage, focusing on emotion and engagement. To compose this model, at the very beginning, essential components, dimensions, and elements of experience were identified and defined. Seven selected experts were then informed and asked to decide on the priority of the experience's elements. Finally, selected elements were employed to propose the model for enhancing quality of spatial experiences in the built environment. The proposed model is then followed by an example that clarifies how the film industry could apply the model to enhance the quality of spatial experience in the built environment of a movie theatre."

Previous research has examined psychological, health and social aspects associated with underground spaces but mainly employing relatively mono-disciplinary approaches and methodologies, many times in a non-systematic way. Additionally, research up to now has not employed the modern research tools that cognitive neuroscience, experimental social psychology and epidemiology offer.

The overall aim is to examine and address possible psychological and health-related impacts and to enhance social acceptance of underground workspaces. This project begins a unified, systematic and holistic examination of the interaction of human psychology and health with underground spaces to improve public acceptance of underground work. In this study, we present the key elements of a systematic research program examining the relationship between environmental and architectural characteristics of underground spaces with human behavior, cognition and well-being. Initial findings of the research plan show a multi-faceted set of aspects that can affect underground work, from psychological effects on work performance and creativity, social effects on cooperative and risk taking behaviors, health effects, and engineering parameters such as the aesthetic appearance of the space. Problems can arise from the design of underground workspaces, such as disruption from regular exposure to the outdoor environment. Social beliefs, attitudes and cultural meanings can affect the willingness to work underground. The confined environment that is created can amplify issues that are common to all workplaces, including environmental, emotional and motivational factors."

Although extensive data regarding age-related changes are available in the literature, there is a lack of knowledge on how to prepare for an ageing workforce in many companies. Further, age-related declines are mostly not taken into account in workstation design, hence being a reason for physical overload and sick leave. Thus the identification, assessment, and reduction of physical stress takes on a high priority and is the basis for deriving adequate measures given an ageing population.

This enhanced understanding, in turn, can help emphasize the important factors to improve mine safety. The most commonly used techniques include the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the structural equation model with latent variables (SEM). A critical comparison of the three techniques regarding mine safety is provided. Possible applications of latent variable modeling in mining engineering are explored. In this scope, relevant research papers were reviewed. They suggest that the application of such methods could prove useful in mine accident and safety research. Application of latent variables analysis in cognitive work analysis was proposed to improve the understanding of human-work relationships in mining operations."

However, human factors/ergonomics dictates that in order to make the complex, cognitive work of healthcare delivery safer, health IT must properly support human cognition. This means, for example, that new health IT must reduce, not increase, workload during safety-critical tasks. The present study was the first to quantitatively assess the short- and long-term impact of bar coded medication administration (BCMA) IT on nurses' mental workload as well as on perceived medication safety. One-hundred seventy registered nurses across 3 dissimilar clinical units at an academic, freestanding pediatric hospital in the Midwest US participated in surveys administered before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the hospital implemented BCMA. Nurses rated their external mental workload (interruptions, divided attention, being rushed) and internal mental workload (concentration, mental effort) during medication administration tasks as well as the likelihood of each of three medication safety events: medication administration errors, medication errors on the clinical unit, and clinical unit-level adverse drug events. Clinical unit differences were assessed. Findings generally confirmed the hypothesis that external but not internal mental workload was associated with the perceived likelihood of a medication safety event. Comparisons of mental workload from pre- to post-BCMA revealed statistically significant changes in the critical care unit only. Medication safety appeared to improve over the long term in the hematology/oncology unit only. In the critical care and medical/surgical units, medication safety exhibited short-term improvements that were eliminated over time. Changes in mental workload and medication safety, two classically microergonomic constructs, were deeply embedded in macroergonomic phenomena. These included the fit between the BCMA system and the nature of nursing work, the process of BCMA implementation, and BCMA interactions with concurrent changes occurring in the hospital. Findings raise questions about achieving sustainable performance improvement with health IT as well as the balance between micro- and macroergonomic approaches to studying technology change. Relevance to industry Designers must consider how technology changes cognitive work, including mental workload. Hospitals and other implementers of technology must ensure that new technology fits its users, their tasks, and the context of use, which may entail tailoring implementation, for example, to specific clinical units. Evaluators must look over time to assess both changes in cognitive work and implementation issues. Healthcare practitioners must also recognize that new technology means a complex transformation to an already complex sociotechnical system, which calls for a macroergonomic approach to design and analysis."

Today’s instructions are often text based and are used only when learning the assembly. Due to a high product variety the instruction quality need to be perceptual in order for the operator to make fast and correct decisions. To educate and support personnel making instructions five guidelines that support operators’ cognitive abilities have been developed. The guidelines were tested in three case studies with three different used groups: production technicians, students from higher vocational education and bachelor students. Results indicate that the theory behind the instructions is useful and valuable and that further development and testing is needed. The main thing both technicians and students learnt was to support the active cognitive processes, that instructions should be picture based and be as simple as possible."

This research investigated a strategy for overcoming language barriers associated with performance, comprehension, and training effectiveness. Non-linguistic (e.g., EU's Napo animated trainings) and English language (ENG) versions of EHS training were compared for effectiveness with native English language participants (L1), non-native English language participants (L2), and non-English language participants (L0). In the 1st study, 102 L1 & L2 U.S. employees completed one of the two trainings and were assessed on their reaction to and comprehension of the training. For this study, ENG was more effective and preferred by both language groups and this may be due to the workers' English proficiency and the number of channels of communication provided by the training medium. In the 2nd study, 78 L0 Brazilian and Chinese employees completed trainings and were assessed identically to the 1st study. For these participants, Napo training was more effective and preferred by both groups and this was likely because ENG L0 trainees had no channels for processing the information versus Napo's single channel of information. Interestingly, Brazilians in the ENG group outperformed their Chinese counterparts. Conversely, Chinese in the Napo group outperformed Brazilians in the Napo group. Though these findings are somewhat intuitive, they are extremely important for two reasons: 1) there is remarkable dearth of empirical research regarding the effects of the use of lingua franca for safety training. 2) Even though the idea of using lingua franca for training with L0 workers may seem obvious, there are a large number of international companies that use this for their EHS training. The findings from this study may provide a more effective and affordable method for some of these companies’ safety training needs."

Dynamic concept learning is an approach that can effectively process the acquired massive data and extract valuable information from them. Concept cognitive learning (CCL) is a very active research direction in the field of dynamic concept learning, while partial order formal structure analysis (POFSA) is a concrete and practical model of CCL. However, the existing CCL algorithms in POFSA face some challenges when processing constantly changing data. Therefore, this paper is devoted to explore an incremental CCL algorithm based on three-way object partial order structure diagram (OPOSD) in POFSA with the incorporation of the thoughts of incremental learning. The features of five object categories are considered, and their incremental influences on three-way OPOSD are analyzed and their incremental CCL algorithms in three-way OPOSD are established. Based on some real famous formal contexts, this paper conducts numerical experiments, and the results show that the incremental CCL algorithm based on three-way OPOSD is consistent with human cognitive principles, and can improve the CCL performance of POFSA as well."

While a myriad of safety approaches have been adopted in the industry through normative compliance, error prevention, and climate intervention, the situations remain dismal. One of the reasons for the ineffectiveness of these approaches to ensure construction projects’ safety performance is the mismatch between the approaches’ rigid and static formulations of construction operations that are put to use in the operations that are emergent and dynamic. We propose that the deficiency can be rectified through the project team adaptive inputs and interactions that are grounded in the project team social capital. We (1) explore such possibility by establishing the theoretical underpinning through extant literature and (2) propose a conceptual framework befitting a relational approach to ensuring project safety outcomes. To accomplish the objectives set forth above, we conduct literature search and review in the domains of social capital, construction safety, social psychology, and small team research. Through the process of convergent and refinement of the literary domains, we put forth a conceptual framework that can be put into empirical test. The framework reveals that project team social capital can be modeled as a multi-level phenomenon emanating from individual level network structure. These structural features, together with the relational and cognitive features at the group level, influence the individual safety behaviors, and in turn, their safety outcomes. The analysis through literature review and modeling have shown that project team members’ safety behaviors are influenced by the interaction of both the individual and group level relational phenomena. This study enriches current safety research agenda by highlighting the effects of team dynamics in safety performance. In this respect, we also provide methodological suggestions to empirically test the framework."

However, such an approach cannot completely convert consumer emotional perceptions into design elements. Therefore, this study combined the ergonomic technology used in Kansei engineering with the unique cognitive ability of humans to identify patterns and establish an emotional perception model that can integrate the overall interrelations of the constituent elements. Steering wheel design was used as the object of examination. Three types of adjectives were applied to describe the constituent elements. The first type was esthetic factors and involve external esthetics. The second type comprised two pairs of adjectives, sturdy/delicate and lightweight/heavy, called operational strength factors because they relate to form and strength. The third type comprised simplistic/changeful and artificial/spontaneous, called modernity factors because they pertain to the modern sense of beauty of the parts. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to construct a Kansei engineering model and compare the performance of individual elements and the product as a whole. The results show that the R2 values in the overall model were greater than those in the element-oriented model, indicating that the integrated model outperformed the element-oriented model in variance explanation. The differences between the numerical values of the adjective pairs classic/fashionable (esthetic factors), sturdy/delicate (operational strength factors), and simplistic/changeful and artificial/spontaneous (modernity factors) were significant, demonstrating that the overall model is useful in predicting how consumers make assessments according to emotional perceptions. The R2 increase of the modernity factors was the most obvious, indicating that the overall model assesses modernity more accurately. Comparing results and verifying test samples demonstrated that the overall model is more useful in predicting consumer appraisals that are based on emotional perception. Relevance to industry This study determined that esthetics, operational strength, and modernity are the three most crucial factors in the emotional perceptions and preferences of consumer regarding steering wheel design. The results demonstrate that a model that integrates constituent elements can evaluate consumer behavior and assist product designers in understanding consumers."

By this fact, it is necessary to have the means to easiest the acquirement of necessary information throughout the extraction of the knowledge in order to assist operator in the decision-making process. In this sense, a context-sensitive recommendation system can identify a situation from patterns of events. From the recognition of a situation in a particular ontological context, a proactive approach based on knowledge seems to be more effective for this task. The industrial alarm management system, generally used in supervision systems and process controls, has a problem related to the cognitive overload of their operators. Unfortunately, this occurs mainly during perturbations in the process. In this context, this work aims to investigate and develop methods to adopt proper actions sensitive to the present situation in an industrial alarm management system through semantic web technology and machine learning techniques. This problem involves questions related to the way of obtaining the context data, the context model that describes the situation and the way in which the context data of the plant are related, which allows to infer a situation. In this sense, it is proposed the appliance of data mining techniques to obtain knowledge of the process, taken into consideration an adaptive interface that makes non-intrusive recommendations and help the operator in an industrial plant. To combine deterministic knowledge with probabilistic knowledge, a Bayesian Networks is used. For the concept evaluation, a case study was conducted based on a real historical database, which shows sound and promising results."

Consequently, in order to solve the fuzziness and uncertainty of preference information in the matching process of complex product manufacturing tasks on the cloud manufacturing platform, a novel two-sided matching model based on dual hesitant fuzzy preference information is proposed. Firstly, the two-sided matching problem and the dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) are described. Then, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is constructed and normalized according to the preference information provided by agents on both sides. Sequentially, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is transformed into the satisfaction degree matrix by the projection technology. Simultaneously, considering the stable matching constraint, a multi-objective two-sided matching optimization model which maximizes the satisfaction degree and minimizes the difference degree of two-sided agents is established. Further, the matching relative competition degree is used to convert the multi-objective optimization model into a single-objective optimization model, and the matching algorithm is designed for solving the model. Moreover, an illustrative example is employed to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the developed model. Subsequently, the sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the stability of the proposed matching results, and the comparative analysis is carried out to illustrate the reliability of the proposed matching algorithm and the merits of the developed model. It reveals that the proposed model can not only obtain stable matching results but also give more choices in matching methods."

Emphasis is placed, however, on studying the nexus between some of the recent results obtained with CWA and the original field studies of human problem-solving that motivated the framework’s development. Of particular interest is a case study of the use of CWA for military doctrine development, a problem commonly regarded as lying outside the fields of human factors and engineering. It is concluded that the value of CWA, even for such diverse problems, is likely to result from its conceptual grounding in empirical observations of patterns of human reasoning in complex systems."

For these smart robots to make their own decisions about where to go and what to do, they need to be limited by several algorithms that run continuously and at the same time. Autonomy is the range of automated systems that can be adapted to a specific mission, residual risk, and level of team cohesion between humans and robots. Self-driving robotic systems should be collaborative, which means they should be able to interact actively with humans in a shared space or in proximity to humans and robots. Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC) works better when these COBOTs are aware of their surroundings. Mobile Robot (MR) teams whose perceptual and cognitive abilities are very well developed can help a lot with context awareness. To work well with humans, these robots should know what is going on with their human and other robot teammates so they can make decisions on their own. Also, robots should be able to share information about their surroundings so that humans can benefit from a better understanding of the situation. At the same time, humans should be able to see what the robots are doing. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based framework for humans and robots to work together to understand the context of Defense missions. An ontological model of contexts for missions, agents, and situations; a knowledge base comprising all the tools necessary for a sort of situation; and an efficient and reliable method of collaborative learning are some of its main contributions. The framework works well in terms of how long it takes for people to talk to each other. As the team continues to expand, it can also easily manage communication challenges and a widely differing event frequency range."

However, this deployment creates an interference scenario; mainly, the problem occurs severely from the users of the connected and autonomous vehicle in MeNBs coverage to HeNBs coverage. The main reason is that deploying HeNBs in MeNBs applies the co-subchannels by HeNB and MeNB, leading to severe cross-tier interference (CSI) in the OFDMA subcarrier. Due to this CSI occurrence, the spectral efficiency, Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR), and system outages affect severely. As a result, the MeNB User Equipment (MUEs) and HeNB User Equipment (HUEs) suffer from service disruption, and the entire system’s performance degrades. This challenge has attracted the attention of many researchers and the telecom industries. As a result, several interferences controlling methods such as enhanced frequency allocation strategies, power management, control technique, resource scheduling, spectrum sharing, and Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques have been suggested for 5G communications. However, the study suggests that downlink interference is still challenging in dense urban zones, especially in multilevel and high-rise complex buildings. This paper proposes the EBBDSA-CSI technique where a novel Evolutionary Biogeography-based Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation (EBBDSA) algorithm is introduced for reducing the cross-tier Subcarriers interference (CSI) issues in MeNB and HeNB. The system-level simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm reduces the system outage to 88.1%, and total spectral efficiency achieves 83.6% compared to the existing techniques."

It is expected that successful products give the consumer ""extraordinary experiences"". The research in consumption experience is growing, but much work still needs to be done to understand the food and beverage experience. A qualitative study was conducted using contextual focus groups to explore the building blocks of consumers' drinking experience of industrial and craft beers. The results show that drinking experience is shaped by our cognitive, sensory or affective systems, especially during the core consumption experience. Elements such as attitudes, consumption habits, and individual versus social consumption, shopping experience and product benefits are also responsible for shaping the experience, but are more relevant during the pre-consumption or post-consumption experience. Gender differences occur more frequently in the affective experience, as women search more for relaxation while men for excitement and stimulation while drinking beer. When comparing industrial users versus craft, in the latter the cognitive and shopping experiences are more relevant. Overall, the results showed that the drinking experience of beers can be studied as a function of the salient human system used during product interaction, and this systems act as the building blocks of the drinking experience of beer. This information can be applied in consumer research studies to further study the experiential differences across products and consumers."

Like the low-carbon transformation, the process of industrialisation was above all an energy regime change. However, industrialisation cannot be solely reduced to a fundamental change in the energy system. The “global methamorphosis” towards industrial societies was driven by economic, cultural and social processes progressing at different speeds. Transformations are actually the result of “Häufigkeitsverdichtungen von Veränderungen” (Osterhammel, 2009), a concurrence of multiple changes. The non-linearity of far-reaching transformations becomes particularly apparent in the non-parallelism between the history of ideas and real socio-economic changes. The social, cultural and cognitive “software” of modern societies was already developed by the thinkers of the Enlightenment. The concept of “Sustainability” follows very similar trajectories. Against this background the concept of a social contract for sustainability gains relevance. It symbolises that the transformation to sustainability implies a fundamental realignment of societies, which requires the legitimation of their citizens. In the last part of his paper the author describes emerging pillars for the social contract of sustainability. An optimistic interpretation of these trends would be: although global emissions are still rising, in many societies the cognitive, normative and cultural conditions for a sustainability transformation are now being established."

However, new online video data sources present an increasing complexity, with visual cues trapped in hours of video data with no automated means to easily locate and extract key data nuggets. The solution is the introduction of disruptive concepts with an ‘operational experimentation’ focus to mimic the customer's approach. This new method will embrace the larger ‘tell me a story’ perceptive approach to automate the process of building a user defined text story representation based on the accurate discovery / identification of relevant content in the online videos. This paper will cover overall components of the operational experimentation methodology which is part of a long-term (12-24 month) software research and development (R&D) prototyping strategy to operationalize software through a customer driven partnership. This methodology borrows ideas from multiple disciplines including cognitive ergonomics, computer science and industrial engineering. This case study emphasizes the importance of incorporating how humans cognitively process film based stimulation as a ‘story’, to design a system that will assist humans by automating the processing of online social media based video streams and imagery. The significance of this work demonstrates a paradigm shift in how automated video analysis is designed and accomplished through sharing pros and cons of selecting and operationally testing analytics through a series of vignettes. Beginning with an on-line video and concluding with a text based story of that video that is now searchable, understandable, and available to traditional cloud based analytics tailored to an organization's particular needs. This paper will include the results of the customer's experience through the seven stages of the operational experimentation process for Phase 1 of system development."

Statistics from recent years have shown that the risk level of some DP operations is above the industry's risk criteria. Operators have a significant impact on incidents’ consequences by making responsive decisions. In emergencies, one is afforded little time to make a decision. Available risk models are not efficient enough to provide systems’ risk level in a short period of time. In this study, the application of a new supervised methodology to assist decision making in emergencies is proposed. This method significantly reduces the processing and execution time of a system's probabilistic risk assessment models. In this methodology, the most probable failure scenarios are generated using an optimization model. The objective of the optimization model in this study is to find scenarios with the highest occurrence probabilities. The constraints are a system's dynamic simulation and its risk model. The proposed method is applied to three incidents that occurred in the Norwegian offshore sector in previous years. The results show that the model can predict the most probable scenarios with an acceptable accuracy in a very short time."

As the primary cause of software defects, human error can be the key to understanding and preventing software defects. This paper proposes a defect prevention approach based on human error mechanisms: DPeHE. The approach includes both knowledge and regulation training in human error prevention. Knowledge training provides programmers with explicit knowledge on why programmers commit errors, what kinds of errors tend to be committed under different circumstances, and how these errors can be prevented. Regulation training further helps programmers to promote the awareness and ability to prevent human errors through practice. The practice is facilitated by a problem solving checklist and a root cause identification checklist. This paper provides a systematic framework that integrates knowledge across disciplines, e.g., cognitive science, software psychology and software engineering to defend against human errors in software development. Furthermore, we applied this approach in an international company at CMM Level 5 and a software development institution at CMM Level 1 in the Chinese Aviation Industry. The application cases show that the approach is feasible and effective in promoting developers’ ability to prevent software defects, independent of process maturity levels."

However, the accident rate hasn’t dropped significantly with the advanced technology onboard. The main cause of this phenomenon is human errors which drive researchers to study human factors in the maritime domain. One of the key factors that contribute to human performance is their mental states such as cognitive workload and stress. In this paper, we propose and implement an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based psychophysiological evaluation system to be used in maritime virtual simulators for monitoring, training and assessing the seafarers. The system includes an EEG processing part, visualization part, and an evaluation part. By using the processing part of the system, different brain states including cognitive workload and stress can be identified from the raw EEG data recorded during maritime exercises in the simulator. By using the visualization part, the identified brain states, raw EEG signals, and videos recorded during the maritime exercises can be synchronized and displayed together. By using the evaluation part of the system, an indicative recommendation on “pass”, “retrain”, or “fail” of the seafarers’ performance can be obtained based on the EEG-based cognitive workload and stress recognition. Detailed analysis of the demanding events in the maritime tasks is provided by the system for each seafarer that could be used to improve their training. A case study is presented using the proposed system. EEG data from 4 pilots were recorded when they were performing maritime tasks in the simulator. The data are processed and evaluated. The results show that one pilot gets a “pass” recommendation, one pilot gets a “retrain” recommendation, and the other two get “fail” results regarding their performance in the simulator."

Although cumulative evidence pointed out a positive impact of these visualization technologies on construction task performance, there is still an obvious disagreement on the benefits or implications of these new visualization technologies, due to the lack of understanding of the mechanisms in which the visualization affects cognitive processes related to information processing. To obtain more evidence, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 90) to investigate the impact of information format on the performance of an industrial pipeline maintenance task. The investigation centers around how different engineering information formats affect the attention patterns as a potential explanation for the changes in performance. A between-group experiment design was used where the participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups (2D group, 3D group, and VR group) depending on what type of information was given to review the pipe operation instruction. After the review session, the participants were asked to perform the operation task in the virtual environment based on their memory. The results showed that the 3D and VR groups outperformed the 2D group in task performance. The analysis of eye-tracking data further indicated that the information format significantly changed the gaze scanning pattern when participants were reviewing the operational instructions. We also found that the task performance was correlated with eye-tracking features including gaze movement and pupil dilation. Our findings provided more evidence about the mechanisms in which new visualization technologies affect the attention patterns, helped resolve the current disagreement within the literature. In addition, a prediction model was proposed to use eye-tracking features to predict construction task performance."

After delving into three pivotal AXˆIS concepts – robotic anthropomorphism, intentionality, and sociality – the study examines their impact on robot likeability and successful human-robot interaction (HRI) implementation. The research introduces the concept of robotic xˆenocentrism (represented by perceived inferiority and social aggrandizement) as a new global dimension in social robotics literature, positioning it as a higher-order concept that moderates the impact of pivotal independent variables on robot likeability. Analyzing a sample of 308 respondents in global cross-cultural teams, the study confirms that pivotal AXÍS robotics concepts foster positive robot likeability and successful HRI implementation for both industrial and social robots. Perceived inferiority negatively moderated the relationship between anthropomorphism and robot likeability, but it was a positive moderator between intentionality and robot likeability. However, social aggrandizement did not act as a significant boundary condition. Sociality remains unaffected by the moderating influence of xˆenocentrism. The study concludes by outlining future research directions for AXˆIS robotics."

However, evaluation and control of shape features are done in trial and error based on the experience and intuition of the designer, causing the inefficiency of styling design. Therefore, this study aims to support the styling design by quantifying cognitive characteristics in curved surface shape. First, this research proposed total absolute curvature to quantify “complexity”, which is one of the shape features related to “beauty”, and described its geometric meaning as the total area of the Gauss map on the curved surface shape. Next, the tangible calculation method is shown by applying it to the curved surface shape represented by a triangular polygon mesh. Then, sensory evaluation experiments were carried out using three types of shapes generated by extrusion, rotation, and emergent shape generation system to confirm the applicability of the proposed quantification method.

Users of eHealth apps are naturally very diverse in terms of their human aspects, e.g., their age, gender, emotional reactions to the apps, cognitive style, physical and mental challenges. Unfortunately, many eHealth apps do not take these user differences sufficiently into account, making them ineffective or even unusable. Objective: This paper reports a study from eHealth app stakeholders’ – developers and end-users – perspectives on critical challenges and benefits of better incorporating human aspects into eHealth app development and usage. We also investigate how different human aspects are being addressed by developers, which ones are the most important for different user groups, and which ones are currently missing/poorly handled. Method: A mixed-method approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative research was used for this study. We gathered and analyzed data from 240 online survey responses and 25 detailed interviews within the same study and validated the results. Results: We report key issues encountered in eHealth app design, difficulty in addressing different human aspects, areas requiring further research and practical assistance, and recommend our findings to best address these challenges. We found addressing human aspects throughout the app development life-cycle is beneficial for more effective eHealth apps. Our findings also suggest the need for improved standards and guidelines, better developer-user collaborative culture, and better human aspects education to produce more effective eHealth apps. Conclusion: This paper investigates current approaches used in the eHealth app domain that take into account the human aspects of app users. The paper guides eHealth app stakeholders, future researchers, academia and industry partners be aware of human aspects related challenges and improve produce apps."

But, these two modeling paradigms are limited in the domains of multiple monitor environments. Although the schematic model based on neural mechanisms can represent human visual systems in multiple monitor environments by providing a detailed account of eye and head movements, these models cannot easily be applied in complex cognitive interactions. On the other hand, the cognitive architectures can model the interaction of multiple aspects of cognition, but these architectures have not focused on modeling the visual orienting behavior of eye and head movements. Thus, in this study, a specific cognitive architecture, which is ACT-R, is extended by an existing schematic model of human visual systems based on neural mechanisms in order to model human performance in multiple monitor environments more accurately. And, this study proposes a method of modeling human performance using the extended ACT-R. The proposed method is validated by an experiment, confirming that the proposed method is able to predict human performance more accurately in multiple monitor environments. Relevance to industry Predicting human performance with a computational model can be used as an alternative method to implementing iterative user testing for developing a system interface. The computational model in this study can predict human performance in multiple monitor environments, so that the model can be applied early on in the design phase, to evaluate the system interface in multiple monitor environments."

A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks.

Conflict trials resulted more complex and time-consuming than no conflicts, requiring more frequent fixations and saccades. Moreover, large saccades showed reduced burst power with higher task complexity.

Objective This paper describes a functional reference architecture for autonomous driving, along with various considerations that influence such an architecture. The functionality is described at the logical level, without dependence on specific implementation technologies. Method Engineering design has been used as the research method, which focuses on creating solutions intended for practical application. The architecture has been refined and applied over a 5 year period to the construction of prototype autonomous vehicles in three different categories, with both academic and industrial stakeholders. Results The architectural components are divided into categories pertaining to (i) perception, (ii) decision and control, and (iii) vehicle platform manipulation. The architecture itself is divided into two layers comprising the vehicle platform and a cognitive driving intelligence. The distribution of components among the architectural layers considers two extremes: one where the vehicle platform is as “dumb” as possible, and the other, where the vehicle platform can be treated as an autonomous system with limited intelligence. We recommend a clean split between the driving intelligence and the vehicle platform. The architecture description includes identification of stakeholder concerns, which are grouped under the business and engineering categories. A comparison with similar architectures is also made, wherein we claim that the presence of explicit components for world modeling, semantic understanding, and vehicle platform abstraction seem unique to our architecture. Conclusion The concluding discussion examines the influences of implementation technologies on functional architectures and how an architecture is affected when a human driver is replaced by a computer. The discussion also proposes that reduction and acceleration of testing, verification, and validation processes is the key to incorporating continuous deployment processes."

It is a crucial step in QFD to derive the prioritization of design requirements (DRs) from CRs for a product. However, effective prioritization of DRs is seriously challenged due to two types of uncertainties: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. This paper tries to propose a novel two-stage group decision-making approach to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD. The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers’ fuzzy preference relations into an overall one by fuzzy majority. Two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing approaches. Implementation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and model customer heterogeneity and design team’s preference. Due to its easiness, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in QFD planning. Extensions to the proposed approach are also given to address application contexts involving a wider set of HOQ elements."

This mainly concerns the area of industrial production, where the aim is to apply new technologies on the principle of artificial intelligence, using the possibilities of a new direction in the use of a technology called the Internet of Things (IoT). With this idea, however, the question of the user disappears, who in this chaos of massive information can get into a state, where his activities will no longer be manageable. To cope with this situation, it is necessary to examine the impact of these technologies on the quality of life in the work and home environment. This paper investigates process modelling and the creation of predictive models to obtain the emotional state of users. The created predictive models will later allow the simulation of complex sensory systems, which will be able to predict the emotional states of users based on their physiological states. The aim is to also find connections between physiological states and basic emotions to be able to classify user emotions with the highest possible accuracy in the classification process."

One of the main reasons behind this trend is the fact that most experts agree that truly intelligent artificial system is yet to be developed. The question increasing often asked is this: Is full replication of human intelligence desirable key aim in intelligence related technology and research? In this context, the concept of Augmented Intelligence, also known as Cognitive Augmentation or Intelligence Amplification (IA) comes into play. One of the main reasons behind this interest in this concept is the potential of such technologies to revolutionize human life as they intend to work under complex decision-making environments, adapting to a comprehensive range of unforeseen changes, and exhibiting prospective behavior. The combination of these properties aims to enhance human capabilities and create more intelligent and efficient human-centered environments. In this paper we discuss how Decisional DNA (DDNA), a multi-domain knowledge structure that has the Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) at its core can be utilized as an experience-based intelligence augmentation in a number of different domains."

Could the speed of this activity be doubled? This paper explores this hypothetical question, starting with examination of a diverse set of case studies spanning the activities of manufacturing. This reveals that the constraints on increasing manufacturing speed have some common themes, and several of these are examined in more detail, to identify absolute limits to performance. The physical processes of production are constrained by factors such as machine stiffness, actuator acceleration, heat transfer and the delivery of fluids, and for each of these, a simplified model is used to analyse the gap between current and limiting performance. The wider systems of production require the co-ordination of resources and push at the limits of human biophysical and cognitive limits. Evidence about these is explored and related to current practice. Out of this discussion, five promising innovations are explored to show examples of how manufacturing speed is increasing—with line arrays of point actuators, parallel tools, tailored application of precision, hybridisation and task taxonomies. The paper addresses a broad question which could be pursued by a wider community and in greater depth, but even this first examination suggests the possibility of unanticipated innovations in current manufacturing practices."

Recently, the deep neural network has become a powerful learning machine, making it possible to work with text itself as raw input for the classification problems. However, existing neural networks are typically end-to-end and lack explicit interpretation of the prediction. In this paper, we propose Jumper, a novel framework that models text classification as a sequential decision process. Generally, Jumper is a neural system that scans a piece of text sequentially and makes classification decisions at the time it wishes, which is inspired by the cognitive process of human text reading. In our framework, both the classification result and when to make the classification are part of the decision process, controlled by a policy network and trained with reinforcement learning. Experimental results of real-world applications demonstrate the following properties of a properly trained Jumper: (1) it tends to make decisions whenever the evidence is enough, therefore reducing total text reading by 30–40% and often finding the key rationale of the prediction; and (2) it achieves classification accuracy better than or comparable to state-of-the-art models in several benchmark and industrial datasets. We further conduct a simulation experiment with mock data, which confirms that Jumper is able to make a decision at the theoretically optimal decision position."

Consequently, interaction (e.g. manipulation) was treated separately from whole-body posture (e.g. balancing), assuming the robot firmly connected to the ground. Foreseen applications involve robots with augmented autonomy and physical mobility. Within this novel context, physical interaction influences stability and balance. To allow robots to surpass barriers between interaction and posture control, forthcoming robotic research needs to investigate the principles governing whole-body motion and coordination with contact dynamics. There is a need to investigate the principles of motion and coordination of physical interaction, including the aspects related to unpredictability. Recent developments in compliant actuation and touch sensing allow safe and robust physical interaction from unexpected contact including humans. The next advancement for cognitive robots, however, is the ability not only to cope with unpredictable contact, but also to exploit predictable contact in ways that will assist in goal achievement. Last but not least, theoretical results needs to be validated in real-world scenarios with humanoid robots engaged in whole-body goal-directed tasks. Robots should be capable of exploiting rigid supportive contacts, learning to compensate for compliant contacts, and utilizing assistive physical interaction from humans. The work presented in this paper presents state-of-the-art in these domains as well as some recent advances made within the framework of the CoDyCo European project."

Humans, however, actively test for functionally relevant object properties before such operations begin, even when no previous percepts of a particular object's qualities in the domain have been established. We hypothesize that such prospective diagnostic interventions are a human specialization of cognitive function that has been entirely overlooked in the neuropsychological literature. We presented chimpanzees with visually identical rakes: one was functional for retrieving a food reward; the other was non-functional (its base was spring-loaded). Initially, they learned that only the functional tool could retrieve a distant reward. In test 1, we explored if they would manually test for the rakes' rigidity during tool selection, but before using it. We found no evidence of such behavior. In test 2, we obliged the apes to deform the non-functional tool's base before using it, in order to evaluate whether this would cause them to switch rakes. It did not. Tests 3–6 attempted to focus the apes' attention on the functionally relevant property (rigidity). Although one ape eventually learned to abandon the non-functional rake before using it, she still did not attempt to test the rakes for rigidity prior to use. While these results underscore the ability of chimpanzees to use novel tools, at the same time they point toward a fundamental (and heretofore unexplored) difference in causal reasoning between humans and apes. We propose that this behavioral difference reflects a human specialization in how object properties are represented, which could have contributed significantly to the evolution of our technological culture. We discuss developing a new line of evolutionarily motivated neuropsychological research on action disorders."

Fortunately, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can integrate human intelligence into the collaborative robot (cobot), which can realize not merely the nimble and sapiential maintenance operations of personnel but also the reliable and repeated maintenance manipulation of cobots. However, the existing HRC maintenance lacks the precise understand of the maintenance intention, the efficient HRC decision-making for executing robotized maintenance tasks (e.g., repetitive manual tasks) and the convenient interaction interface for executing cognitive tasks (e.g., maintenance preparation and guidance job). Hence, a mixed perception-based human-robot collaborative maintenance approach consisting of three-hierarchy structures is proposed in this paper, which can help reduce the severity of the mentioned problems. In the first stage, a mixed perception module is proposed to help the cobot recognize human safety and maintenance request according to human actions and gestures separately. During the second stage, an improved online deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making module with the asynchronous structure and the function of anti-disturbance is proposed in this paper, which can realize the execution of robotized maintenance tasks. In the third stage, an augmented reality-assisted (AR) user-friendly interaction interface is designed to help the personnel interact with the cobot and execute the auxiliary maintenance task without the limitation of spatial and human factors. In addition, the auxiliary of maintenance operation can also be supported by the AR-assisted visible guidance. Finally, comparative numerical experiments are implemented in a typical machining workshop, and the experimental results show a competitive performance of the proposed HRC maintenance approach compared with other state-of-the-art methods."

Such skills decay if they are not rehearsed repeatedly, e.g. in refresher interventions. A promising concept to counteract skill decay is gaze guiding, which has the potential to reduce the consequences of skill decay by means of cued recall. The present study explores whether gaze guiding can be used as an alternative to refresher interventions. Fifty-five participants learned a complex cognitive skill required for a production task. After two weeks, they recalled the initially learned skill either with support of the gaze-guiding tool (Gaze-Guiding group) or without support (Practice-refresher intervention group or Control group). The participants of the Practice-refresher intervention group repeated the initially learned skill in week 2. The results show that gaze guiding supports the precise execution of a task and is a promising technical tool for cued recall and retrieval support. Relevance to industry Refresher interventions are popular methods for skill retention. A resource-saving alternative is an adaptive computer-based job aid which supports the operator's skill retrieval in the recall situation. It is a further development of step-by-step guidance with computer-based procedures and appears only when the operator fails to remember the task operation."

As emotions have substantial influence on cognitive processes of the human brain such as learning, memory, perception and problem solving, emotional interactions benefit different applications. It can further be relevant in modern health care especially in interaction with patients suffering from stress or depression. Additionally rehabilitation applications, guiding patients through their rehabilitation training while adapting to the patients emotional state, would be highly motivating and might lead to a faster recovery. Depending on the application area, different systems for emotion recognition suit different purposes. The aim of this work is to give an overview of methods to recognize emotions and to compare their applicability based on existing studies. This review paper should enable practitioners, researchers and engineers to find a system most suitable for certain applications. An entirely contact-less method is to analyze facial features with the help of a video camera. This is useful when computers, smart-phones or tablets with integrated cameras are included in the task. Smart wearables provide contact with the skin and physiological parameters such as electro-dermal activity and heart related signals can be recorded unobtrusively also during dynamical tasks. Next to unimodal solutions, multimodal affective computing systems are analyzed since they promise higher classification accuracy. Accuracy varies based on the amount of detected emotions, extracted features, classification method and the quality of the database. Electroencephalography achieves 88.86 % accuracy for four emotions, multimodal measurements (Electrocardiography, Electromyography and bio-signals) 79.3 % for four emotive states, facial recognition 89 % for seven states and speech recognition 80.46 % for happiness and sadness. Looking forward, heart-related parameters might be an option to measure emotions accurately and unobtrusive with the help of smart wearables. This can be used in dynamic or outdoor tasks. Facial recognition on the other hand is a useful contact-less tool when it comes to emotion recognition during computer interaction."

Eighteen participants performed a simulated industrial assembly operation, including one trial with no interruption and eight others presenting an interruption task. Interruption conditions comprised a full crossing of task similarity to the primary assembly operation (similar, dissimilar) and complexity (simple, complex) with replication for each participant. Order of condition presentation was randomized. Findings revealed greater time to return to primary visual-manual assembly performance after a similar task interruption. Results also indicated complex interruptions may promote cognitive arousal that increases productivity following assembly interruptions. The majority of results are explained in terms of the Activation-Based Memory for Goals model. Findings provide some guidance for interruption management protocol design for workers engaged in procedural visual-manual assembly operations."

The purpose of this study was to examine, whether exposure to CO2 at 5000 ppm would cause sensory discomfort, evoke acute health symptoms, reduce the performance of cognitive tasks, or result in changes in physiological responses. The outdoor air supply rate was set high enough in a low-emission stainless-steel climate chamber to create a reference condition with CO2 at 500 ppm when subjects were present, and chemically pure CO2 was added to the supply air to create an exposure condition with CO2 at 5000 ppm (the measured exposure level was ca. 4900 ppm). Ten healthy college-age students were exposed twice to each of the two conditions for 2.5 h in a design balanced for order of presentation. The raised CO2 concentration had no effect on perceived air quality or physiological responses except for end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), which increased more (to 5.3 kPa) than it was in the reference condition (5.1 kPa). Other results indicate additionally that a 2.5-h exposure to CO2 up to 5000 ppm did not increase intensity of health symptoms reported by healthy young individuals and their performance of simple or moderately difficult cognitive tests and some tasks resembling office work. These results accord well with the current occupational exposure limit recommendation for CO2 and with many other reports published in the literature."

A human factors challenge at this level is to keep the fallback-ready user aware of the driving situation. The problem with the widely accepted terminology of SAE is that it does not consider the human factors of achieving this safety-critical transition and lacks in defining a required or appropriate state of fallback readiness and how a human reaches this state. This paper aims to understand how research and industry currently perceive the problem and how they counteract it. We conducted exploratory expert interviews with N = 15 subject matter experts from universities, research centres and vehicle manufacturers. Based on the findings of the expert interviews, we discuss how fallback-ready users might be kept in the loop. The results show that the user should remain physically and sensory in the state of regular drivers to allow a safe transition, which narrows down the problem to maintaining an appropriate cognitive state, level of arousal, and motivational conditions. Lastly, the experts identify that the NDRA should be (a) limited to the onboard-entertainment system and (b) context-aware and (temporarily) restricted or interrupted. We provide concrete design recommendations grounded in (or drawing upon) theoretical frameworks and current human factors expert views and highlight specific challenges that require more research."

As emerging visualization technologies, such as Virtual Reality, are considered as a promising solution, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanism by which different information visualization methods affect AEC task performance. Cognition literature has discovered a strong relationship between attention and memory development, but little has been done to understand how the visual attention patterns during the design documents review affect the effectiveness of spatial memory in AEC tasks. To fill the knowledge gap, this paper presents a human-subject experiment (n = 63) to test how spatial knowledge is acquired in a building inspection task and how the different visual attention patterns affect the development of spatial memory. Participants were asked to review the design information of a real building on campus. To trigger different attention patterns, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups based on the forms of information given in the review session, including 2D, 3D, and VR groups. After a brief review session, participants were asked to go to the real building to identify discrepancies (based on memory) that were intentionally inserted by the authors. The inspection performance was used to evaluate the spatial memory development. The results indicate that in general there is a positive relationship between test subjects’ visual attention (fixation time) and spatial memory, but the increasing rate varies across the three groups, suggesting that visual context plays a critical role in the development efficiency of spatial memory. The findings also indicate that the visual attention – spatial memory relationship may be mediated by the use of different spatial knowledge acquisition strategies. This study is expected to contribute to the construction information technology literature by setting the cornerstone of a cognition-driven information system that tailors into the spatial cognitive process of AEC professionals."

Industrial and working environments, health-care assistance in public or domestic areas can benefit from robots' services to accomplish manifold tasks that are difficult and annoying for humans. In such scenarios, Natural Language interactions, enabling collaboration and robot control, are meant to be situated, in the sense that both the user and the robot access and make reference to the environment. Contextual knowledge may thus play a key role in solving inherent ambiguities of grounded language as, for example, the prepositional phrase attachment. In this work, we present a linguistic pipeline for semantic processing of robotic commands, that combines discriminative structured learning, distributional semantics and contextual evidence extracted from the working environment. The final goal is to make the interpretation process of linguistic exchanges depending on physical, cognitive and language-dependent aspects. We present, formalize and discuss an adaptive Spoken Language Understanding chain for robotic commands, that explicitly depends on the operational context during both the learning and processing stages. The resulting framework allows to model heterogeneous information concerning the environment (e.g., positional information about the objects and their properties) and to inject it in the learning process. Empirical results demonstrate a significant contribution of such additional dimensions, achieving up to a 25% of relative error reduction with respect to a pipeline that only exploits linguistic evidence."

The key to success in coping with this change, which can be seen in all industries, is to break up old structures and venture something new. The ability to adapt and innovate is becoming a central success-critical factor in entrepreneurial activity. In order to continue to achieve market success and ensure sustainable growth in an extremely dynamic and disruptive environment, enterprises and organisations are called upon to proactively shape change. In addition to the establishment of flexible working models and agile processes, the increased generation and integration of knowledge into and around technical systems in the course of targeted competence development of employees is indispensable. The introduction and use of technical systems thus must go hand in hand with the flexibilisation of innovation and collaboration processes as well as the development of employee skills in order to generate the currently missing socio-technological link – for companies´ added value and for the benefit of people.

In this work, we propose the use of an integrated machine intelligence architecture to help address the significant control difficulties that prevent laser welding from seeing its full potential in process engineering and production. This architecture combines three contemporary machine learning techniques to allow a laser welding controller to learn and improve in a self-directed manner. As a first contribution of this work, we show how a deep, auto-encoding neural network is capable of extracting salient, low-dimensional features from real high-dimensional laser welding data. As a second contribution and novel integration step, these features are then used as input to a temporal-difference learning algorithm (in this case a general-value-function learner) to acquire important real-time information about the process of laser welding; temporally extended predictions are used in combination with deep learning to directly map sensor data to the final quality of a welding seam. As a third contribution and final part of our proposed architecture, we suggest that deep learning features and general-value-function predictions can be beneficially combined with actor–critic reinforcement learning to learn context-appropriate control policies to govern welding power in real time. Preliminary control results are demonstrated using multiple runs with a laser-welding simulator. The proposed intelligent laser-welding architecture combines representation, prediction, and control learning: three of the main hallmarks of an intelligent system. As such, we suggest that an integration approach like the one described in this work has the capacity to improve laser welding performance without ongoing and time-intensive human assistance. Our architecture therefore promises to address several key requirements of modern industry. To our knowledge, this architecture is the first demonstrated combination of deep learning and general value functions. It also represents the first use of deep learning for laser welding specifically and production engineering in general. We believe that it would be straightforward to adapt our architecture for use in other industrial and production engineering settings."

It outperformed human muscle power by orders of magnitude. Nobody imagined that this single invention would evocate massive consequences: The steam engine increased industrial production, led to societal upheaval, and changed the political landscape for the next 100 years. There had been no historical parallel on the effect of a dedicated technical invention on humankind in such a short timeframe. At the beginning of the 21st century, we might experience a similar dynamic. This time, artificial intelligence spread the word of a new era that makes cognitive capabilities available on a large scale. Machines with highly sophisticated mental competencies will turn upside down the knowledge work in every company department, be it marketing, human resources, research and development, customer service, or the even the board of directors. Moreover, this time, intelligent machines will outperform human brain power. This paper argues that the arrival of artificial intelligence at the enterprise pave the way to a wicked problem: It cannot be resolved by tested methodologies, given procedures, and best practices. Instead, it requires a more sophisticated approach: First, companies must involve all relevant stakeholders at the initial stage of deployment because the impact of artificial intelligence is far-reaching. Second, companies must question their given value system because it closely resonates with the capabilities of artificial intelligence machines. Third, companies must conduct controlled experiments, because “divide and rule” do not work anymore to handle machines that mimic human thinking."

Thus, in order to set the appropriate context elements surrounding different working situations of factory actors, this paper proposes a context model aiming to represents user's activity and the circumstances under the decisionmaking process. The literature of related works highlighted the advantages of context-awareness in supporting the dynamic adaptation of information according to user's context. The proposed model in this paper takes advantage from the context notion and the fundaments of the activity theory proposed in cognitive science. The intended model is used in an intelligent assistant system dedicated to assist factory workers in the manufacturing process. The main purpose of the context model is to help the assistant system in handling the process of knowledge adaptation and therefore, avoiding the problems of overload and misinterpretation of the information."

Thermal comfort of a motorcycle rider is then predicted using heat indices. The effect of increase in ambient air temperature on the thermal comfort of a rider wearing a modified ventilated helmet, with venturi effect and backvent on the air flow, and temperature distribution in the region above the head is studied. The results are then compared with the conditions when the rider is wearing a full-face, conventional non-ventilated helmet, ventilated helmet with three vents in front and a helmet with only venturi effect. Results are also compared for the conditions when the rider is not wearing any helmet. It is observed that the venturi effect in a ventilated helmet increases the local air velocities in the air gap as compared to a ventilated helmet with three vents in the front of the helmets. Further, it is observed that backvent in venturi helmet augments the thermal comfort of the rider if the ambient air temperature is less than normal body temperature. When air temperatures are higher than the body temperature (36 °C), it is found that the trends are reversed and ventilated helmets are no longer able to provide thermal comfort to the motorcycle rider. For better understanding of effect of newly designed ventilated helmets on the cognitive performance and the willingness of a rider to wear helmets, subjective evaluation of the prototype of venturi helmet is done. Each set of trials required riders to ride with different types of helmets. Based on the results of numerical simulations of ventilation in helmets and responses from subjective human trials, a set of fluid dynamics and design guidelines is also proposed for the helmet manufacturing industries."

While the corresponding technologies are already available, appropriate safety standards to ensure occupational safety are missing and represent one of the main barriers for introducing direct human-robot cooperation.

The analysis considers technical, human-related, and normative requirements.

Unobtrusive objective measures of mental workload (MWL) are therefore in high demand as indicated by both theory and practice. This pilot study explored the wearability and external validity of pupillometry, a MWL measure robustly validated in laboratory settings and now deployable in work settings demanding operator mobility. In an ecologically valid work environment, 21 participants performed two manual assemblies - one of low and one of high complexity - while wearing eye-tracking glasses for pupil size measurement. Results revealed that the device was perceived as fairly wearable in terms of physical and mental comfort. In terms of validity, no significant differences in mean pupil size were found between the assemblies even though subjective mental workload differed significantly. Exploratory analyses on the pupil size when attending to the assembly instructions only, were inconclusive. The present work suggests that current lab-based procedures might not be adequate yet for in-the-field mobile pupillometry. From a broader perspective, these findings also invite a more nuanced view on the current validity of lab-validated physiological MWL-measures when applied in real-life settings. We therefore conclude with some key insights for future development of mobile pupillometry."

Taking an industrial and organizational (IO) psychology perspective within a behavioral operations research context, this study focuses on erroneous stock-flow thinking and general cognitive ability. It uses data from laboratory experiments to test a mediating structural equation model firmly grounded in IO psychology theory, proposing both a direct concave impact of general cognitive ability on control task performance and an indirect concave effect mediated by stock-flow thinking. With our results we are the first to demonstrate that stock-flow thinking serves as a mediator of general cognitive ability on performance, while at the same time, general cognitive ability non-linearly impacts performance. These findings contribute to theory building in behavioral operational research and demonstrate how adoption of perspectives other than the traditional paradigms used can help. It also has practical implications as it improves the relative assessment of different levers to increase operational control performance. We find that the total impact of general cognitive ability on control performance is higher than the direct effect of stock-flow thinking. Therefore, companies should add stock-flow thinking tests to their personnel selection toolbox, but put more weight on selecting operational managers with high cognitive abilities and somewhat less weight on training efforts that aim to reduce stock-flow failures."

By validating the JITIR concept, several industry scenarios have been evaluated: an exemplary model, concerning the machine tool industry, is presented in the paper. The results of this research are a set of guidelines for the development of a digital factory support tool."

Service or social robots have to function in less controlled and more dynamically changing environments than industrial robots, and the users of social robots are generally less technologically literate than the users of industrial robots, therefore social robots have to be able to interact naturally with humans and to fit in the human social environment. Social robotics faces new challenges that require an interdisciplinary approach. In contrast to previous approaches where the communication and behaviour of social robots were based on human-human interactions, ethorobotics offer a new direction. Today robotics is not advanced enough to reach the physical and cognitive capabilities of humans thus human-animal interaction can serve as a better model for designing the behaviour of social robots. Human-dog relationship is a good example for this paradigm as dogs have similar roles as social robots will have in the future. Dogs acquired social cognitive skills during domestication that enhances the interspecific relationship with humans and helps their interactions. Etho-robotics research uses ethological principles and methods to derive complex behavioural models which can be transcribed to mathematical form and implemented into robots. Human-robot interaction studies can be conducted to evaluate and refine the implemented models. Etho-robotics research was already used to create behavioural models for attachment and for multiple aspects of human-robot interactions. The application of Fuzzy Rule Interpolation methods fits well the conceptually “spare rule-based” structure of the existing descriptive verbal ethological models, as in case of the descriptive verbal ethological models the “completeness” of the rule-base is not required. The main benefit of the FRI method adaptation in ethological model implementation is the fact, that it has a simple rule-based knowledge representation format. Because of this, even after numerical optimization of the model, the rules are still “human readable”, and helps the formal validation of the model by the ethological experts. On the other side due to the FRI base, the model has still low computational demand and fits directly the requirements of the embedded implementations."

Nowadays, the baseline state of the art systems has quite a low accuracy and high computations, which needs upgrading to make it reasonable for real-time industrial uses such as detection of content from speech data. The main intent for low recognition rate and high computational cost is a scarceness of datasets, model configuration, and patterns recognition that is the supreme stimulating work for building a robust SER system. In this study, we address these problems and propose a simple and lightweight deep learning-based self-attention module (SAM) for SER system. The transitional features map is given to SAM, which produces efficiently the channel and spatial axes attention map with insignificant overheads. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in channel attention to extracting global cues and a special dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) in spatial attention to extract spatial info from input tensor. Moreover, we merge, spatial and channel attention maps to produce a combine attention weights as a self-attention module. We placed SAM in the middle of convolutional and connected layers and trained it in an end-to-end mode. The ablation study and comprehensive experimentations are accompanied over IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, and EMO-DB speech emotion datasets. The proposed SER system shows consistent improvements in overall experiments for all datasets and shows 78.01%, 80.00%, and 93.00% average recall, respectively."

Drivers for this growth include recent legislative changes and increased investments by industry and governments, along with increased concern from the general public. People are affected by autonomous decisions every day and the public need to understand the decision-making process to accept the outcomes. However, the vast majority of the applications of XAI/IML are focused on providing low-level ‘narrow’ explanations of how an individual decision was reached based on a particular datum. While important, these explanations rarely provide insights into an agent's: beliefs and motivations; hypotheses of other (human, animal or AI) agents' intentions; interpretation of external cultural expectations; or, processes used to generate its own explanation. Yet all of these factors, we propose, are essential to providing the explanatory depth that people require to accept and trust the AI's decision-making. This paper aims to define levels of explanation and describe how they can be integrated to create a human-aligned conversational explanation system. In so doing, this paper will survey current approaches and discuss the integration of different technologies to achieve these levels with Broad eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (Broad-XAI), and thereby move towards high-level ‘strong’ explanations."

Moreover, there is a widespread feeling in the research community that probably Humans will not accept Robots as trustable Partners if they cannot ascribe some form of awareness and true understanding to them. This means that, in addition to the incremental improvements of Robotic-Bodyware, there will be the need for a substantial jump of the Robotic-Cogniware, namely a new class of Cognitive Architectures for Robots (CARs) that match the requirements and specific constraints of Human–Robot Partnership. The working hypothesis that underlies this paper is that such class of CARs must be bio-inspired, not in the sense of fine-grain imitation of neurobiology but the large framework of embodied cognition. In our opinion, trajectory/gesture formation should be one of the building blocks of bio-inspired CARs because biological motion is a fundamental channel of inter-human partnership, a true body language that allows mutual understanding of intentions. Moreover, one of the main concepts of embodied cognition, related to the importance of motor imagery, is that real (or overt) actions and mental (or covert) actions are generated by the same internal model and support the cognitive capabilities of human skilled subjects. The paper reviews the field of human trajectory formation, revealing in a novel manner the fil rouge that runs through motor neuroscience and proposes a computational framework for a robotic formulation that also addresses the Degrees of Freedom Problem and is formulated in terms of the force-field-based Passive Motion Paradigm."

In engineering practice, the MS act as such filling, defining the image of the technosphere of the 21st century [1]. A similar example is Common Dateware (CDW) [2] that translates the kinetic energy of an operating mechanism (OM) movement in mechatronics through the Resolvers-to-Digital Converters (RDC) [3], in which the output orthogonal signal resolvers are converted into an analog or digital equivalent of movement, realizing the connection between space and time [4]."

In this work, an integrated network, which is capable of recognizing emotion intensity levels from facial images in real time using deep learning technique is proposed. The cognitive study of facial expressions based on expression intensity levels are useful in applications such as healthcare, coboting, Industry 4.0 etc. This work proposes to augment emotion recognition with 2 other important parameters, valence and emotion intensity. This helps in better automated responses by a machine to an emotion. The valence model helps in classifying emotion as positive and negative emotions and discrete model classifies emotions as happy, anger, disgust, surprise and neutral state using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Feature extraction and classification are carried out using CMU Multi-PIE database. The proposed architecture achieves 99.1% and 99.11% accuracy for valence model and discrete model respectively for offline image data with 5-fold cross validation. The average accuracy achieved in real time for valance model and discrete model is 95% & 95.6% respectively. Also, this work contributes to build a new database using facial landmarks, with three intensity levels of facial expressions which helps to classify expressions into low, mild and high intensities. The performance is also tested for different classifiers. The proposed integrated system is configured for real time Human Robot Interaction (HRI) applications on a test bed consisting of Raspberry Pi and RPA platform to assess its performance."
