In addition to measuring physical workload, monitoring operators' cognitive workload is becoming a key element in maintaining a healthy and high-performing working environment in future digitalized manufacturing systems. The current approaches to the measurement of cognitive workload may be inadequate when human operators are faced with a series of new digitalized technologies, where their impact on operators' mental workload and performance needs to be better understood. Therefore, a new method for measuring and determining the cognitive workload is required. Here, we propose a new method for determining cognitive-workload indices in a human-centric environment. The approach provides a method to define and verify the relationships between the factors of task complexity, cognitive workload, operators' level of expertise, and indirectly, the operator performance level in a highly digitalized manufacturing environment. Our strategy is tested in a series of experiments where operators perform assembly tasks on a Wankel Engine block. The physiological signals from heart-rate variability and pupillometry bio-markers of 17 operators were captured and analysed using eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant differences in both cardiac and pupillometry-based cognitive load indices across the four task complexity levels (rest, low, medium, and high). Notably, these developed indices also provide better indications of cognitive load responding to changes in complexity compared to other measures. Additionally, while experts appear to exhibit lower cognitive loads across all complexity levels, further analysis is required to confirm statistically significant differences. In conclusion, the results from both measurement sensors are found to be compatible and in support of the proposed new approach. Our strategy should be useful for designing and optimizing workplace environments based on the cognitive load experienced by operators.","[Ma, Xinyue; Monfared, Radmehr; Grant, Rebecca; Goh, Yee Mey] Loughborough Univ, Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, England",Loughborough University,"Goh, YM (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, England.",r.p.monfared@lboro.ac.uk; y.goh@lboro.ac.uk,"Ma, Xinyue/K-8161-2012; Monfared, Radmehr/E-5245-2010; Goh, Yee Mey/B-3157-2011","Monfared, Radmehr/0000-0002-8782-3426; Goh, Yee Mey/0000-0002-5028-9506; Grant, Rebecca/0000-0001-9804-9934",Loughborough University; Centre for Mathematical Cognition at Loughborough University,Loughborough University; Centre for Mathematical Cognition at Loughborough University,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the equipment and tutorial support from the Centre for Mathematical Cognition at Loughborough University.

Methodologically, the research employs a laboratory experiment, incorporating a controlled setting to meticulously assess the DIA's performance. The experiment used a between-subjects design comparing a group of participants using the DIA against a control group relying on traditional manual methods across a series of assembly tasks. Findings reveal a significant enhancement in the operators' experience, a reduction in cognitive load, and an improvement in the quality of process outputs when the DIA is employed.

If, on the one hand, the last technologies support operator 5.0 to embrace the collaborative potential of human-machine cooperation, on the other hand, the complexity, as well as the rapid evolution of new technologies, could have the potential to produce immediate stress reaction leading to reduce the workers' well-being. Recent studies have proved that the maintenance area is experiencing many innovations in terms of approaches and technologies. In this field, the rapid progress of technological equipment is leading to an increase in the human operators' mental workload. This paper presents preliminary concepts and objectives of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Maintenance Operations. The DSS intends to assist industrial professionals and stakeholders in maintenance tasks characterised by significant cognitive demands. Considering variables such as task complexity and the mental and physical condition of operators involved in a maintenance task, the DSS will provide real-time recommendations for selecting the most suitable operators by promoting a gradual technology introduction, increasing industrial performance, and ensuring the well-being of the workers.

The application of advanced automation technology in manufacturing systems has tremendously increased manufacturing flexibility; however, this creates significant mental pressure for operators who must deal with a series of decisions, and this decreases their job satisfaction. In this study, we primarily investigated how cognitive automation and mechanical automaton in the material handling system affect manufacturing flexibility. Cognitive automation is defined as a computerized system that provides relevant information to operators, thereby reducing the cognitive workload; mechanical automation refers to an automated system to reduce the physical workload. The case of a truck-body production line of a truck company was investigated by applying modified DYNAMO+ + for the material handling system. Then, a simulation program, AnyLogic 6.9.0 was used to investigate the effect of the cognitive and mechanical automation in the material handling system on manufacturing flexibility. The research results showed that the levels of cognitive and mechanical automation of the material handling system were increased by 52.4% and 48.0%, respectively, which resulted in improving manufacturing flexibility by 14.2% in cycle time, 53.3% in downtime, and 26.3% in the number of tasks. Cognitive automation, in particular, contributed total improvements in cycle time and downtime of 64.2% and 74.1%, respectively, which showed that cognitive automation has a very critical effect on manufacturing flexibility in the material handling system.

The results of this study are provided as a contribution to knowledge on the relationship between cognitive workload physiology and automation. Research suggests that changes in eye behavior metrics are related to changes in cognitive workload. Few studies have investigated the relationship between eye behavior metrics physiology measures and levels of automation. A within-subjects experiment involving 18 participants who played an open-source real-time strategy game was conducted. Three different versions of the game were developed, each with a unique static autonomy level designed from Sheridan and Verplank's 10 levels of autonomy (levels 2, 4, and 9). NASA-TLX subject survey ratings, time to complete run, and visual fixation rate were found to be significantly different among automation levels. These findings suggest that assessing visual physiology may be a promising indicator for evaluating cognitive workload when interacting with static autonomy levels. This efforts takes us one step closer to using visual physiology as a useful method for evaluating operator workload in almost real-time. Relevance to industry: Potential applications of this research include development of software that integrates adaptive automation to improve human-computer task performance for high cognitive workload tasks (Air Traffic Control, aircraft piloting, process control, information analyst, etc.).

This paper studies the influence and the potential of gamification techniques in supporting innovative Industry 4.0-enhanced processes in the contemporary warehouse work ecosystem. Gamification in the workplace aims to motivate the employees and increase their involvement in an activity, while at the same time creating a sense of an everyday different experience rather than a set of repetitive and monotonous tasks. Since the design of such a system is a complex process, the most widespread design frameworks are studied, and the emphasis is on the principal game elements and their connection to mobilization mechanisms. Finally, an initial proposal of a gamification framework to support the AR-enhanced order picking process in contemporary logistics centers is provided with an emphasis on the mechanics of a fair and functional reward system. The proposed approach aims to showcase the potential alignment of business processes to human motivation, respecting the differences between tasks and the workers' cognitive workload.","[Bright, Athina G.; Ponis, Stavros T.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Heroon Polytechniou 9, Zografos 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Ponis, ST (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Heroon Polytechniou 9, Zografos 15780, Greece.",athinagbright@gmail.com; staponis@central.ntua.gr,"PONIS, STAVROS/AAC-9945-2019; PONIS, STAVROS/O-1177-2013","PONIS, STAVROS/0000-0002-9544-9219; Bright, Athina G./0000-0001-8746-5991","European Union; Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH-CREATE-INNOVATE [T1EDK-01168]","European Union(European Union (EU)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH-CREATE-INNOVATE","This research has been co-financed by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH-CREATE-INNOVATE (project code T1EDK-01168).",,63,16,17,0,54,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2305-6290,,LOGISTICS-BASEL,Logistics,MAR,2021,5,1,,,,,,,14,10.3390/logistics5010014,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/logistics5010014,,,16,Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,RV1EP,,gold,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000645580600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some research has shown that automation may reduce cognitive workload. However, other work reports that increasing automation does not always lower cognitive workload. These conflicting results suggest that further investigation is needed to identify factors that influence the relationship between automation use and cognitive workload. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how two potential moderators, task complexity and age, influence that relationship. A total of 24 younger and 24 middle-aged adults performed an object identification task that resembled a baggage scanning procedure conducted by airport security personnel. The task was manipulated by varying the level of automation (4 increasing levels) that provided support in identifying objects of interest as well as the complexity of task (two types: component and coordinative). In addition, participants completed a pattern identification and sorting memory task, which helped emulate a knowledge work environment. Performance (i.e., object identification accuracy, average completion time, pattern identification accuracy, and sorting memory task accuracy) and subjective workload (NASA-RTLX score) measures were recorded. Participants also rated the usability of the automation. Overall, results showed that while the use of automation was associated with reduced cognitive workload, both types of task complexity negatively affected this relationship such that increased complexity was associated with a decrease in accuracy. Age did not moderate the relationship between automation and cognitive workload, but there were qualitative differences in terms of how the two age groups perceived the utility and usability of the automated systems. Knowledge generated from this research has implications for the design of future human-automation systems and can be used to inform interface design that is tailored to the needs and preferences of different users and use cases.","[Frazier, Shree; Hass, Zachary; Pitts, Brandon J.] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [McComb, Sara A.; Hass, Zachary] Purdue Univ, Sch Nursing, W Lafayette, IN USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Pitts, BJ (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",bjpitts@purdue.edu,"Hass, Zachary/H-7602-2017","Pitts, Brandon J/0000-0002-6232-6028",,,,,83,2,2,2,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1044-7318,1532-7590,,INT J HUM-COMPUT INT,Int.

Spatial design is frequently represented in two-dimensional (2D) drawings of various views. These views must be combined and decoded by the end user to effectively understand all orientations of a building element and can lead to errors. Advances in three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) and 3D printing have provided promising advancements in the presentation of spatial engineering information. This research investigates cognitive-workload demands of each information format. Cognitive workload is the amount of mental resources required to complete a task from the total available mental resources. Asking subjects to complete a reconstructing task of a simple structure using 2D drawings, a 3D CAD interface, and a 3D printed model introduces the individuals to alternative forms of information presentation. After completing the task, the subjects were surveyed on their perceptions of mental workload in six main factors using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). Through a statistical analysis, there was no difference in mental workload between the three types of information presentation, indicating that the cognitive demands of the mediums are similar. However, there were statistically significant differences in workload factors due to demographic influences, such as occupation and CAD experience levels. In addition, mental workload affected the subject's productivity in task completion. The primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the investigation of mental workload as a factor in spatial understanding, and more specifically, identifying cognitive demands of individuals when presented with spatial engineering information in various formats.","[Dadi, Gabriel B.; Taylor, Timothy R.

Operators in this environment, Operator 4.0, will share knowledge through the use of new digital technologies that should be implemented in parallel with an organizational development towards Organization 4.0. On an individual level within the organization, people benefit from understanding their own knowledge needs and gain necessary knowledge through knowledge sharing activities. In pre-Industry 4.0 organizations, this is done primarily through meetings. Originally developed to create smart meetings in smart factories, an elaborated version of the MEET model (Gullander et al, 2014) is used in this paper to evaluate the needs for sharing of tacit and explicit knowledge, both in regards to how it affects the Information System and the Organization System. By adding a systematic process approach to mapping individual knowledge needs related to production activities, these needs can be identified for each process step. By using this systematic approach to apply the MEET model, two Swedish SMEs within the manufacturing industry have developed their knowledge sharing activities. This human-centred study, based on questionnaires and interviews, focuses on how shop-floor operators perceive changes in knowledge sharing activities due to the use of the MEET model. Novelty in this research lies in the attempt to link the technology-intensive Industry 4.0 development with an organizational emphasis. Results show that the applied method can be used to pragmatically improve knowledge sharing from certain aspects, but further research is required to determine the correlation between different areas and their effect on knowledge sharing.

In the framework of Industry 5.0, humans are working alongside cobots to accomplish the required level of automation. However, human-robot interaction has brought up concerns regarding human factors (HF) and ergonomics. A human worker may experience cognitive stress as a result of cobots' irresponsive nature in unpredictably occurring situations, which adversely affects productivity. Therefore, there is a necessity to measure stress to enhance a human worker's performance in a human-robot collaborative environment. In this study, factory workers' mental workload was assessed using physiological, behavioural, and subjective measures. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were collected to acquire brain signals and track hemodynamic activity, respectively. The effect of task complexity, cobot movement speed, and cobot payload capacity on the mental stress of a human worker were observed for a task designed in the context of a smart factory. Task complexity and cobot speed proved to be more impactful. As physiological measures are unbiased and more authentic means to estimate stress, eventually they may replace the other conventional measures if they prove to correlate with the results of traditional ones. Here, regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were utilised to determine the correlation between physiological data and subjective and behavioural measures. Regression performed better for most of the targets and the best correlation (rsq-adj = 0.654146) was achieved for predicting missed beeps, a behavioural measure, using a combination of multiple EEG and fNIRS predictors.

Research on system performance has focused on enhancing vehicle automation and some work has evaluated cognitive workload for existing UAV interfaces. The potential for usable interface design to reduce cognitive workload during the early design phase has been largely overlooked. This study addresses these gaps by: (1) evaluating the effectiveness of a contemporary UAV interface design tool (the Modified GEDIS-UAV) to moderate user workload; (2) examining the effectiveness of various UAV interface designs for minimizing cognitive workload under different control task pacing; and (3) exploring the use of eye tracking measures, traditionally applied in other domains, as indicators of cognitive workload in UAV operations. We prototyped three different interface designs, classified as baseline, enhanced and degraded interfaces. Cognitive workload in UAV operation was manipulated in terms of levels of vehicle speed (low and high). Physiological and subjective measures of workload were collected for all combinations of interface design and task demand. Results revealed the enhanced interface to yield the lowest operator cognitive workload and supported operator resilience to increased control task demand, as compared to the baseline and degraded interfaces. In addition, task demand was found to elevate operator cognitive workload, particularly in terms of mental and temporal demands and operator perceptions of performance. The study also demonstrated utility of eye-tracking technology for detecting cognitive workload in UAV operations. This research provides practical guidance for UAV control interface design to manage operator workload. The methods employed in the study are applicable to interface evaluation for various types of UAVs and other unmanned systems to enhance human- automation interaction.","[Zhang, Wenjuan; Kaber, David B.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 111 Lampe Dr, Room 400, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Liu, Yunmei] Univ Louisville, Dept Ind Engn, 132 Eastern Pkey, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Zhang, Wenjuan] Dataminr Inc, 135 Madison Ave Floor 10, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Kaber, David B.] Univ Florida, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 303 Weil Hall,POB 116 595, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",North Carolina State University; University of Louisville; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Kaber, DB (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 111 Lampe Dr, Room 400, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA.;Kaber, DB (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 303 Weil Hall,POB 116 595, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",dkaber@ufl.edu,,"Kaber, David/0000-0003-3413-1503; Liu, Yunmei/0000-0002-6045-7614",National Aero-nautics and Space Administration (NASA) [NNX16AB23A],National Aero-nautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),Funding This research was supported by a grant from the National Aero-nautics and Space Administration (NASA Grant No. NNX16AB23A) .

Adaptive automation could potentially address this issue, but to do so it needs to be aware of real-time changes in operators' spare cognitive capacity, so it can provide help in times of peak demand and take advantage of troughs to elicit operator engagement. However, it is unclear whether rapid changes in task demands are reflected in similarly rapid fluctuations in spare capacity, and if so what aspects of responses to those demands are predictive of the current level of spare capacity. We used the ISO standard detection response task (DRT) to measure cognitive workload approximately every 4 s in a demanding task requiring monitoring and refueling of a fleet of simulated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We showed that the DRT provided a valid measure that can detect differences in workload due to changes in the number of UAVs. We used cross-validation to assess whether measures related to task performance immediately preceding the DRT could predict detection performance as a proxy for cognitive workload. Although the simple occurrence of task events had weak predictive ability, composite measures that tapped operators' situational awareness with respect to fuel levels were much more effective. We conclude that cognitive workload does vary rapidly as a function of recent task events, and that real-time predictive models of operators' cognitive workload provide a potential avenue for automation to adapt without an ongoing need for intrusive workload measurements.","[Boehm, Udo; Matzke, Dora] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, POB 15906, NL-1001 NK Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gretton, Matthew; Heathcote, Andrew] Univ Tasmania, Dept Psychol, Sandy Bay, Australia; [Castro, Spencer; Cooper, Joel; Strayer, David] Univ Utah, Dept Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Skinner, Michael] Def Sci & Technol Grp, Aerosp Div, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Amsterdam; University of Tasmania; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Defence Science & Technology,"Boehm, U (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, POB 15906, NL-1001 NK Amsterdam, Netherlands.",u.bohm@uva.nl,"Strayer, David/D-1586-2013; Castro, Spencer/V-6532-2019; Heathcote, Andrew/HZL-0286-2023; Cooper, Joel/E-9160-2010","Castro, Spencer/0000-0003-1394-0184; Boehm, Udo/0000-0002-8677-0721",Competitive Evaluation Research Agreement (CERA); Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO) [451-15010],Competitive Evaluation Research Agreement (CERA); Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This research was supported by Competitive Evaluation Research Agreement (CERA) grant to AH, DM, DS and MS.

Background: Autonomous vehicle systems are being implemented into the vehicle fleet. However, limited research exists in understanding the carryover effects of long-term exposure. Methods: Forty-eight participants (30 treatment, 18 control) completed eight drives across three separate days in a driving simulator. The treatment group had an intervention and withdrawal of a lane keeping system. Changes in driving performance (standard deviation of lateral position [SDLP] and mean time to collision [TTC]) and cognitive workload (response time and miss rate to a detection response task) were modeled using mixed effects linear and negative binomial regression. Results: Drivers exposed to the lane keeping system had an increase in SDLP after the system was withdrawn relative to their baseline. Drivers with lane keeping had decreased mean TTC during and after system withdrawal compared with manual drivers. There was an increase in cognitive workload when the lane keeping system was withdrawn relative to when the system was engaged. Conclusion: Behavioral adaptations in driving performance and cognitive workload were present during automation and persisted after the automation was withdrawn. Application: The findings of this research emphasize the importance to consider the effects of skill atrophy and misplaced trust due to semi-autonomous vehicle systems.

Little is known about differences in drivers' arousal and cognitive demands under partial automation and how it may make it difficult for drivers to transition from automated to manual modes. This research examined whether there are differences in drivers' arousal and cognitive demands during manual versus partial automation driving. Method We compared arousal (using heart rate) and cognitive demands (using the root mean square of successive differences in normal heartbeats; RMSSD, and Detection Response Task; DRT) while 39 younger (M = 28.82 years) and 32 late-middle-aged (M = 52.72 years) participants drove four partially automated vehicles (Cadillac, Nissan Rogue, Tesla, and Volvo) on interstate highways. If compared to manual driving, drivers' arousal and cognitive demands were different under partial automation, then corresponding differences in heart rate, RMSSD, and DRT would be expected. Alternatively, if drivers' arousal and cognitive demands were similar in manual and partially automated driving, no difference in the two driving modes would be expected. Results Results suggest no significant differences in heart rate, RMSSD, or DRT reaction time performance between manual and partially automated modes of driving for either younger or late-middle-aged adults across the four test vehicles. A Bayes Factor analysis suggested that heart rate, RMSSD, and DRT data showed extreme evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Conclusion This novel study conducted on real roads with a representative sample provides important evidence of no difference in arousal and cognitive demands. Younger and late-middle-aged motorists who are new to partial automation are able to maintain arousal and cognitive demands comparable to manual driving while using the partially automated technology. Drivers who are more experienced with partially automated technology may respond differently than those with limited prior experience.","[Lohani, Monika] Univ Utah, Dept Educ Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Cooper, Joel M.; Erickson, Gus G.; Simmons, Trent G.; McDonnell, Amy S.; Carriero, Amanda E.; Crabtree, Kaedyn W.; Strayer, David L.] Univ Utah, Dept Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Lohani, M (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Educ Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",Monika.Lohani@utah.edu,"Cooper, Joel/E-9160-2010; Strayer, David/D-1586-2013; Lohani, Mohtashim/AAR-3394-2021","Lohani, Monika/0000-0003-1927-9008",AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,Support for this work was provided by a grant from AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.,,68,9,12,2,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

Automated vehicles are expected to improve traffic safety. However, there are still some concerns about the effects of automation failures on driver performance and workload. Twenty-eight drivers participated in a driving simulation study. The findings suggested that drivers require at least 8 s of TOTB to safely take over the control of the vehicle. In addition, drivers exhibited safer takeover performance under the conditionally automated driving situation than negotiating the critical incident in the manual driving condition. The results of drivers' cognitive workload were inconclusive, which might be due to the individual and recall biases in subjective measures that could not capture subtle differences in workload during takeover requests. Practitioner Summary: A driving simulation study was conducted to assess the effect of unreliable automation, non-driving related tasks, and different takeover time budgets on drivers' performance and workload.

Currently, monitoring systems are used for independent assessment of human factors. However, the rise of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) has provided the framework for synchronizing multiple operator well-being assessments to create a comprehensive understanding of the operator's performance and health. Within manufacturing, an operator's dynamic well-being can be attributed to their physical and cognitive fatigue across the assembly process. As such, we apply non-invasive video understanding techniques to extract relevant assembly process information for automatic physical fatigue assessment. Our novelty involves a video-based fatigue estimation method, in which the boundary-aware dual-stream MS-TCN combined with an LSTM is proposed to detect the operation type, operation repetitions, and the target arm performing each task in an assembly process video. The detected results are then input into our physical fatigue profile to automatically assess the operator's localized physical fatigue impact. The assembly process of a real-world bookshelf is recorded and tested against, with our algorithm results showing superiority in operation segmentation and target arm detection as opposed to other recent action segmentation models. In addition, we integrate a cognitive fatigue assessment tool that captures operator physiological signals in real-time for body response detection caused by stress. This provides a more robust HDT of the operator for an HHRC system.","[Chand, Saahil; Zheng, Hao; Lu, Yuqian] Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Lu, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.",yuqian.lu@auckland.ac.nz,,,University of Auckland FRDF New Staff Research Fund [3720540],University of Auckland FRDF New Staff Research Fund,This study is supported by grants from the University of Auckland FRDF New Staff Research Fund (3720540) .,,37,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0278-6125,1878-6642,,J MANUF SYST,J.

This generally implies an unsustainable cognitive workload for the human operators, in addition to a non-negligible training effort. To overcome this issue, in this paper we present a methodology for the design of adaptive human-centred HMIs for industrial machines and robots. The proposed approach relies on three pillars: measurement of user's capabilities, adaptation of the information presented in the HMI, and training of the user.

In this study, 30 Ontario drivers operated a vehicle in manual and partially-automated mode. Cognitive workload was measured by means of the Detection Response Task, and visual attention was measured by means of coding glances on and off the forward roadway. No difference in cognitive workload was found between driving modes. However, drivers spent less time glancing at the forward roadway, and more time glancing at the vehicle's touchscreen. These data add to our knowledge of how vehicle automation affects cognitive workload and attention allocation, and show potential safety risks associated with the adoption of partially-automated driving.","[Biondi, Francesco N.; Jajo, Noor] Univ Windsor, Human Syst Lab, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Biondi, Francesco N.] Univ Utah, Appl Cognit Lab, Salt Lake City, UT USA",University of Windsor; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Biondi, FN (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Human Syst Lab, Windsor, ON, Canada.",francesco.biondi@uwindsor.ca,,,"Ontario Ministry of Transportation, Canada's Social Science and Humanities Research Council; National Science and Engineering Research Council","Ontario Ministry of Transportation, Canada's Social Science and Humanities Research Council; National Science and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","We thank the Ontario Ministry of Transportation, Canada's Social Science and Humanities Research Council and National Science and Engineering Research Council for their support to this research.",,42,0,0,14,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0001-4575,1879-2057,,ACCIDENT ANAL PREV,Accid.

This research investigated how deploying a user interface utilizing a 2-D and 3-D display affects participants' cognitive effort, task performance, trust, and situational awareness while performing a collaborative task using a robot. The study used a within-subject design where fifteen participants were subjected to three conditions: no interface, display User Interface, and mixed reality User Interface where vision assistance was provided. Participants performed a pick-and-place task with a robot in each condition under two levels of cognitive workload (i.e., high and low). The cognitive workload was measured using subjective (i.e., NASA TLX) and objective measures (i.e., heart rate variability). Additionally, task performance, situation awareness, and trust when using these interfaces were measured to understand the impact of different user interfaces during a Human-Robot Collaboration task. Findings from this study indicated that cognitive workload and user interfaces impacted task performance, where a significant decrease in efficiency and accuracy was observed while using the mixed reality interface. Additionally, irrespective of the three conditions, all participants perceived the task as more cognitively demanding during the high cognitive workload session. However, no signifcant differences across the interfaces were observed. Finally, cognitive workload impacted situational awareness and trust, where lower levels were reported in the high cognitive workload session, and the lowest levels were observed under the mixed reality user interface condition.","[Kalatzis, Apostolos; Rahman, Saidur; Stanley, Laura; Wittie, Mike] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Prabhu, Vishnunarayan Girishan] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Kalatzis, A (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",apostoloskalatzis@smontana.edu; vgirisha@charlotte.edu; saidurrahman@montana.edu; Laura.stanley@montana.edu; mike.wittie@montana.edu,"Girishan Prabhu, Vishnunarayan/AAE-5876-2021","Girishan Prabhu, Vishnunarayan/0000-0001-5410-9894; Wittie, Mike/0000-0002-3752-2430; Kalatzis, Apostolos/0000-0002-1519-2207",National Science Foundation [1900704],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Science Foundation under award number 1900704.,,87,0,0,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0055-2,,,,2023,,,,,,,5,14,,10.1145/3577190.3614112,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3577190.3614112,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW4GP,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:001147764700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

While individual task performance of the robotic assistance and human operator can be separately optimized, the interaction between humans and robots can lead to emergent effects on collaborative performance. Thus, the performance benefits of increased automation in robotic assistance and its impact by human factors need to be considered. As such, this letter examines the interplay of operator sex, their cognitive fatigue states, and varying levels of automation on collaborative task performance, operator situation awareness and perceived workload, and physiological responses (heart rate variability; HRV). Sixteen participants, balanced by sex, performed metal polishing tasks directly with a UR10 collaborative robot under different fatigued states and with varying levels of robotic assistance. Perceived fatigue, situation awareness, and workload were measured periodically, in addition to continuous physiological monitoring and three task performance metrics: task efficiency, accuracy, and precision, were obtained. Higher robotic assistance demonstrated direct task performance benefits. However, unlike females, males did not perceive the performance benefits as better with higher automation. A relationship between situation awareness and automation was observed in both the HRV signals and subjective measures, where increased robot assistance reduced the attentional supply and task engagement of participants. The consideration of the interplay between human factors, such as operator sex and their cognitive states, and robot factors on collaborative performance can lead to improved human-robot collaborative system designs.","[Hopko, S.

Most industrial accidents occur today due to human error. For safe and efficient operation, it is therefore critical to ensure optimal operator performance. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and concomitant digitalization, the role of operators has become cognitively challenging. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the cognitive performance of operators. One of the major constructs to understand cognitive performance is the cognitive workload. An increase in cognitive workload often leads to degradation in performance. Traditional assessment techniques fail to capture cognitive aspects of performance. Recently, researchers in various domains such as aviation, driving, marine, and nuclear power have started to utilize physiological measures to gauge the cognitive workload of their operators. In our previous works, we have used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking separately to assess the cognitive workload of operators in the process industries. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the benefits of their fusion in classifying process industry control room operators' workload into low, medium, and high classes while they tackle abnormal situations. The methodology employs the fusion of metrics derived from pupil, gaze, and EEG data to train a decision tree-based model for workload classification. Our results reveal that fusion leads to an increase in classification accuracy of upto 22 %. The work has the potential to identify the expertise level of operators and hence, can be critical in ensuring their optimal performance.","[Iqbal, Mohd Umair] Indian Inst Technol Gandhinagar, Dept Chem Engn, Gandhinagar 382355, India; [Srinivasan, Babji] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Appl Mech, Chennai 600036, India; [Iqbal, Mohd Umair; Srinivasan, Rajagopalan] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Chem Engn, Chennai 600036, India; [Srinivasan, Babji; Srinivasan, Rajagopalan] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Amer Express Lab Data Analyt Risk & Technol, Chennai 600036, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras,"Srinivasan, B; Srinivasan, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Amer Express Lab Data Analyt Risk & Technol, Chennai 600036, India.",babji.srinivasan@iitm.ac.in; raj@iitm.ac.in,"Srinivasan, Rajagopalan/B-5322-2010","Srinivasan, Rajagopalan/0000-0002-8790-4349","American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","This work is partially funded by the American Express Lab for Data Analytics, Risk and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 600036, India.",,81,4,4,9,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0098-1354,1873-4375,,COMPUT CHEM ENG,Comput.

While using automated systems (e.g., self-driving cars, autopilot), operators (e.g., drivers, pilots, soldiers) visually monitor displays for critical changes, making deficits in the accommodative and/or vergence responses potentially hazardous for individuals remaining actively engaged in the task at hand. The purpose of this study was to determine if symptoms of accommodative-vergence deficits predict an individual's level of task engagement and cognitive fatigue while performing a flight simulation task with or without automation. Eighty-four participants performed a flight simulation task with or without automation. Prior to task completion, self-report accommodative-convergence deficit symptoms were assessed with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS). Before and after the flight simulation task participants rated their task engagement and cognitive fatigue. Electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was recorded concurrently during task performance. Results showed that higher scores on the CISS were related to increased feelings of fatigue and decreased ratings of task engagement. The CISS was also positively related to parietal-occipital fast alpha power during the last 10 min of the task for participants using automation, suggesting increased cortical idling. CISS scores did not predict performance. Results have implications for optimizing operator cognitive states over extended task performance.","[Bernhardt, Kyle A.; Poltavski, Dmitri] Univ North Dakota, Dept Psychol, 501 North Columbia Rd,Stop 8380, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Bernhardt, KA (corresponding author), Univ North Dakota, 501 North Columbia Rd,Stop 8380, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",kyle.bernhardt@und.edu; dmitri.poltavski@und.edu,,,,,,,64,8,9,2,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines.

Background Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. Method Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. Results Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by then-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. Conclusion This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times. Application Results are applicable to the assessment of the effects of high cognitive workload in manufacturing.","[Biondi, Francesco N.; Cacanindin, Angela; Cort, Joel] Univ Windsor, Dept Kinesiol, 2555 Coll Ave, Winsdor, ON, Canada; [Douglas, Caitlyn] Univ Windsor, Winsdor, ON, Canada; [Biondi, Francesco N.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA",University of Windsor; University of Windsor; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Biondi, FN (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Kinesiol, 2555 Coll Ave, Winsdor, ON, Canada.",francesco.biondi@uwindsor.ca,"biondi, francesco/B-4512-2013","Biondi, Francesco N./0000-0002-5558-4707",University of Windsor-SSHRC Explore program; Mitacs,University of Windsor-SSHRC Explore program; Mitacs,The authors acknowledge the collaboration of the personnel at the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Windsor and the funding from the University of Windsor-SSHRC Explore program and Mitacs.,,30,32,36,4,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

An excessive workload can lead to fatigue or accidents, while an insufficient workload may diminish situational awareness and efficiency. However, existing supervised learning-based methods for workload recognition are ineffective when dealing with imperfect input data, such as missing or noisy data, which is not practical in real applications. This study introduces a robust Electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled cognitive workload recognition model using self-supervised learning. The proposed method, DMAEEG, combines the training strategies of denoising autoencoders and masked autoencoders, demonstrating strong robustness against noisy and incomplete data. More specifically, we adopt the temporal convolutional network and multi-head self- attention mechanisms as the backbone, effectively capturing both the temporal and spatial features from EEG. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on an open dataset and a self-collected dataset. The results indicate that DMAEEG performs superior to other state-of-the-art across various evaluation metrics. Moreover, DMAEEG maintains high accuracy in workload inference even when EEG signals are corrupted with a high masking ratio or strong noises. This signifies its superiority in capturing robust intrinsic patterns from imperfect EEG data. The proposed method significantly contributes to decoding EEG signals for workload recognition in real-world applications, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of human-automation interactions.","[Yu, Xiaoqing; Chen, Chun-Hsien] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Chen, CH (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",XIAOQING003@e.ntu.edu.sg; mchchen@ntu.edu.sg,"Yu, Xiaoqing/E-2388-2013; Chen, Chun-Hsien/A-3877-2011","Chen, Chun-Hsien/0000-0003-2193-5270; Yu, Xiaoqing/0009-0006-7451-6204","National Research Foundation, Singapore; Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore; [REQ0532039_FAA_Vertical]","National Research Foundation, Singapore(National Research Foundation, Singapore); Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore;","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore, and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, under the Aviation Transformation Programme.

Due to its high time resolution and convenient acquisition, Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely applied in brain monitoring and cognitive state assessment. In this study, a multi-scale Swin Transformer network (MST-Net) was proposed for cognitive load assessment, which extracts local features with different sensory fields using a multi-scale parallel convolution model and introduces the attention mechanism of the Swin Transformer to obtain the feature correlations among multi-scale local features. The performance of the proposed network was validated using the EEG signals collected during cognitive tasks and N-back tasks with three different load levels. Results show that the MST-Net network achieved the best classification accuracy on both local and public datasets, and was higher than the mainstream Swin Transformer and CNN. Furthermore, results of ablation experiments and feature visualization revealed that the proposed MSTNet could well characterize different cognitive loads, which not only provided novel and powerful tools for cognitive load assessment but also showed potential for broad application in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.","[Li, Zhongrui; Zhang, Rongkai; Zeng, Ying; Tong, Li; Lu, Runnan; Yan, Bin] PLA Strateg Support Force Informat Engn Univ, Henan Key Lab Imaging & Intelligent Proc, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",PLA Information Engineering University,"Yan, B (corresponding author), PLA Strateg Support Force Informat Engn Univ, Henan Key Lab Imaging & Intelligent Proc, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China.",lzr_jsjtx@163.com,"RongKai, Zhang/ABA-3594-2021; Yan, Bin/Y-7642-2019",,STI [2022ZD0208500]; National Natural Science Foundation China [62106285],STI; National Natural Science Foundation China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by STI 2030-Major Projects 2022ZD0208500, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation China under Grant 62106285.",,35,1,1,23,53,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0361-9230,1873-2747,,BRAIN RES BULL,Brain Res.

We present a model-based approach for online simulation and assessment of cognitive workload, based on analysing the activities of a cognitive architecture during simulation. A driving simulator experiment was used to evaluate the approach. The cognitive workload of participants was manipulated with a variant of the n-back task as secondary task that parametrically varies memory workload. A virtual driver model was created using the cognitive architecture. The model was simulated in the same situations as the human drivers. The activities of the cognitive architecture as indicator of cognitive workload increased with increasing difficulty of the n-back task. To relate model workload to human driver workload, we compared it with neurophysiological workload measures based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain activation as a complementary measure.","[Wortelen, Bertram; Unni, Anirudh; Rieger, Jochem W.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Psychol, Oldenburg, Germany; [Luedtke, Andreas] OFFIS, Inst Informat Technol, Human Ctr Design, Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Wortelen, B (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Psychol, Oldenburg, Germany.",bertram.wortelen1@uol.de; anirudh.unni@uol.de; jochem.rieger@uol.de; luedtke@offis.de,,"Rieger, Jochem/0000-0003-0955-2306; Wortelen, Bertram/0000-0002-3597-2366",Volkswagen Foundation and the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony as a part of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Critical Systems Engineering,Volkswagen Foundation and the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony as a part of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Critical Systems Engineering,This work was supported by the funding initiative Niedersachsisches Vorab of the Volkswagen Foundation and the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony as a part of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Critical Systems Engineering for Socio-Technical Systems.,,22,12,13,0,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2375-1312,,978-1-5090-2645-6,INT CONF COGN INFO,,,2016,,,,,,,11,16,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Telecommunications,BG8OD,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000392535000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies indicate that sub-optimal decisions occur when there is a mismatch between the demands of the process and the human's capability. This mismatch leads to high cognitive workload in human operators, often a precursor for poor performance. Recently, researchers in various safety critical domains (aviation, driving, marine, NPP, etc.) have started to explore the use of physiological measurements from humans to understand their cognitive workload and its effect. In this work, we evaluate the potential of EEG to measure cognitive workload of human operators in chemical process control room. We propose a single dry electrode EEG based methodology for identifying the similarities and mismatch between the operators' mental model of the process and the actual process behaviour during abnormal situations. Our results reveal that S-theta(omega), the power spectral density of theta (theta) waves (frequency range 4-7 Hz) in the EEG signal has the potential to identify such mismatches. Results indicate that S-theta(omega) is positively correlated with workload and hence can be used for assessing the cognitive workload of operators in process industries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially in industrial environments, a strong level of interaction is reached when humans and robots form a dynamic system that works together towards achieving a common goal or accomplishing a task. However, the human-robot collaboration can be cognitively demanding, potentially contributing to cognitive fatigue. Therefore, the consideration of cognitive fatigue becomes particularly important to ensure the efficiency and safety in the overall human-robot collaboration. Additionally, sex is an inevitable human factor that needs further investigation for machine learning model development given the perceptual and physiological differences between the sexes in responding to fatigue. As such, this study explored sex differences and labeling strategies in the development of machine learning models for cognitive fatigue detection. Sixteen participants, balanced by sex, recruited to perform a surface finishing task with a UR10 collaborative robot under fatigued and non-fatigued states. Fatigue perception and heart rate activity data collected throughout to create a dataset for cognitive fatigue detection. Equitable machine learning models developed based on perception (survey responses) and condition (fatigue manipulation). The labeling approach had a significant impact on the accuracy and F1-score, where perception-based labels lead to lower accuracy and F1-score for females likely due to sex differences in reporting of fatigue. Additionally, we observed a relationship between heart rate, algorithm type, and labeling approach, where heart rate was the most significant predictor for the two labeling approaches and for all the algorithms utilized. Understanding the implications of label type, algorithm type, and sex on the design of fatigue detection algorithms is essential to designing equitable fatigue-adaptive human-robot collaborations across the sexes.","[Kalatzis, Apostolos; Stanley, Laura; Wittie, Mike P.] Montana State Univ, Gianforte Sch Comp, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Hopko, Sarah; Mehta, Ranjana K.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Kalatzis, A (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Gianforte Sch Comp, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",,"Mehta, Ranjana/AAE-3257-2020","Kalatzis, Apostolos/0000-0002-1519-2207",,,,,39,2,2,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-0858,,978-1-6654-7927-1,IEEE INT C INT ROBOT,,,2022,,,,,,,10951,10958,,10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981097,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981097,,,8,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BU4YE,,Green Published,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000909405303007,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.","[Hopko, Sarah K.; Mehta, Ranjana K.] Texas A&M Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Mehta, Ranjana K.; Pagilla, Prabhakar R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Mech Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Mehta, RK (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",rmehta@tamu.edu,"Mehta, Ranjana/AAE-3257-2020","Hopko, Sarah/0000-0003-4713-4455; Mehta, Ranjana/0000-0002-8254-8365",National Science Foundation [1900704],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1900704 (Augmenting Human Cognition with Collaborative Robots).,,66,15,15,8,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

Operators are vulnerable to cognitive overload, despite support from system automation. This study tested whether attentional resource theory predicts impacts of cognitive demands on performance measures, including automation-dependence and stress. It also investigated individual differences in response to demands. One-hundred and 1 university student participants performed a multi-UAS simulation mission incorporating 2 surveillance tasks. Cognitive demands and level of automation (LOA) of key tasks were manipulated between-subjects. Results were partially consistent with predictions. Higher task demands impaired performance and elevated distress and workload, as expected. Higher LOA produced greater dependence on automation, but failed to mitigate workload. It was expected that, as the automation was quite reliable, participants would attempt to conserve resources by depending more on automation under high demand. In fact, the opposite tendency was observed. Individuals high in conscientiousness were especially likely to override the automation under high demand, apparently taking charge personally. Neuroticism and distress were also associated with performance, but results did not fit a resource theory interpretation. Thus, understanding impacts of overload in the multi-UAS context requires understanding operator strategy as well as resource insufficiency. Findings have implications for system design. and operator selection and training.","[Lin, Jinchao; Matthews, Gerald; Wohleber, Ryan W.] Univ Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, 3100 Technol Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32826 USA; [Funke, Gregory J.; Calhoun, Gloria L.] Air Force Res Lab, Wright Patterson AFB, OH USA; [Ruff, Heath A.] Infoscitex, Dayton, OH USA; [Szalma, James] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Psychol, Orlando, FL 32826 USA; [Chiu, Peter] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Psychol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; US Air Force Research Laboratory; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Matthews, G (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, 3100 Technol Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32826 USA.",gmatthews@ist.ucf.edu,"Funke, Gregory/R-5021-2019",,"AFOSR [A9550-13-1-0016, 13RH05COR]",AFOSR(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)),"This research was sponsored by AFOSR A9550-13-1-0016 and 13RH05COR.

The success of present and future autonomous technology in exploration spaceflight is ultimately dependent upon safe and efficient interaction with the human operator. Optimal interaction is particularly important for surface missions during highly coordinated extravehicular activity (EVA), which consists of high physical and cognitive demands with limited ground support. Crew functional state may be affected by a number of variables including workload, stress, and motivation. Real-time assessments of crew state that do not require a crewmember's time and attention to complete will be especially important to assess operational performance and behavioral health during flight. In response to the need for objective, passive assessment of crew state, the aim of this work is to develop an accurate and precise prediction model of human functional state for surface EVA using multi-modal psychophysiological sensing. The psychophysiological monitoring approach relies on extracting a set of features from physiological signals and using these features to classify an operator's cognitive state. This work aims to compile a non-invasive sensor suite to collect physiological data in real-time. Training data during cognitive and more complex functional tasks will be used to develop a classifier to discriminate high and low cognitive workload crew states. The classifier will then be tested in an operationally relevant EVA simulation to predict cognitive workload over time. Once a crew state is determined, further research into specific countermeasures, such as decision support systems, would be necessary to optimize the automation and improve crew state and operational performance.","[Wusk, Grace C.; Gabler, Hampton C.] Virgina Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Abercromby, Andrew F.] NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Houston, TX USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"Wusk, GC (corresponding author), Virgina Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",gracew@vt.edu; andrew.f.abercromby@nasa.gov; gabler@vt.edu,"Gabler, Hampton/C-1758-2012",,NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship,NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship,This work was supported by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship.,,14,2,3,0,8,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-6869-8,,,,2019,,,,,,,404,407,,10.1145/3341162.3349309,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3341162.3349309,,,4,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BO1MK,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000501543800104,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous work has outlined the complexity of an assembly worker's situation both in terms of difficulty and speed of work and there have been a few attempts at creating frameworks and methods for understanding the key aspects of what creates increased cognitive load. This paper presents the development of an analytic method, denoted CLAM (Cognitive Load Assessment for Manufacturing), and a tool for assessing cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly. It outlines the journey of the development as well as discusses and problematizes relevant meta-methodological issues paired with method development. The intended contribution of the work is to make a difference in reducing the cognitive load of assembly workers on the shop floor, thus focusing the development on applicability and usability of the tool in practice. With this purpose in mind, focus of the method development has been on the practitioners, i.e. the method should not require any expert knowledge to be applied. The CLAM method and accompanying documentation such as a handbook containing instructions towards using the method and interpreting the results, is available in an online tool.","[Thorvald, Peter] Univ Skovde, Sch Engn Sci, Box 408, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden; [Lindblom, Jessica] Univ Skovde, Sch Informat, Box 408, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden; [Andreasson, Rebecca] Uppsala Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Box 337, S-75105 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Skovde; University of Skovde; Uppsala University,"Thorvald, P (corresponding author), Univ Skovde, Sch Engn Sci, Box 408, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden.",peter.thorvald@his.se,"Cort, Rebecca/AAE-8618-2020; Lindblom, Jessica/GWD-0497-2022; Thorvald, Peter/C-3143-2012","Thorvald, Peter/0000-0002-8369-5471; Lindblom, Jessica/0000-0003-0946-7531",EU [FP7-314350],EU(European Union (EU)),"This work has been carried out through the Sense&React project, funded by the EU Grant FP7-314350.

This increase in automation has led to new supervisory roles for human operators where humans monitor feedback from autonomous systems and provide input when necessary. Optimizing these roles requires tools for evaluation of task complexity and resulting operator cognitive workload. Cognitive task analysis is a process for modeling the cognitive actions required of a human during a task. This work presents an enhanced version of this process: Cognitive Task Analysis and Workload Classification (CTAWC). The goal of developing CTAWC was to provide a standardized process to decompose cognitive tasks in enough depth to allow for precise identification of sources of cognitive workload. CTAWC has the following advantages over conventional CTA methodology: center dot Integrates standard terminology from existing taxonomies for task classification to describe expected operator cognitive workload during task performance. center dot Provides a framework to evaluate adequate cognitive depth when decomposing cognitive tasks. center dot Provides a standard model upon which to build an empirical study to evaluate task complexity.

Periods of low cognitive workload may be followed by periods of high cognitive workload and vice versa. During such changing demands, there exists potential for increased error on behalf of the pilots due to periods of boredom or excessive cognitive task demand. To further understand cognitive workload in aviation, the present study involved collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) data from ten (10) collegiate aviation students in a live-flight environment in a single-engine aircraft. Each pilot possessed a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate and either FAA class I or class II medical certificate. Each pilot flew a standardized flight profile representing an average instrument flight training sequence. For data analysis, we used four main sub-bands of the recorded EEG signals: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Power spectral density (PSD) and log energy entropy of each sub-band across 20 electrodes were computed and subjected to two feature selection algorithms (recursive feature elimination (RFE) and lasso cross-validation (LassoCV), and a stacking ensemble machine learning algorithm composed of support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression. Also, hyperparameter optimization and tenfold cross-validation were used to improve the model performance, reliability, and generalization. The feature selection step resulted in 15 features that can be considered an indicator of pilots' cognitive workload states. Then these features were applied to the stacking ensemble algorithm, and the highest results were achieved using the selected features by the RFE algorithm with an accuracy of 91.67% (+/- 0.11), a precision of 93.89% (+/- 0.09), recall of 91.67% (+/- 0.11), F-score of 91.22% (+/- 0.12), and the mean ROC-AUC of 0.93 (+/- 0.06). The achieved results indicated that the combination of PSD and log energy entropy, along with well-designed machine learning algorithms, suggest the potential for the use of EEG to discriminate periods of the low, medium, and high workload to augment aircraft system design, including flight automation features to improve aviation safety.","[Gorji, Hamed Taheri; Hoffmann, Bradley; Tavakolian, Kouhyar] Univ North Dakota, Biomed Engn Program, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA; [Wilson, Nicholas] Univ North Dakota, Dept Aviat, Grand Forks, ND USA; [VanBree, Jessica; Petros, Thomas] Univ North Dakota, Dept Psychol, Grand Forks, ND USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks; University of North Dakota Grand Forks; University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Gorji, HT (corresponding author), Univ North Dakota, Biomed Engn Program, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",hamed.taherigorji@und.edu,,"Wilson, Nicholas/0000-0003-4627-1140",John D.

For this reason, it has been widely embraced in various industrial fields, especially for helping operators assemble products. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a debate in the research community about how effective AR is for improving user performance in assembly tasks, particularly when using handheld devices. These disparities can be attributed to differences in experimental approaches, such as the frequent use of qualitative methods, the inclusion of non -representative users, and the limited number of comprehensive case studies. In response to this, the paper delved into the benefits of AR applications, with a specific focus on measuring user performance and the cognitive workload perceived by users during assembly activities. To this end, an AR assembly guidance tool has been developed to assist users during assembly tasks, running on a mobile device, specifically a tablet, for freedom of movement and high portability. Experimentation involved the assembly of a comprehensive case study and a diverse user group, allowing the comparison representative users and experienced industrial operators. The results were promising, indicating that AR technology effectively enhances user performance during assembly-guided activities compared to conventional methods, particularly when users are unfamiliar with the task at hand. This study brings valuable insights by addressing previous research limitations and providing strong evidence of AR's positive impact on user performance in real -world assembly scenarios.","[Marino, Emanuele; Barbieri, Loris; Bruno, Fabio; Muzzupappa, Maurizio] Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn DIMEG, P Bucci 46C, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Calabria,"Marino, E (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn DIMEG, P Bucci 46C, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",emanuele.marino@unical.it,"Barbieri, Loris/AAH-1095-2021; Bruno, Fabio/KHZ-3513-2024","Marino, Emanuele/0000-0002-0887-1201; Barbieri, Loris/0000-0001-7771-6582",Italian MISE under the PON Imprese e Competitivi a program; [F/190084/03/X44-CUP: B21B19000530008COR: 1679960],Italian MISE under the PON Imprese e Competitivi a program;,"This research has been partially funded by the project SMILE, funded by the Italian MISE under the PON Imprese e Competitivit a program.

Augmented reality (AR) is one of these emerging technologies; it assists users with the help of virtual images on the real display of the work environment. Although AR benefits employees in terms of productivity and quality, it is not precisely known if it has a cognitive effect on the employees. In this study, the effect of AR glasses on the cognitive loads of the employees was investigated. The experiments were carried out on the assembly line of an automobile company. Electroencephalography (EEG) and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) were used to measure cognitive load. The current and AR-based work procedures were examined comparatively. Also, the difference between the cognitive load on the first and last days of experiments was compared to determine the adaptation status of the employees. The average of the area under the EEG graph as a measure of cognitive load, were 18.96 and 5.24 mu V*ms in employees working with and without AR glasses, respectively. NASA-TLX scores of the employees decreased by 10% when they work with AR glasses. So, there was a less cognitive load on employees in the case of using AR glasses. And there was no significant difference between the first and last days of device usage. Hence, AR glasses did not constitute an extra cognitive load from the first day of usage.","[Atici-Ulusu, Hilal; Gunduz, Tulin] Bursa Uludag Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Bursa, Turkey; [Ikiz, Yagmur Dila] Bursa Uludag Univ, Grad Sch Nat & Appl Sci, Ind Engn Program, Bursa, Turkey; [Taskapilioglu, Ozlem] Acibadem Hosp, Dept Neurol, Bursa, Turkey",Uludag University; Uludag University; Acibadem Hastaneleri,"Gunduz, T (corresponding author), Bursa Uludag Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Bursa, Turkey.",tg@uludag.edu.tr,"ULUSU, H?LAL/AAG-9842-2021; Gunduz, Tulin/AAG-8710-2021","OZDEMIR, YAGMUR DILA/0000-0003-0701-2111; Gunduz, Tulin/0000-0002-7134-3997",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [217M505],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This work was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey, with project number [217M505].",,43,24,24,10,64,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

Wheelchair control is a complex motor task that increases both the physical and cognitive workload. New wheelchair interfaces, including Power Assisted devices, can further augment users by reducing the required physical effort, however little is known on the mental effort implications. In this study, we adopted a neuroergonomic approach utilizing mobile and wireless functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based brain monitoring of physically active participants. 48 volunteers (30 novice and 18 experienced) self-propelled on a wheelchair with and without a PowerAssist interface in both simple and complex realistic environments. Results indicated that as expected, the complex more difficult environment led to lower task performance complemented by higher prefrontal cortex activity compared to the simple environment. The use of the PowerAssist feature had significantly lower brain activation compared to traditional manual control only for novices. Expertise led to a lower brain activation pattern within the middle frontal gyrus, complemented by performance metrics that involve lower cognitive workload. Results here confirm the potential of the Neuroergonomic approach and that direct neural activity measures can complement and enhance task performance metrics. We conclude that the cognitive workload benefits of PowerAssist are more directed to new users and difficult settings. The approach demonstrated here can be utilized in future studies to enable greater personalization and understanding of mobility interfaces within real-world dynamic environments.","[Joshi, Shawn; Ayaz, Hasan] Drexel Univ, Sch Biomed Engn Sci & Hlth Syst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Herrera, Roxana Ramirez; Ramirez, Dafne Zuleima Morgado; Holloway, Catherine] UCL, Comp Sci Dept, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Springett, Daniella Nicole; Weedon, Benjamin David; Dawes, Helen] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford Inst Nursing Midwifery & Allied Hlth Res, Oxford OX3 0BP, England",Drexel University; University of London; University College London; Oxford Brookes University,"Joshi, S (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Sch Biomed Engn Sci & Hlth Syst, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sj633@drexel.edu,"Ayaz, Hasan/A-3274-2008; Springett, Daniella/HNJ-5827-2023; Morgado Ramirez, Dafne Zuleima/D-3711-2016","Morgado Ramirez, Dafne Zuleima/0000-0002-0320-7301; Joshi, Shawn/0000-0002-7938-6393; Ayaz, Hasan/0000-0001-5514-2741; Weedon, Benjamin/0000-0001-6983-5119; Springett, Daniella/0000-0002-4478-827X",Adaptive Assistive Rehabilitative Technologies - Beyond the Clinic grant by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M025543/1]; Fulbright US-UK Fellowship; Elizabeth Casson Trust; NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre; National Council of Science and Technology in Mexico (CONACYT); EPSRC [EP/M025543/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Adaptive Assistive Rehabilitative Technologies - Beyond the Clinic grant by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Fulbright US-UK Fellowship; Elizabeth Casson Trust; NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre; National Council of Science and Technology in Mexico (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"Authors are grateful to Jamie Whitty, Joel Chappell, Ian Allen, and the research assistants Cyrus Goodger, Jessica Andrich, and JoJo Dawes.

The cognitive view of function allocation was also discussed. The broad scope of ergonomics led to the most transparent, predictable and controllable automation system design. Function allocation is an ergonomic method to decide whether a particular function will be accomplished by a human, by an automation system or by human-automation interaction. Investigation of the human nervous system from integrative perspective provides the better understanding of the basis of automation and designing a better function allocation. High cognitive demands in human-automation interface can also influence the function allocation in man-machine system.

As the sophistication of automation has increased, some traditional input devices in the cockpit, such as throttle levers, yokes, and switches, have unobtrusively changed the way they work. Instead of operating the same way at all times, the behavior of these input devices has become context-sensitive (i.e., moded). It is well known in human factors design that nonsalient moded input devices require increased cognitive workload and can result in a startle, surprise, and confusion. An analysis of modern airliner cockpits identified three types of moded input devices: 1) disabled, 2) alternative behavior, and 3) command override.

The high-level framework of the haptic take-over control system, which takes driver cognitive workload, neuromuscular dynamics and optimal trajectory planning into consideration, is developed. Under the proposed framework, the determination approach of the optimal input sequence is introduced. The model of the allowed driver take-over authority, which is associated with driver's cognitive workload, as well as muscle readiness during takeover, is investigated and developed. The haptic feedback torque controller is then designed so as to minimize the deviation between the allowed control authority and driver's current degree of participation. A handover process, along with the proposed take-over control method, is also simulated. The simulation results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","[Lv, Chen] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Lv, Chen] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Wang, Huaji] AVL Powertrain UK Ltd, Coventry CV4 7EZ, W Midlands, England; [Zhao, Yifan; Auger, Daniel J.; Brighton, James] Cranfield Univ, Sch Aerosp Transport & Mfg, Bedford MK43 0AL, England; [Cao, Dongpu] Univ Waterloo, Mech & Mechatron Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Sullman, Mark] Middle East Tech Univ, Kapouti, Cyprus; [Matthias, Rebecca; Skrypchuk, Lee; Mouzakitis, Alexandros] Jaguar Land Rover, Coventry CV3 4LF, W Midlands, England",Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Cranfield University; University of Waterloo; Jaguar Land Rover,"Lv, C (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;Lv, C (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",henrylvchen@gmail.com; Huaji.Wang@avl.com; dongp_ca@yahoo.com; yifan.zhao@cranfield.ac.uk; msullman@metu.edu.tr; d.j.auger@cranfield.ac.uk; j.l.brighton@cranfield.ac.uk; rmatthia@jaguarlandrover.com; lskrypch@jaguarlandrover.com; amouzakl@jaguarlandrover.com,"Zhao, Yifan/ADE-5116-2022; Auger, Daniel/IQV-7547-2023; Lv, Chen/N-7055-2018","Cao, Dongpu/0000-0003-2541-5272; Zhao, Yifan/0000-0003-2383-5724; Lv, Chen/0000-0001-6897-4512; Sullman, Mark/0000-0001-7920-6818",Jaguar Land Rover; UK-EPSRC [EP/N012089/1],Jaguar Land Rover; UK-EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This research was supported by Jaguar Land Rover and the UK-EPSRC grant EP/N012089/1 as part of the jointly funded Towards Autonomy: Smart and Connected Control (TASCC) Programme.,,19,13,16,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1931-0587,,978-1-5386-4452-2,IEEE INT VEH SYM,,,2018,,,,,,,1596,1601,,,,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics; Transportation Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Robotics; Transportation,BS4IK,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000719424500249,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a between-subject experiment was created to explore humans' perception towards robots by measuring their cognitive workload at three different human-robot collaboration levels of coexistence, cooperation, and collaboration when accomplishing a real-world bricklaying construction task. Results showed that collaborating with small ground robots may lead to lower physical demand compared to cooperating or simply coexisting with it.

However, when the EEG signals are recorded on different people, the accuracy of such a model could be impaired due to its incapability of fitting varied statistical distributions across different individuals. To this end, we propose an individual-independent workload estimator, a cascade ensemble of multilayer autoencoders to tackle the individual difference within the EEG features. It could assess the workload levels of an unseen subject by adapting the EEG data recorded from non-overlapped existing subjects. We first construct a deep stacked denoising autoencoder to abstract EEG features from a specific individual. Its shallow weights are optimized with individual-specific geometrical information of the features. Then, to find generalizable feature properties, we introduce Q-statistics to measure the independence between base learners. Finally, a regularized extreme learning machine is used as a cascade metaclassifier to fuse and filter high-level EEG abstractions and determine workload levels. We employ databases from two different experiments to validate our approach. The proposed framework can lead to acceptable accuracy and computational complexity compared to several existing workload classifiers.","[Zheng, Zhanpeng; Yin, Zhong; Wang, Yongxiong] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Engn Res Ctr Opt Instrument & Syst, Shanghai Key Lab Modern Opt Syst, Minist Educ, Jungong Rd 516, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianhua] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Opt Elect & Comp Engn, Jungong Rd 516, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianhua] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, OsloMet Artificial Intelligence Lab, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Yin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Engn Res Ctr Opt Instrument & Syst, Shanghai Key Lab Modern Opt Syst, Minist Educ, Jungong Rd 516, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.",182560473@st.usst.edu.cn; wyxiong@usst.edu.cn; jianhuaz@oslomet.no,,"Zheng, Zhanpeng/0000-0002-4168-3106",National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shanghai Sailing Program; National Nat- ural Science Foundation of China; [61703277]; [17YF1427000]; [61673276],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Sailing Program; National Nat- ural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ; ;,This work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61703277 and the Shanghai Sailing Program (17YF1427000) .

Automation fundamentally changes the nature of the cognitive demands placed on the human operator, while simultaneously increasing the potential for out-of-the-loop performance problems to impact system efficacy. As a novel human factors method for assessing these human-automation interaction-derived, out-of-the-loop, performance challenges, we introduce the Human-Automation Behavioral Interaction Task (HABIT) analysis. The HABIT framework considers the drivers of system performance in terms of both cognitive activity and human behavior. As an example, we apply HABIT to a tedious intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance task. HABIT demonstrates its effectiveness in guiding the modeling and annotation of cognitive activities and successfully predicting actions resulting in errors. System designers can apply HABIT to assess human-automation interaction before a system is fielded to proactively address and mitigate out-of-the-loop performance problems.","[Baird, Isabelle; Fendley, Mary E.] Wright State Univ, Dept Ind & Human Factors Engn, Ruston, LA USA; [Warren, Rik] Wright Patterson Air Force Res Lab, Wright Patterson AFB, OH USA",,"Fendley, ME (corresponding author), Louisiana Tech Univ, Ind Engn, 600 Dan Reneau Dr, Ruston, LA 71272 USA.",mfendley@latech.edu,"Fendley, Mary/JDD-1774-2023",,Air Force Research Laboratory/Defense Associated Student Innovators Award,Air Force Research Laboratory/Defense Associated Student Innovators Award,Air Force Research Laboratory/Defense Associated Student Innovators Award,,54,1,1,6,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-8471,1520-6564,,HUM FACTOR ERGON MAN,Hum.

The impact of preclinical AD on using automated vehicle (AV) technology is unknown. The aim was to evaluate safety and cognitive workload while operating AV technology in drivers with preclinical AD.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 40 participants: 19 older adults (age 74.16 & PLUSMN; 4.78; MOCA scores 26.42 & PLUSMN; 2.52) with preclinical AD, evidenced by elevated cortical beta-amyloid; and 21 controls (age 73.81 & PLUSMN; 5.62; MOCA scores 28.24 & PLUSMN; 1.67). All participants completed two scenarios in a driving simulator. Scenario 1 included conditional automation with an emergency event that required a manual take-over maneuver. Scenario 2 was identical but with a cognitive distractor task. Emergency response time was the main safety outcome measure. Cognitive workload was calculated using moment-to-moment changes in pupillary size and converted into an Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA). Mann-Whitney U and independent t-tests were used to compare group differences.Results: Emergency response times were similar between drivers with preclinical AD and controls in scenario 1 (20.85s & PLUSMN; 1.08 vs 20.52s & PLUSMN; 3.18; p = 0.83) and scenario 2 (14.83s & PLUSMN; 7.37 vs 13.45s & PLUSMN; 10.43; p = 0.92). Likewise, no differences were found in ICA between drivers with preclinical AD and controls in scenario 1 (0.34 & PLUSMN; 0.08 vs 0.33 & PLUSMN; 0.17; p = 0.74) or scenario 2 (0.30 & PLUSMN; 0.07 vs 0.29 & PLUSMN; 0.17; p = 0.93). Conclusions: Older drivers with preclinical AD may safely operate AV technology, without increased response times or cognitive workload. Future on-road studies with AV technology should confirm these preliminary results in drivers with preclinical AD.","[Ahmadnezhad, Pedram M.; Akinwuntan, Abiodun; Devos, Hannes] Univ Kansas, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training, Med Ctr, Kansas City, KS USA; [Burns, Jeffrey E.; Mahnken, Jonathan; Devos, Hannes] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Alzheimers Dis Res Ctr, Kansas City, KS USA; [Akinwuntan, Abiodun] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Center Community Access Rehabil Res Educ & Serv KU, Kansas City, KS USA; [Ranchet, Maud] Univ Lyon, Univ Gustave Eiffel, IFSTTAR, F-69675 Lyon, France; [Kondyli, Alexandra D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Lawrence, KS USA; [Mahnken, Jonathan] Univ Kansas, Dept Biostat & Data Sci, Med Ctr, Kansas City, KS USA; [Devos, Hannes] Univ Kansas, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training, Med Ctr, MS2002,3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA",University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; University of Kansas; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center,"Devos, H (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Phys Therapy Rehabil Sci & Athlet Training, Med Ctr, MS2002,3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA.",hdevos@kumc.edu,"/AAF-2672-2019; Devos, Hannes/I-6852-2019; RANCHET, Maud/HPH-5368-2023","Kondyli, Alexandra/0000-0002-3462-0000; RANCHET, Maud/0000-0002-5325-064X","Forrest and Sally Hoglund; National Institutes of Health [S10 RR29577]; National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health [K01 AG058785, P30 AG072973]; KU Alzheimer Disease Research Center [P30 AG035982]",Forrest and Sally Hoglund; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); KU Alzheimer Disease Research Center,This work was completed at the Hoglund Biomedical Imaging Center which is supported by the Forrest and Sally Hoglund and a High-End Instrumentation grant from the National Institutes of Health (S10 RR29577).

However, most studies have focused on young adults. Therefore, we investigated cognitive fatigue through changes in RT distributions in three age groups-young, middle-aged, and older adults-during a 160-min Stroop task. Task duration was divided into four blocks and the ex-Gaussian parameters (mu, sigma, tau) were extracted from individual RT distributions in each time block for each item type. The results showed a significant Group effect on mu. Young adults had smaller mu values than the other two groups, meaning that middle-aged and older people performed the whole task slower than young adults. By contrast, tau showed no Group effect but increased with Time-on-Task in middle-aged people. Older adults did not show tau increase with Time-on-Task, which echoes studies showing some resistance to task monotony in this population. Globally, our results showed dissociated age and Time-on-Task effect on the ex-Gaussian parameters, confirming the relevance of this approach in the cognitive fatigue domain. We proposed here that cognitive fatigue affects only the decision component of response production, and that midlife may be a life stage with high sensitivity to cognitive fatigue.","[Gilsoul, Jessica; Depierreux, Frederique; Collette, Fabienne] Univ Liege, GIGA CRC Vivo Imaging, Allee 6 Aout 8 B30, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Libertiaux, Vincent] Univ Liege, FARAH, Liege, Belgium",University of Liege; University of Liege,"Collette, F (corresponding author), Univ Liege, GIGA CRC Vivo Imaging, Allee 6 Aout 8 B30, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",jessica.gilsoul@gmail.com; Vincent.Libertiaux@gmail.com; fdepierreux@uliege.be; f.collette@uliege.be,,"Collette, Fabienne/0000-0001-9288-9756",Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique-FNRS,Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"We thank Etienne Quertemont for the revision of statistical procedures, Islay Campbell for correction of English language, and Patrick Lemaire for helpful conceptual comments reading this work.",,87,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1068-0667,1573-3440,,J ADULT DEV,J.

Using a multi-level Bayesian model controlling for task difficulty and past performance, we found strong evidence that workload both during and preceding a tracking trial was predictive of performance, such that higher workload led to poorer performance. These negative workload-performance relationships were remarkably consistent across individuals. Importantly, we demonstrate that fluctuations in workload independent from the task demands accounted for significant performance variation.

Models of driver behavior that predict these transitions from data are a critical tool for designing safer, human-centered, systems but current models do not sufficiently account for human factors. Active inference theory is a promising approach to integrate human factors because of its grounding in cognition and translation to a quantitative modeling framework.Method We used data from a driving simulation to develop an active inference model of takeover performance. After validating the model's predictions, we used Bayesian regression with a spike and slab prior to assess substantial correlations between model parameters and self-reported trust, situation awareness, fatigue, and demographic factors.Results The model accurately captured driving takeover times. The regression results showed that increases in cognitive fatigue were associated with increased uncertainty about the need to takeover, attributable to mapping observations to environmental states. Higher situation awareness was correlated with a more precise understanding of the environment and state transitions. Higher trust was associated with increased variance in environmental conditions associated with environmental states.Conclusion The results align with prior theory on trust and active inference and provide a critical connection between complex driver states and interpretable model parameters.Application The active inference framework can be used in the testing and validation of automated vehicle technology to calibrate design parameters to ensure safety.","[Wei, Ran; Garcia, Alfredo] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA; [McDonald, Anthony D.; Mehta, Ranjana K.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, 1513 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"McDonald, AD (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, 1513 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",admcdonald@wisc.edu,,"Mehta, Ranjana/0000-0002-8254-8365; McDonald, Anthony/0000-0001-7827-8828",National Science Foundation [2035367],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following fi nancial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Support for this research was provided in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation award number 2035367.",,75,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

The challenge for industries is to develop human-centred scheduling systems that orchestrate the interaction between human and machines devices considering both operations productivity and human well-being. In this paper, a cyber-physical production system integrating a smart station is proposed to dynamically change the schedule of tasks to human operators, regarding the cognitive fatigue level during execution. The smart station consists in a human operator connected to a galvanometer that tracks electric currents on his skin coupled to a virtual holon that seeks the human well-being minimising his cognitive fatigue estimated from the tracking of the current. This Holon is also in charge of the modification of the scheduling through the adaption of the workload. A real experiment has been conducted to validate the contribution of the proposed approach and the results demonstrate significant mitigation of human wellbeing degradation in term of cognitive fatigue.","[Paredes-Astudillo, Yenny A.] Politecn Grancolombiano, Dept Ind Engn, Bogota, Colombia; [Moreno, Diego; Vargas, Ana-Maria; Angel, Maria-Alejandra; Perez, Sergio; Jimenez, Jose-Fernando; Saavedra-Robinson, Luis A.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Ind Engn, Bogota, Colombia; [Trentesaux, Damien] Univ Polytech Hauts de France, UMR CNRS 8201, LAMIH, Valenciennes, France",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Polytechnique Hauts-de-France,"Paredes-Astudillo, YA (corresponding author), Politecn Grancolombiano, Dept Ind Engn, Bogota, Colombia.",yparedes@poligran.edu.co; dmorenoz@javeriana.edu.co; avargas.r@javeriana.edu.co; angel_m@javeriana.edu.co; sergioperez@javeriana.edu.co; j-jimenez@javeriana.edu.co; l.saavedra@javeriana.edu.co; damien.trentesaux@uphf.fr,"Jimenez, Jose/AAX-8877-2020",,,,,,20,1,1,1,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-5871-6,,,,2020,,,,,,,253,258,,10.1109/ichms49158.2020.9209366,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ichms49158.2020.9209366,,,6,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Ergonomics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering,BU0XB,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000872028200050,View Full Record in Web of Science

Background: The effects of workload, fatigue, practice, and time on a specific task can be separated with the two models and an appropriate experimental design. Group dynamics add further complications to the understanding of workload and fatigue effects for teams. Method: In this experiment, 141 undergraduates responded to target stimuli that appeared on a simulated security camera display at three rates of speed while completing a jigsaw puzzle. Participants worked alone or in pairs and completed additional measurements prior to or after the main tasks. Results: The workload cusp verified the expected effects of speed and frustration on change in performance. The fatigue cusp showed that positive and negative changes in performance were greater if more work on the secondary task was completed and whether the participants who started with the fast vigilance condition demonstrated less fatigue. Conclusion: The results supported the efficacy of the cusp models and suggested, furthermore, that training modules that varied speed of presentation could buffer the effects of fatigue. Application: The cusp models can be used to analyze virtually any cognitively demanding task set. The particular results generalize to vigilance tasks, although a wider range of conditions within vigilance tasks needs to be investigated further.","[Guastello, Stephen J.; Malon, Matthew; Timm, Paul; Weinberger, Kelsey; Gorin, Hillary; Fabisch, Megan; Poston, Kirsten] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Marquette University,"Guastello, SJ (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",Stephen.guastello@marquette.edu,,"Guastello, Stephen/0000-0003-1059-7341",,,,,75,23,27,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Both workload and trust are dynamic variables that change over time based on current task allocation and on the result of past interactions. In this paper, we propose a methodology leveraging quantitative models of trust and workload to automatically and dynamically suggest efficient task allocations in mixed human-machine systems. Our approach is based on a Markov decision process framework and is presented for concreteness in the context of a human-machine team performing repeated binary decision-making tasks. Simulation results show the emergence of interesting automation behaviors such as seeking trust, attempting to repair trust after an error and adjusting human workload for optimal performance. Overall, the human-aware dynamic task allocation strategy shows the potential of significant team performance improvement compared to a static task distribution, even in the presence of significant errors in the trust and workload models used.","[Dubois, Clemence; Le Ny, Jerome] Polytech Montreal, Dept Elect Engn, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Dubois, Clemence; Le Ny, Jerome] GERAD, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Dubois, C (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, Dept Elect Engn, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.;Dubois, C (corresponding author), GERAD, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.",clemence.dubois@polymtl.ca; jerome.le-ny@polymtl.ca,"Le Ny, Jerome/D-9586-2012",,Canadian Department of National Defence under the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Micro-Net program,Canadian Department of National Defence under the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Micro-Net program,This work was supported by the Canadian Department of National Defence under the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Micro-Net program.,,23,5,6,6,23,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1062-922X,,978-1-7281-8526-2,IEEE SYS MAN CYBERN,,,2020,,,,,,,3241,3246,,10.1109/smc42975.2020.9283461,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/smc42975.2020.9283461,,,6,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Information Systems",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS1DD,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000687430603043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Background: Level 2 partial automation requires a driver to maintain supervisory control of the vehicle to detect edge cases that the automation is not equipped to handle. There is mixed evidence regarding whether drivers can do so effectively. There is also an open question regarding how practice and familiarity with automation influence driver cognitive states over time. Method: Behavioral and neurophysiological measures of driver workload and visual engagement were recorded from 30 participants at two testing sessions-with a six-week familiarization period in-between. At both testing sessions, participants drove a vehicle with partial automation engaged (Level 2) and not engaged (Level 0) on two interstate highwayswhile reaction times to the detection response task (DRT) and neurophysiological (EEG) metrics of frontal theta and parietal alpha were recorded. Results: DRT results demonstrated that partially automated driving placed more cognitive load on drivers than manual driving and six weeks of practice decreased driver workload-though only when the driving environment was relatively simple. EEG metrics of frontal theta and parietal alpha showed null effects of partial automation. Conclusion: Driver workload was influenced by level of automation, specific highway characteristics, and by practice over time, but only on a behavioral level and not on a neural level. Application: These findings expand our understanding of the influence of practice on driver cognitive states under Level 2 partial automation.","[Mcdonnell, Amy S.] Univ Utah, Appl Cognit Lab, Dept Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Crabtree, Kaedyn W.; Strayer, David L.] Univ Utah, Appl Cognit Lab, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Cooper, Joel M.] Red Sci Inc, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Strayer, David L.] Univ Utah, Dept Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Mcdonnell, Amy S.] Univ Utah, Dept Psychol, 380 S 1530 E,Room 502, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Mcdonnell, AS (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Psychol, 380 S 1530 E,Room 502, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",amy.mcdonnell@utah.edu,,"McDonnell, Amy/0000-0002-2456-9424",Support for this work was provided by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.; AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,Support for this work was provided by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.; AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,Support for this work was provided by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.,,59,3,3,5,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

This study uses an Improved Performance Research Integration Tool simulation, based upon a human-in-the-loop study, to examine two different revoking strategies (minimum duration and workload threshold) across numerous levels in order to identify impacts on operator workload and SA. This study finds that operator workload and SA are affected by the type of revoking strategy as well as the particular level used for that strategy.

Methods: The participants' perceived workload was modulated during a teleoperation task involving an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shepherding a swarm of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Three sources of data were recorded from sixteen participants (n = 16): heart rate (HR), EEG, and subjective indicators of the perceived workload using the Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT). Results: The HR data predicted the scores from ATWIT. Nineteen common EEG features offered a discriminatory power of the four workload setups with high classification accuracy (82.23%), exhibiting a higher sensitivity than ATWIT and HR. Conclusion: The identified set of features represents EEG indicators for the objective assessment of cognitive workload across subjects. These common indicators could be used for augmented intelligence in human-autonomy teaming scenarios, and form the basis for our work on designing a closed-loop augmented cognition system for human-swarm teaming.","[Fernandez Rojas, Raul; Debie, Essam; Barlow, Michael; Kasmarik, Kathryn; Anavatti, Sreenatha; Garratt, Matthew; Abbass, Hussein] Univ New South Wales, Sch Engn & IT, Canberra, NSW, Australia; [Fidock, Justin] Def Sci & Technol Org, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Defence Science & Technology,"Rojas, RF (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Engn & IT, Canberra, NSW, Australia.",r.fernandezrojas@adfa.edu.au,"Rojas, Raul/ABD-9685-2020; Abbass, Hussein/C-9563-2009; D, E/JRY-0932-2023","Fernandez Rojas, Raul/0000-0002-8393-4241","Commonwealth of Australia through the Australian Army; Defence Science and Technology Group, as part of the Human Performance Research Network","Commonwealth of Australia through the Australian Army; Defence Science and Technology Group, as part of the Human Performance Research Network","The Commonwealth of Australia supported this research through the Australian Army and a Defence Science Partnerships agreement with the Defence Science and Technology Group, as part of the Human Performance Research Network.",,78,48,50,1,49,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

We aim to demonstrate convergent validity with existing workload measurement methods, and to decompose workload into constituent cognitive resources to aid in diagnosing causes of workload. A cognitive model of the task was developed and examined to determine the extent to which it could predict behavioral performance, subjective workload, and validated physiological workload metrics. We also examined model activity to draw insights regarding loaded cognitive capacities. We found that composite workload from the model predicted physiological metrics, performance, and subjective workload. Moreover, the model indicates that differences in workload were driven largely by procedural, declarative, and temporal memory demands. We have found preliminary evidence of correspondence between workload predictions of a CMP model and physiological measures of workload. This suggests our approach captures interesting aspects of workload in a complex task environment and may provide a theoretical link between behavioral, physiological, and subjective metrics. This approach may provide a means to design effective workload mitigation interventions and improve decision-making about personnel tasking and automation.","[Stevens, Christopher A.; Morris, Megan B.; Myers, Christopher W.] Air Force Res Lab, Cognit Models & Agents Branch, Dayton, OH 45433 USA; [Fisher, Christopher R.] Cubic Mission & Performance Solut, San Diego, CA USA",,"Stevens, CA (corresponding author), Air Force Res Lab, Cognit Models & Agents Branch, Dayton, OH 45433 USA.",christopher.stevens.28@us.af.mil,,"Stevens, Christopher/0000-0003-3178-3290",U.S. Department of Defense [AFRL-2022-4251],U.S. Department of Defense(United States Department of Defense),"A portion of these results were reported as a paper in the proceedings of the 17th annual meeting of the International Conference on Cognitive Modelling and as an abstract and poster in the 41st annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society.

These real-time measurements allow the system to estimate the operator's cognitive states, which can drive the level of automation support. This concept is adopted in our Cognitive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (CHMI2) framework. Accurate and reliable measurements from the physiological sensors are essential for the CHMI2 concept to work. The Heart Rate (HR) is one of the most commonly monitored physiological variables in aerospace applications. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of a common wearable cardiac monitoring device to carry out real time HR measurements. The validity is evaluated by comparing the processed measurements from the wearable device to a clinical validated device. Contrary to most studies which only target physical activity for such characterisation, we investigate a terminal manoeuvring area traffic management activity, which is a very challenging aerospace task involving a significant number of time-critical human-machine interactions where high levels of cognitive workload are experienced.

Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupa-tional ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics.

The study tested effects of time-on-task and automation reliability on accuracy in surveillance tasks and dependence on automation. It also investigated the role of trait and state individual difference factors. Background: Warm's resource model of vigilance has been highly influential in human factors, but further tests of its applicability to complex, real-world tasks requiring sustained attention are necessary. Multi-UAS operation differs from standard vigilance paradigms in that the operator must switch attention between multiple subtasks, with support from automation. Method: 131 participants performed surveillance tasks requiring signal discrimination and symbol counting with a multi-UAS simulation configured to impose low cognitive demands, for 2 hr. Automation reliability was manipulated between-groups. Five Factor Model personality traits were measured prior to performance. Subjective states were assessed with the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire. Results: Performance accuracy on the more demanding surveillance task showed a vigilance decrement, especially when automation reliability was low. Dependence on automation on this task declined over time. State but not trait factors predicted performance. High distress was associated with poorer performance in more demanding task conditions. Conclusions: Vigilance decrement may be an operational issue for multi-UAS surveillance missions. Warm's resource theory may require modification to incorporate changes in information processing and task strategy associated with multitasking in low-workload, fatiguing environments. Application: Interface design and operator evaluation for multi-UAS operations should address issues including motivation, stress, and sustaining attention to automation.","[Wohleber, Ryan W.] Univ Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, Human Factors Psychol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Matthews, Gerald; Lin, Jinchao] Univ Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, 3100 Technol Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32826 USA; [Szalma, James L.] Univ Cent Florida, Psychol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Calhoun, Gloria L.] US Air Force, Res Lab, 711th Human Performance Wing, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; [Funke, Gregory J.] US Air Force, Res Lab, Human Effectiveness Directorate, Appl Neurosci Branch, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; [Chiu, C. -Y.

The Task is a critical concept in the field because its features affect 12 learners' attention orientation in L2 performance. This study explored the ways in which two types of cognitive demands (reasoning demand and dual-task demand) influenced the occurrence and orientation of attention in L2 oral production. This was done by analyzing performance scores (accuracy, complexity, and fluency) and verbal protocols (indicators of attention to lexis, syntax, and phonology). The limited-resource model and the multiple-resource model provided theoretical frameworks for this study. The reasoning demand increased accuracy scores, but the dual-task demand did not. Both types of task demands reduced fluency scores, but no effects were found on complexity scores. The verbal protocol analysis suggested that task demands inhibited learners' attention to syntactic encoding. Overall, the results support the limited-resource model, at least in the monologic task condition employed in this study, leading to the suggestion that task demands may need to be eased to help direct learners' attention to linguistic form and thus enhance L2 acquisition.

Instructors observe scenarios and direct adaptive responses to unexpected events. Simulation operators typically use a graphical interface to monitor the scenario and generate specific interventions that implement the instructor's intent. These activities require the operators' attention and cognitive resources, particularly for complex directions and scenarios with multiple entities to monitor. We are developing automated tools to reduce operator workload, thereby increasing the cost effectiveness of training. We use cognitive workload analysis to identify situations in which operators would be overloaded, and to identify the factors that cause the overloading. By identifying workload hot spots, we can target more effective automated support strategies. GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection) is a theoretical framework for workload analysis that has been applied to many modeling and automation applications. We use GOMS to create a detailed characterization of a set of typical monitoring and intervention tasks for fixed-wing air combat training. This enabled us to synthesize predictive models for combinations of these tasks. The models indicate where operators are likely to have difficulty implementing instructor's intent, as well as where operators are unlikely to be able to complete their tasks correctly. We then used these predictive models to guide the development of tools for reducing operator workload, as well as experimental scenarios for evaluating the effectiveness of those tools. This paper discusses the approach to GOMS modeling, as well as the details of how we used the predictive GOMS models to identify cognitive workload limitations.

Staying vigilant imposes a high-cognitive workload and so is hypothesized to pose varying difficulties across the driving population, leading to differences in individual susceptibility to vigilance decrement. To investigate this, the present study proposes the use of an objective neurometric of mental workload to characterize drivers' severity of vigilance decrement during assisted driving with adaptive cruise control. Drivers performed a car-following task for approximately 1.5 h and performed emergency braking whenever the leading car brakes suddenly. The neurometric, frontal theta / parietal alpha ratio-measured from an alert-state driving period using a wearable electroencephalography headset-was found to be associated with the magnitude of drivers' behavioral changes (cumulative slowing and erraticity of their braking reaction times) over the course of the assisted driving tour. This is the first study to explore the use of an alert-state objective measure in profiling individuals' general susceptibility to vigilance decrements in assisted driving, which is highly relevant in the context of identifying higher risk drivers and designing driver-vehicle interaction systems to enhance automation use safety.","[Seet, Manuel; Thakor, Nitish] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Hlth, Singapore 117456, Singapore; [Bezerianos, Anastasios; Panou, Maria; Bekiaris, Evangelos] Hellen Inst Transport, Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Thessaloniki 5700, Greece; [Dragomir, Andrei] Univ Houston, Dept Biomed Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA",National University of Singapore; Centre for Research & Technology Hellas; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Dragomir, A (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biomed Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",andrei.drag@gmail.com,"Thakor, Nitish/A-5878-2008; Bezerianos, Tasos/AAC-2499-2022; Dragomir, Andrei/F-5411-2012; Dragomir, Andrei/I-7544-2017; Thakor, Nitish/G-9110-2015","Dragomir, Andrei/0000-0003-2815-6958; Thakor, Nitish/0000-0002-9981-9395","NUS Startup Grant at the National University of Singapore (NUS) - A*STAR and Procter and Gamble [R-719-000-200-133, APG2013/131]; SAFE-UP Project [031019]",NUS Startup Grant at the National University of Singapore (NUS) - A*STAR and Procter and Gamble; SAFE-UP Project,"This work was supported in part by NUS Startup Grant at the National University of Singapore (NUS) funded by A*STAR and Procter and Gamble, under Grant R-719-000-200-133 and Grant APG2013/131, and in part by the SAFE-UP Project through Horizon 2020 Programme under Grant 031019.",,41,3,3,4,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2379-8920,2379-8939,,IEEE T COGN DEV SYST,IEEE Trans.

We investigate several predictors of fatigue, including subjective workload estimates, sleep duration, the shift being worked, and production levels. High levels of fatigue were reported in one-third of the shifts evaluated. The main predictors of high fatigue were workload estimates, working evening shifts, and baseline fatigue. Among the six dimensions of workload, only mental demand and frustration were predictors of high fatigue. Mental demand was also rated highest. Participants reported less than seven hours of sleep in 60% of the nights evaluated. These results suggest that managers and supervisors should consider cognitive workload as a key contributing factor to fatigue in complex manual assembly. Similarly, work schedule planning should consider shift duration, start times, and end times, because of the negative influence on fatigue and the potential disruptions on sleep among workers. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: General fatigue and mental workload have been studied extensively in safety-critical contexts; wherein human performance degradation can lead to catastrophic outcomes. In the manufacturing sector, the physical demands of a job have received most of the attention because of the presence of biomechanical loads and the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders. However, in complex manual assembly, cognitive and chronobiology aspects of work can contribute to fatigue and degrade worker performance. Purpose: We aimed to evaluate self-reported levels of fatigue and workload among a group of workers performing complex assembly tasks. We also sought to investigate several predictors of fatigue, including workload estimates, sleep duration, the shift being worked, and production levels. Methods: Fourteen assembly line workers participated in a two-week study. They evaluated their levels of fatigue at the beginning and end of each shift using the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Scale. They also evaluated their workload according to the NASA-TLX scale at the end of each shift. Results: High levels of fatigue (fatigue score >= 5) were reported in approximately one-third of 114 work shifts evaluated. Binary logistic regression indicated that fatigue scores at the beginning of the shift, NASA-TLX scores, and working evening shifts were significant predictors of high levels of fatigue. Among the six dimensions measured by NASA-TLX, only mental demand and frustration were predictors of high fatigue. Mental demand was also rated highest by the workers. Participants reported less than seven hours of sleep in 60% of the nights evaluated. Conclusions: These results suggest that cognitive load can contribute to fatigue in complex manual assembly work. Circadian and homeostatic processes related to shift duration, start times, and end times are also potential contributing factors. Similarly, existing work schedules may be contributing to sleep disruptions among workers.","[Torres, Yaniel; Nadeau, Sylvie; Landau, Kurt] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Landau, Kurt] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Ergon & Human Factors, Darmstadt, Germany",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; Technical University of Darmstadt,"Torres, Y (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",yaniel.torres-medina.1@ens.etsmtl.ca,"Torres, Yaniel/IWD-8411-2023","Torres, Yaniel/0000-0002-9825-9437",MITACS [IT12360]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),MITACS; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This research was funded by MITACS, grant number IT12360 and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).",,92,8,8,4,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2472-5838,2472-5846,,IISE T OCCUP ERG HUM,IISE Trans.

Malleable attentional resources allocation theory describes two possible processes that can generate workload in interaction with advanced assisting devices. The purpose of the present study is to determine if specific analysis of the different modalities of autonomic control of nervous system can be used to discriminate different potential workload processes generated during assisted-driving tasks and automation complacency situations. Thirty-five drivers were tested in a virtual scenario while using head-up advanced warning assistance system. Repeated MANOVA were used to examine changes in autonomic activity across a combination of different user interactions generated by the advanced assistance system: (1) expected take-over request without anticipatory warning; (2) expected take-over request with two-second anticipatory warning; (3) unexpected take-over request with misleading warning; (4) unexpected take-over request without warning. Results shows that analysis of autonomic modulations can discriminate two different resources allocation processes, related to different behavioral performances. The user's interaction that required divided attention under expected situations produced performance enhancement and reciprocally-coupled parasympathetic inhibition with sympathetic activity. At the same time, supervising interactions that generated automation complacency were described specifically by uncoupled sympathetic activation.

Background: Stimulus detection tasks are a relative simple and inexpensive means of measuring the operator's state. While stimulus detection tasks may be better geared to measure conditions of high workload, adopting this approach for the assessment of low workload may be more problematic. Method: This mini-review details the use of common stimulus detection tasks and their contributions to the Human Factors practice. It also borrows from the conceptual framework of the inverted-U shape model to discuss the issue of data interpretation. Results: The evidence being discussed here highlights a clear limitation of stimulus detection task paradigms. Conclusion: There is an inherent risk in using a unidimensional tool like stimulus detection tasks as the primary source of information for determining the operator's psychophysiological state.

Bifurcation, or trigger variables can have a positive or negative effect on outcomes, depending on the levels of asymmetry, or background variables. The participants were 1262 production employees of two steel manufacturing facilities who completed a survey that measured safety management, anxiety, subjective danger, dysregulation, stressors and hazards. Nonlinear regression analyses showed, for this industry, that the accident process was explained by a cusp catastrophe model in which safety management and anxiety were bifurcation variables, and hazards, age and experience were asymmetry variables. The accuracy of the cusp model (R-2 = .72) exceeded that of the next best log-linear model (R-2 = .08) composed from the same survey variables. The results are thought to generalize to any industry where serious injuries could occur, although situationally specific effects should be anticipated as well.","[Guastello, Stephen J.] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Lynn, Mark] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA",Marquette University; Northwestern University,"Guastello, SJ (corresponding author), Marquette Univ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",stephen.guastello@marquette.edu,,"Guastello, Stephen/0000-0003-1059-7341",,,,,63,12,13,2,34,SOC CHAOS THEORY PSYCHOLOGY & LIFE SCIENCES,PEWAUKEE,"W282 N4302 SOMERSET LN, PEWAUKEE, WI 53072 USA",1090-0578,1573-6652,,NONLIN DYNAM PSYCHOL,Nonlinear Dyn.

In particular, for remote collaboration, flexible mechanisms such as authoring tools can be used to generate instructions and assist human operators as they experience increased complexity in their daily tasks. In addition to the traditional handicap of ensuring instructions can be intuitively created without having to understand complicated AR concepts, another relevant topic is the fact that the quality of said instructions is not properly analyzed prior to the tools being evaluated. This means that the characteristics of the visual content are not adequately assessed beforehand. Hence, it is essential to be aware of the cognitive workload associated with AR instructions to assert if they can be easily understood and accepted before being deployed in real-world scenarios. To address this, we focused on AR during sessions of remote guidance. Based on a participatory process with domain experts from the industry sector, a prototype for creating AR-based instructions was developed, and a user study with two parts was conducted: (1) first, a set of step-by-step instructions was produced, and their visual characteristics were evaluated by 129 participants based on a set of relevant dimensions; (2) afterward, these instructions were used by nine participants to understand if they could be used to assist on-site collaborators during real-life remote maintenance tasks. The results suggest that the AR instructions offer low visual complexity and considerable visual impact, clarity, and directed focus, thus improving situational understanding and promoting task resolution.","[Marques, Bernardo] Univ Aveiro, DeCA, DigiMedia, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Marques, Bernardo; Silva, Samuel; Dias, Paulo; Santos, Beatriz Sousa] Univ Aveiro, DETI, IEETA, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ferreira, Carlos] Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT, IEETA, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Santos, Andreia] Univ Aveiro, DGeo, GeoBioTec, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Marques, B (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, DeCA, DigiMedia, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;Marques, B (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, DETI, IEETA, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",bernardo.marques@ua.pt,"Marques, Bernardo/AGY-4340-2022; Dias, Paulo/G-3681-2013","Dias, Paulo/0000-0002-3754-2749; Silva, Samuel/0000-0002-9858-8249; Marques, Bernardo/0000-0002-4454-710X; Ferreira, Carlos/0000-0002-2799-643X",IEETA-Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro - National Funds through FCT [UIDB/00127/2020],IEETA-Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro - National Funds through FCT,"This research was supported by IEETA-Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro, funded by National Funds through FCT, in the context of the project [UIDB/00127/2020].",,56,5,5,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2414-4088,,MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOG,Multimodal Technol.

Since intuitive human-machine interaction (HMI) in robotic systems becomes a significant objective of technical progress, new models of work organization are needed. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following two aims: The first aim is to identify relevant research questions related to the potential use of robotic systems in different systems of work organization at the manufacturing shop-floor level. The second aim is to discuss the conceptualization of (old) organizational problems of human-robot interaction (HRI). In this context, the article reflects on the limits of cognitive and perceptual workload for robot operators in complex working systems. This will be particularly relevant whenever more robots with different roles are to be increasingly used in the manufacturing industry. The integration of such complex socio-technical systems needs further empirical and conceptual research with regard to social aspects of the technical dimension. Future research should, therefore, also integrate economic and societal issues to understand the full dimensions of new human-robot interaction in industry today.","[Moniz, Antonio B.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Sci & Technol, CICS NOVA, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Moniz, Antonio B.; Krings, Bettina-Johanna] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Technol Assessment & Syst Anal, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Moniz, AB (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Sci & Technol, CICS NOVA, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.;Moniz, AB (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Technol Assessment & Syst Anal, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",antonio.moniz@kit.edu; bettina-johanna.krings@kit.edu,"Moniz, Antonio/A-3852-2010; Krings, Bettina-Johanna/ABG-4902-2021","Moniz, Antonio/0000-0001-6044-1519; Krings, Bettina-Johanna/0000-0002-4253-0136",project Intuitive interaction between humans and industrial robot systems (I3RS); project Social implications of robotics in manufacturing industry (IR@MI) at KIT; project Work and Technology at ITAS,project Intuitive interaction between humans and industrial robot systems (I3RS); project Social implications of robotics in manufacturing industry (IR@MI) at KIT; project Work and Technology at ITAS,"The authors have received support from the projects Intuitive interaction between humans and industrial robot systems (I3RS), Social implications of robotics in manufacturing industry (IR@MI) at KIT and Work and Technology at ITAS to this research work.

However, the complexity of the pulsatile flows within the vasculature and non-linear behavior of the instruments hinder the use of model-based approaches for RL. This paper describes model-free generative adversarial imitation learning to automate a standard arterial catherization task. The automation policies have been trained in a pre-clinical setting. Detailed validation results show high success rates after skill transfer to a different vascular anatomical model. The quality of the catheter motions also shows less mean and maximum contact forces compared to manual-based approaches.","[Chi, Wenqiang; Dagnino, Giulio; Anh Nguyen; Kundrat, Dennis; Abdelaziz, Mohamed E.

Sustained attention tasks are stressful and could have potential health consequences for employees including contributing to Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs). OBJECTIVE: The study investigates if lowered task engagement (low task motivation/focus) is a mediator of the relationship between sustained attention and musculoskeletal complaints. METHOD: A structural equation modelling technique was used to determine if task engagement mediates the relationship between attention demand/attention supply and self-reported musculoskeletal complaints (MSCs) in manufacturing employees (n = 235). RESULTS: Study participants were 5.16 times (OR, odds ratio) more likely to have neck complaints, 7.27 (OR) times more likely to have upper back complaints and 3.9 (OR) times more likely to report lower back complaints (OR 2.05) when attention demands were high and task engagement was low. When task engagement was introduced as a mediator between attention supply and MSCs, odds ratios decreased for neck (from 1.01 to 0.60), shoulder (from 0.95 to 0.47) (p < 0.01), upper back (from 1.01 to 0.70) (p < 0.01) and lower back (from 0.94 to 0.40)*.

The increasing importance of information and communication techniques and computerization in production (e. g. smart production control, cyberphysical systems) as well as increasing relevance of computerization in various industries, the fourth industrial revolution, result in new challenges for occupational health and safety. Little is as yet known about the health consequences of technological change. Material and methods. In two companies in the semiconductor industry (manufacturer, component supplier), expert interviews were conducted with seven employees (per company) from different departments. The interviews were transcribed and qualitative thematic analyses were conducted using MAXQDA. Results. The technical status of both companies differed with respect to the state of technology but there was an overall indication that the employees are constantly exposed to changes and transitions that require personal adjustments and modifications. Qualification measures, life-long learning and increasing cognitive demands on the employees are an important issue. Conclusion. While the health impacts of physically demanding work decline as technology and automation takes on more and more physically demanding tasks, psychological burdens are arising due to increasing monitoring and decision-making requirements. Issues of occupational health and safety that foster health-promoting work must take into account new demands as well as the classical hazards.","[Drossler, S.; Steputat, A.; Kampf, D.; Seidler, A.] Tech Univ Dresden, Med Fak, Inst & Poliklin Arbeits & Sozialmed, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Baranyi, G.] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Edinburgh,"Drössler, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Med Fak, Inst & Poliklin Arbeits & Sozialmed, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",stephanie.droessler@tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-2502,2198-0713,,ZENTRALBLATT ARB ARB,Zentralblatt Arb.

Adaptive robot behavior unavoidably carries decision-making needs regarding task allocation and scheduling. Such decisions can be made either by the human team members or autonomously, by the robot's controlling algorithm. Human authority may help preserve situational awareness but increases mental demands due to increased responsibilities. Conversely, granting authority to the robot can offload the operator, at the cost of reduced intervention readiness. This paper aims to investigate the question of decision authority assignment in a human-robot team, in terms of performance, perceived workload and subjective preference. We hypothesized that the answer is influenced by the cognitive workload imposed on the human operator by the work process. An experiment with 21 participants was conducted, in which decision authority and induced workload through a secondary task were varied between trials. Results confirmed that operators can support the robot better when decision authority is allocated according to their workload. However, operator decision authority (a) may cause inferior performance at any secondary tasks performed in parallel with robot supervision and (b) increases perceived workload. Subjective preference was found to be evenly divided between the two levels of decision authority, and unaffected by task difficulty. In brief, if human-robot team performance is a priority, humans should be granted decision authority when their overall workload allows it. In high-workload conditions, system decision-making algorithms should be developed. Nonetheless, process designers should be mindful of the interpersonal differences between operators who are destined to collaborate with robots.","[Karakikes, Michail] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Nathanael, Dimitris] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, Greece",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Technical University of Athens,"Nathanael, D (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Athens, Greece.",mkarakikes@gmail.com; dnathan@central.ntua.gr,"Nathanael, Dimitris/AAN-1076-2021","Karakikes, Michail/0000-0002-2315-7815; Nathanael, Dimitris/0000-0003-2361-549X",Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich; HEAL-Link Greece,Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich; HEAL-Link Greece,This study was funded by Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich.

However, the successful integration of these cutting-edge tools hinges on a better understanding of human factors when interacting with such new technologies, eventually fostering workers' trust and acceptance and promoting low-fatigue work. This study thus delves into the intricate dynamics of human-cobot interactions by adopting a human-centric view.Methods: With this intent, we targeted senior workers, who often contend with diminishing work capabilities, and we explored the nexus between various human factors and task outcomes during a joint assembly operation with a cobot on an ergonomic workstation. Exploiting a dual-task manipulation to increase the task demand, we measured performance, subjective perceptions, eye-tracking indices and cardiac activity during the task. Firstly, we provided an overview of the senior workers' perceptions regarding their shared work with the cobot, by measuring technology acceptance, perceived wellbeing, work experience, and the estimated social impact of this technology in the industrial sector. Secondly, we asked whether the considered human factors varied significantly under dual-tasking, thus responding to a higher mental load while working alongside the cobot. Finally, we explored the predictive power of the collected measurements over the number of errors committed at the work task and the participants' perceived workload.Results: The present findings demonstrated how senior workers exhibited strong acceptance and positive experiences with our advanced workstation and the cobot, even under higher mental strain. Besides, their task performance suffered increased errors and duration during dual-tasking, while the eye behavior partially reflected the increased mental demand. Some interesting outcomes were also gained about the predictive power of some of the collected indices over the number of errors committed at the assembly task, even though the same did not apply to predicting perceived workload levels.Discussion: Overall, the paper discusses possible applications of these results in the 5.0 manufacturing sector, emphasizing the importance of adopting a holistic human-centered approach to understand the human-cobot complex better.","[Pluchino, Patrik; Pernice, Gabriella F.

We investigate whether typing behavior is connected to two factors: the cognitive demands of a given task and the demographic features of the typist. We utilize features based on keystroke dynamics, stylometry, and language production, which are novel hybrid features that capture the dynamics of a typists linguistic choices. Our study takes advantage of a large data set (similar to 350 subjects) made up of relatively short samples (similar to 450 characters) of free text. Experiments show that these features can recognize the cognitive demands of task that an unseen typist is engaged in, and can classify his or her demographics with better than chance accuracy. We correctly distinguish HIGH vs. Low cognitively demanding tasks with accuracy up to 72.39%. Detection of non-native speakers of English is achieved with F-1=0.462 over a baseline of 0.166, while detection of female typists reaches F-1=0.524 over a baseline of 0.442.

The proliferation of fake news has severely affected people's intentions and behaviors in trusting online sources. Applying AI approaches for fake news detection on social media is the focus of recent research, most of which, however, focuses on enhancing AI performance. This study proposes XFlag, an innovative explainable AI (XAI) framework which uses long short-term memory (LSTM) model to identify fake news articles, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm to explain the fake news detection model based on LSTM, and situation awareness-based agent transparency (SAT) model to increase transparency in human-AI interaction. The developed XFlag framework has been empirically validated. The findings suggest the use of XFlag supports users in understanding system goals (perception), justifying system decisions (comprehension), and predicting system uncertainty (projection), with little cost of perceived cognitive workload.","[Chien, Shih-Yi; Yang, Cheng-Jun; Yu, Fang] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, 64,Sec 2,Zhi Nan Rd, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chien, SY (corresponding author), Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, 64,Sec 2,Zhi Nan Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.",sychien@nccu.edu.tw,"Yu, Fang/C-2933-2014",,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 109-2410-H-004-067-MY2, MOST 109-2221-E-004-008-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant MOST 109-2410-H-004-067-MY2 and MOST 109-2221-E-004-008-MY3.",,67,14,15,5,55,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1044-7318,1532-7590,,INT J HUM-COMPUT INT,Int.

The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators' detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.","[Shi, Chao] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, 4400 Vestal Pkwy East, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Rothrock, Ling] Penn State Univ, Harold & Inge Marcus Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, 310 Leonhard Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Binghamton University, SUNY; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Shi, C (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Syst Sci & Ind Engn, 4400 Vestal Pkwy East, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",cshi@binghamton.edu; lxr28@psu.edu,"Shi, Chao/KWU-4188-2024","Rothrock, Ling/0000-0001-7614-5132",Abnormal Situation Management Consortium Support,Abnormal Situation Management Consortium Support,This work was supported by Abnormal Situation Management Consortium Support.,,34,4,4,5,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6870,1872-9126,,APPL ERGON,Appl.

Thus, drivers' states can still affect driving safety in SAE L3 vehicles. Previous research found that a high cognitive load may impair drivers' takeover performance. Thus, it is still necessary to estimate drivers' cognitive load in SAE L3 vehicles. However, existing driver cognitive load estimation algorithms mostly focus on vehicles with a lower level of driving automation (e.g., SAE L0), which may not be relevant when estimating driver states in SAE L3 vehicles, given that drivers' responsibilities are different, and several commonly used measures (e.g., driving performance) are unavailable when drivers are not continuously controlling the vehicle. Further, previous driver cognitive load estimation algorithms rarely considered the temporal information in the input features. Thus, we proposed a deep-learning algorithm to estimate driver cognitive load in SAE L3 vehicles, which integrated multiple physiological features (i.e., electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, respiration) and considered the temporal correlation of the data using a transformer-encoder-based network. The performance of our algorithm was compared with baseline models on an open data set. Results showed that our algorithm outperformed baseline models and achieved an accuracy of 94.4% using within-subject data partition (proportionally splitting data from the same subject into the training and testing data sets) and an accuracy of 89% using across-subjects data partition (dividing the training and testing data sets based on individual subjects).","[Wang, Ange; Wang, Jiyao; He, Dengbo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Intelligent Transportat Thrust, Syst Hub, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wenxin; He, Dengbo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Robot & Autonomous Syst Thrust, Syst Hub, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [He, Dengbo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [He, Dengbo] HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"He, DB (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Intelligent Transportat Thrust, Syst Hub, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;He, DB (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Robot & Autonomous Syst Thrust, Syst Hub, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;He, DB (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;He, DB (corresponding author), HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",dengbohe@hkust-gz.edu.cn,"He, Dengbo/GZA-9228-2022","Wang, Jiyao/0000-0002-0743-0121",Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [2024A1515010392]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52202425]; Project of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone [HZQB-KCZYB-2020083]; Technology Program City-University Joint Funding Project [2023A03J0001],Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone; Technology Program City-University Joint Funding Project,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (2024A1515010392), and partially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 52202425), the Project of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone (HZQB-KCZYB-2020083), and Technology Program City-University Joint Funding Project (No. 2023A03J0001).",,52,2,2,9,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

We hypothesize that, once pronunciation of a word is fully prepared it can be triggered as a reflex with no need for cortical processing. We used modified protocols of picture naming tasks, with different levels of cognitive demands, to measure reaction time to word pronunciation (RTWP). In test trials, picture presentation was accompanied by a startling auditory stimulus (SAS). When one and the same picture was repeatedly shown, SAS shortened RTWP by about 30% (StartReact effect), which did not occur when random pictures were shown. If subjects were led to learn which picture was to appear after repeated presentation of three pictures in sequence, they exhibited again the StartReact effect. We conclude that word pronunciation may be fully prepared for execution in absence of cognitive demands. However, the StartReact effect is inhibited during cognitive tasks.","[Leote, Joao; Ferreira, Hugo A.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Biofis & Engn Biomed, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal; [Leote, Joao] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Lisbon, Portugal; [Leote, Joao] Hosp Garcia de Orta, Neurosurg Dept, Almada, Portugal; [Castellote, Juan M.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Madrid, Spain; [Castellote, Juan M.] Inst Salud Carlos, Natl Sch Occupat Med, Madrid, Spain; [Casanova-Molla, Jordi; Navarro-Otano, Judith; Valls-Sole, Josep] Univ Barcelona, EMG & Motor Control Unit, Neurol Dept, Hosp Clin, Barcelona, Spain; [Casanova-Molla, Jordi; Navarro-Otano, Judith; Valls-Sole, Josep] Univ Barcelona, IDIBAPS Inst Invest August Pi i Sunyer, Fac Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Nunes, Rita G.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Dept Bioengn, Lisbon, Portugal; [Nunes, Rita G.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Inst Syst & Robot ISR IST, LARSyS, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Hospital Garcia de Orta; Complutense University of Madrid; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Escuela Nacional de Medicina del Trabajo (ENMT); University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Leote, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Biofis & Engn Biomed, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal.",jlleotte@gmail.com,"Castellote, Juan/ABG-4178-2020; Casanova-Molla, Jordi/S-2375-2018; Nunes, Rita/I-6659-2013; Ferreira, Hugo/I-8538-2015; Leote Rebocho, Joao Carlos/E-4655-2018","Navarro-Otano, Judith/0000-0002-2949-947X; Nunes, Rita/0000-0001-7425-5717; Ferreira, Hugo/0000-0002-4323-3942; Leote Rebocho, Joao Carlos/0000-0001-9659-8438","Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian/Faculdade Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa (Programa Educacao pela Ciencia, GAPIC/FMUL) [2015005]; Instituto de Salud Carlos III [ESPY 112-18]; FIS grant [PI130526]","Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian/Faculdade Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa (Programa Educacao pela Ciencia, GAPIC/FMUL); Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); FIS grant","JL was partially supported by the Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian/Faculdade Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa (grant 2015005 of Programa Educacao pela Ciencia, GAPIC/FMUL); JMC by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (grant ESPY 112-18) and JVS by FIS grant PI130526.",,56,4,4,1,8,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0093-934X,1090-2155,,BRAIN LANG,Brain Lang.,MAY-JUL,2018,180,,,,,,24,30,,10.1016/j.bandl.2018.04.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2018.04.002,,,7,"Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology,GJ6XX,29677561,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000435528800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Twenty highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals described visual scenes with sentence structures 'NP1-verb-NP2' (NP = noun-phrase). Half the nouns and half the verbs were cognates and two manipulations created high control demands. Both situations that demanded higher inhibitory control pushed the cognate effect from facilitation towards interference. These findings suggest that cognates, similar to phonologically similar words within a language, can induce not only facilitation but robust interference.","[Martin, Clara D.] Basque Ctr Cognit Brain & Language, Paseo Mikeletegi 69,2nd, San Sebastian 20009, Spain; [Martin, Clara D.] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao, Spain; [Nozari, Nazbanou] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Basque Foundation for Science; Carnegie Mellon University,"Martin, CD (corresponding author), Basque Ctr Cognit Brain & Language, Paseo Mikeletegi 69,2nd, San Sebastian 20009, Spain.",c.martin@bcbl.eu,"Martin, Clara/B-4563-2012",,"Therapeutic Cognitive Neuroscience Fund; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SEV-2015-490, PSI2017-82941-P, ERC2018-092833]; Basque Government [PIBA18-29]; European Research Council [ERC-2018-COG-092833]; NSF [NSF BCS-1949631]",Therapeutic Cognitive Neuroscience Fund; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Michael Freund and Nicholas McCloskey for their help with data collection.

To reduce the cognitive workload of the operator, the robot should not only be able to learn from experience but also to plan and decide autonomously. Here, we present an approach based on Dynamic Neural Fields that apply brain-like computations to endow a robot with these cognitive functions. A neural integrator is used to model the gradual accumulation of sensory and other evidence as time-varying persistent activity of neural populations. The decision to act is modeled by a competitive dynamics between neural populations linked to different motor behaviors. They receive the persistent activation pattern of the integrators as input. In the first experiment, a robot learns rapidly by observation the sequential order of object transfers between an assistant and an operator to subsequently substitute the assistant in the joint task. The results show that the robot is able to proactively plan the series of handovers in the correct order. In the second experiment, a mobile robot searches at two different workbenches for a specific object to deliver it to an operator. The object may appear at the two locations in a certain time period with independent probabilities unknown to the robot. The trial-by-trial decision under uncertainty is biased by the accumulated evidence of past successes and choices. The choice behavior over a longer period reveals that the robot achieves a high search efficiency in stationary as well as dynamic environments.","[Wojtak, Weronika; Ferreira, Flora; Erlhagen, Wolfram] Univ Minho, Res Ctr Math, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; [Wojtak, Weronika; Vicente, Paulo; Louro, Luis; Bicho, Estela] Univ Minho, Res Ctr Algoritmi, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Wojtak, W (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Res Ctr Math, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.;Wojtak, W (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Res Ctr Algoritmi, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",w.wojtak@dei.uminho.pt; wolfram.erlhagen@math.uminho.pt,"Louro, Luís/LDF-3933-2024; Ferreira, Flora/D-5772-2017; W, Weronika/KHY-0044-2024; Bicho, Estela/M-5241-2013","Louro, Luis Filipe/0000-0003-1708-8881; Ferreira, Flora/0000-0003-1558-7230; Vicente, Paulo Sergio/0000-0003-3474-9709; Wojtak, Weronika/0000-0001-9515-2397; Bicho, Estela/0000-0003-2715-4037; Erlhagen, Wolfram/0000-0002-8150-3587","FCT [PD/BD/128183/2016, SFRH/BD/124912/2016, PTDC/MAT-APL/31393/2017]; research centre CMAT [UID/MAT/00013/2020]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/MAT-APL/31393/2017, SFRH/BD/124912/2016, PD/BD/128183/2016] Funding Source: FCT",FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); research centre CMAT; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The work received financial support from FCT through the PhD fellowships PD/BD/128183/2016 and SFRH/BD/124912/2016, the project Neurofield (PTDC/MAT-APL/31393/2017) and the research centre CMAT within the project UID/MAT/00013/2020.",,65,17,18,0,11,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

Nevertheless, future CVEs should support both paradigms of collaborative work, since asynchronous collaboration has as well its benefits, for instance a more flexible time-coordination. In this paper we present a concept of recording and later playback of highly interactive collaborative tasks in Mixed Reality (MR). Furthermore, we apply the concept in an assembly training scenario from the manufacturing industry and test it during pilot user experiments. The pilot study compared two modalities, the first one with a manufacturing manual, and another using our concept and featuring a ghost avatar. First results revealed no significant differences between both modalities in terms of time completion, hand movements, cognitive workload and usability.

One of the key characteristics that significantly influences the effectiveness of the academic geoportals is their Graphical User Interface (GUI). GUI designers can now benefit from emerging web technologies that assist in the production of intuitive interfaces to ensure high efficiency, good User Experience (UE), maximum usability and simultaneously the minimum cognitive workload. In this paper, we introduce the new GUI of the Geodata Versatile Information Transfer environment geoportal, and we present the results of a between-subjects study with 20 participants for the evaluation and comparison of the previous and the latest version. The results show that the GUI adaptations done, have a positive influence to several indicators like efficiency, UE, usability and cognitive workload.

Various groupings of spectro-temporal neural features have shown to predict the same underlying cognitive state (e.g., workload) but vary in their accuracy to generalize across contexts, experimental manipulations, and beyond a single session. In our work we address an outstanding challenge in neuroergonomic research: we quantify if (how) identified neural features and a chosen modeling approach will generalize to various manipulations defined by the same underlying psychological construct, (multi)task cognitive workload.MethodsTo do this, we train and test 20 different support vector machine (SVM) models, each given a subset of neural features as recommended from previous research or matching the capabilities of commercial devices. We compute each model's accuracy to predict which (monitoring, communications, tracking) and how many (one, two, or three) task(s) were completed simultaneously. Additionally, we investigate machine learning model accuracy to predict task(s) within- vs. between-sessions, all at the individual-level.ResultsOur results indicate gamma activity across all recording locations consistently outperformed all other subsets from the full model. Our work demonstrates that modelers must consider multiple types of manipulations which may each influence a common underlying psychological construct.DiscussionWe offer a novel and practical modeling solution for system designers to predict task through brain activity and suggest next steps in expanding our framework to further contribute to research and development in the neuroergonomics community. Further, we quantified the cost in model accuracy should one choose to deploy our BCI approach using a mobile EEG-systems with fewer electrodes-a practical recommendation from our work.","[Fox, Elizabeth L.] Wright Patterson AFB, Air Force Res Lab, Dayton, OH 45433 USA; [Ugolini, Margaret] Ball Aerosp, Dayton, OH USA; [Houpt, Joseph W.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Psychol, San Antonio, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Fox, EL (corresponding author), Wright Patterson AFB, Air Force Res Lab, Dayton, OH 45433 USA.",elizabeth.fox.9@us.af.mil,"Houpt, Joseph/KFB-7936-2024","Houpt, Joseph/0000-0002-2784-5535",The 711 Human Performance Wing Chief Scientist Office [FA8650-20-D-6203],The 711 Human Performance Wing Chief Scientist Office,"The research was supported, in part, by the 711 Human Performance Wing Chief Scientist Office (Contract # FA8650-20-D-6203).",,76,2,2,0,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2673-6195,,FRONT NEUROERGONOM,Front.

Nonetheless, the shared situational awareness between the flight crews under adverse weather con- ditions might be impaired. This research aims to evaluate the impact of a proposed enhancement in communication protocol on cognitive workload and develop a human-centred classification model to identify hazardous meteorological conditions. Thirty groups of subjects completed four post-landing taxiing tasks under two visibility conditions (CAVOK/CAT IIIA) while two different communication protocols (presence/absence of turning direction information) were adopted by the air traffic control officer (ATCOs). Electroencephalography (EEG) and the NASA Task Load Index were respectively used to reflect the pilot's mental state and to evaluate the pilot's mental workload subjectively. Results indicated that impaired visibility increases the subjective workload significantly, while the inclusion of turning direction information in the ATCO's instruction would not signifi- cantly intensify their cognitive workload. Mutual information was used to quantitatively assess the shared situational awareness between the pilot flying and the pilot monitoring. Finally, this research proposes a human - centred approach to identify potentially hazardous weather conditions from EEG power spectral densities with Bayesian neural networks (BNN). The classification model has outperformed other baseline algorithms with an accuracy of 66.5%, an F1 score of 61.4%, and an area under the ROC of 0.749. Using the concept of explainable AI with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values, the exploration of latent mental patterns formulates novel knowledge to gain insights into the vital physiological indicators of the pilots in response to different scenarios from the BNN model. In the long term, the model facilitates the decision regarding the necessity of providing automation and decision-making aids to pilots.","[Yiu, Cho Yin; Ng, Kam K.

There is a growing body of work that focuses on solving the challenges of transitioning pBCI systems from the research laboratory environment to practical, everyday use. An interesting issue is what impact methodological variability may have on the ability to reliably identify (neuro)physiological patterns that are useful for state assessment. This work aimed at quantifying the effects of methodological variability in a pBCI design for detecting changes in cognitive workload. Specific focus was directed toward the effects of replacing electrodes over dual sessions (thus inducing changes in placement, electromechanical properties, and/or impedance between the electrode and skin surface) on the accuracy of several machine learning approaches in a binary classification problem. In investigating these methodological variables, it was determined that the removal and replacement of the electrode suite between sessions does not impact the accuracy of a number of learning approaches when trained on one session and tested on a second. This finding was confirmed by comparing to a control group for which the electrode suite was not replaced between sessions. This result suggests that sensors (both neurological and peripheral) may be removed and replaced over the course of many interactions with a pBCI system without affecting its performance. Future work on multi-session and multi-day pBCI system use should seek to replicate this (lack of) effect between sessions in other tasks, temporal time courses, and data analytic approaches while also focusing on non-stationarity and variable classification performance due to intrinsic factors.","[Estepp, Justin R.; Christensen, James C.] Air Force Res Lab, Appl Neurosci Branch, Human Effectiveness Directorate, Human Performance Wing 711, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; US Air Force Research Laboratory,"Estepp, JR (corresponding author), Air Force Res Lab, Human Performance Wing 711, 711 HPW RHCP,BLDG 840,W200,2510 Fifth St, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.",justin.estepp@us.af.mil,,,Air Force Office of Scientific Research,Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)),"The authors would like to thank William D.

In this paper, NIRS was used to assess the cognitive processes of operators performing complex, safety-critical Air Traffic Control (ATC) tasks. The haemodynamic response in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) was obtained from an event-based analysis of the NIRS recordings. Despite the relative complexity of the experimental scenario, grand-averaged results from the analysis showed an evident Haemodynamic Response Function (HRF) in the right PFC, specifically for events in which the operator provided instructions to arriving aircraft (e.g., clear-to-land or go-around). The HRF peak was observed before the event, suggesting that maximum cognitive processing of the operator occurred before instructions were actually given.

The assessment of UAV controllers' performance thus their mental workload may be used to discriminate the level and type of automation required. The aim of this paper is to build a mental-workload prediction model based on UAV operators' cognitive demand to support the design of an adjustable autonomy supervisory system. A classification and validation procedure was performed to both categorize the cognitive workload measured by ElectroEncephaloGram signals and evaluate the obtained patterns from the point of view of accuracy. Then, a user study was carried out to identify critical workload conditions by evaluating operators' performance in accomplishing the assigned tasks.

This study shows the development of a combinative assessment for the evaluation of mental workload in a comparative analysis of two assembly task scenarios, without and with robot interaction. The evaluation of mental workload is achieved through a combination of subjective (NASA TLX) and real-time objective measurements. This latter measurement is found using an innovative electroencephalogram (EEG) device and the characterization of the cognitive workload through the brainwave power ratio beta/alpha, defined after the pre-processing phase of EEG data. Finally, observational analyses are considered regarding the task performance of the two scenarios. The statistical analyses show how significantly the mental workload diminution and a higher level of performance, as the number of components assembled correctly by the participants, are achieved in the scenario with the robot.","[Caiazzo, Carlo; Savkovic, Marija; Milojevic, Djordje; Djapan, Marko] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Engn, Sestre Janj 6, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia; [Pusica, Milos] mBrainTrain Doo, Savska 19 G, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Pusica, Milos; Leva, Maria Chiara] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Environm Hlth, Dublin D07ADY7, Ireland",University of Kragujevac,"Djapan, M (corresponding author), Univ Kragujevac, Fac Engn, Sestre Janj 6, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",carlocaiazzo@fink.rs; marija.savkovic@kg.ac.rs; milos.pusica@mbraintrain.com; djordjemilojevic@gmail.com; mariachiara.leva@tudublin.ie; djapan@kg.ac.rs,"Djapan, Marko/AFY-1607-2022; Pušica, Miloš/JZE-1252-2024","Leva, Maria Chiara/0000-0002-6770-8332; Djapan, Marko/0000-0002-8016-8422; Pusica, Milos/0009-0003-4522-6222","European Commission, HORIZON 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Training Network Collaborative Intelligence for Safety Critical Systems, CISC","European Commission, HORIZON 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Training Network Collaborative Intelligence for Safety Critical Systems, CISC","Authors acknowledge Ivan Macuzic, Full professor of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Kragujevac, Serbia, for the support and inspiration of this research study.",,78,3,3,6,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-1702,,MACHINES,Machines,NOV,2023,11,11,,,,,,,995,10.3390/machines11110995,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines11110995,,,20,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,Z7NR7,,gold,,,11/13/2024,WOS:001113910900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study sought to investigate the effects of co-pilot display engagement on drivers' visual workload, cognitive workload, and driving performance and offered a deeper insight into the design factors and task involvement of the co-pilot display. The study involved a driving simulator testing of 25 participants in five automobiles with a co-pilot display. Our analysis found increased driver visual workload and cognitive workload in the conditions of co-pilot display engagement. Participants exhibited more erratic driving behavior (standard deviation of speed and standard deviation of lane position) while the front passenger was watching a video. Furthermore, five linear mixed models were built to further analyze the effects of task type, screen size, screen layout, and task involvement on dependent measures.

Background: Fatigue may play an important role in the relationship between poor ergonomics and deficits in quality and productivity. However, well-controlled laboratory studies in this area have several limitations, including the lack of work relevance of fatigue exposures and lack of both physical and cognitive measures. There remains a need to understand the relationship between physical and cognitive fatigue and task performance at exposure levels relevant to realistic production or light precision work. Method: Errors and fatigue measures were tracked over the course of a micropipetting task. Fatigue responses from 10 measures and errors in pipetting technique, precision, and targeting were submitted to principal component analysis to descriptively analyze features and patterns. Results: Fatigue responses and error rates contributed to three principal components (PCs), accounting for 50.9% of total variance. Fatigue responses grouped within the three PCs reflected central and peripheral upper extremity fatigue, postural sway, and changes in oculomotor behavior. Conclusion: In an 8-hr light precision task, error rates shared similar patterns to both physical and cognitive fatigue responses, and/or increases in arousal level. Application: The findings provide insight toward the relationship between fatigue and operation system performance (e.g., errors). This study contributes to a body of literature documenting task errors and fatigue, reflecting physical (both central and peripheral) and cognitive processes.","[Yung, Marcus] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Manji, Rahim] Univ Waterloo, Ergon & Occupat Biomech Lab, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Wells, Richard P.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Kinesiol, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Yung, M (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Kinesiol, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",m4yung@uwaterloo.ca,,"Yung, Marcus/0000-0003-3192-1470",AUTO21 Network Centres of Excellence [A506-AWH]; CIHR Grant [MAT-9186],AUTO21 Network Centres of Excellence; CIHR Grant(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),The authors would like to acknowledge Joe Church for his contributions during data collection.

Fifty-eight L2 English learners performed simple and complex versions of an argumentative writing task manipulated along with resource-directing variables. The essays were first analysed for textual emotionality with sentiment analysis and then examined using a set of lexical and syntactic complexity and cohesiveness indices. Regarding emotionality, the complex task elicited more positive and negative emotions than the simple task. Further, the complex task led to greater lexical complexity and cohesiveness than the simple task, but the two tasks were not statistically different from each other in terms of syntactic complexity features. Varied patterns of correlations were observed between emotionality metrics and indices of different dimensions of linguistic complexity in the two tasks. Our findings focusing on the intersections of cognitive, socio-emotive, and linguistic components suggest that different task complexity manipulations could generate varying cognitive demands, affecting L2 written production. These findings provide theoretical and pedagogical implications for TBLT researchers and L2 writing practitioners.","[Tabari, Mahmoud Abdi] Univ Nevada, Dept English, 1664 north Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Lu, Xiaofei] Penn State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, State Coll, PA USA; [Wang, Yizhou] Univ Melbourne, Sch Languages & Linguist, Parkville, Australia",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University of Melbourne,"Tabari, MA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept English, 1664 north Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",mabditabari@unr.edu,"Wang, Yizhou/HTR-9263-2023; Lu, Xiaofei/H-8515-2019","Lu, Xiaofei/0000-0003-2365-2581; Wang, Yizhou/0000-0001-8269-180X; Abdi Tabari, Mahmoud/0000-0002-8022-5415",,,,,87,0,0,20,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-8416,1747-7565,,LANG AWARE,Lang.

However, in the laboratory setting, language control is often investigated using forced switching tasks, which result in significant performance costs. The present study assessed whether switching would be less costly when performed in a more natural fashion, and what factors might account for this. Mandarin English bilinguals engaged in language switching under three different contexts with varied task demands. We examined two factors which may be characteristic of natural switching: (i) freedom of language selection; (ii) consistency of language used to name each item. Participants' brain activities were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG), along with behavioural measures of reaction speed and accuracy. The natural context (with both free selection and consistent language use for each item) produced better performance overall, showing reduced mixing cost and no significant switch cost. The neural effect of language mixing was also reversed in this context, suggesting that freely mixing two languages was easier than staying in a single language. Further, while switching in the forced context elicited increased brain activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus, this switch effect disappeared when the language used to name each item was consistent. Together, these findings demonstrate that the two factors above conjointly contribute to eliminating significant performance costs and cognitive demands associated with language switching and mixing. Such evidence aligns with lexical selection models which do not assume bilingual production to be inherently effortful.","[Zhu, Judy D.; Sun, Yanan; Sowman, Paul F.] Macquarie Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Blanco-Elorrieta, Esti] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Szakay, Anita] Macquarie Univ, Dept Linguist, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Zhu, Judy D.; Blanco-Elorrieta, Esti; Sun, Yanan; Szakay, Anita; Sowman, Paul F.] Univ Sydney, Brain & Mind Ctr, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia",Macquarie University; Harvard University; Macquarie University; University of Sydney,"Zhu, JD (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",di.zhu@sydney.edu.au,"Zhu, Judy/JXN-2166-2024; Sowman, Paul/H-3352-2019; SUN, YANAN/L-8071-2019","Szakay, Anita/0000-0001-8124-0388; Blanco-Elorrieta, Esti/0000-0003-2983-5880; Zhu, Judy D./0000-0003-0958-6047; Sowman, Paul/0000-0002-3863-6675","Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders [CE110001021]; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship (RTP); Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship (MQRES); Dingwall Foundation dissertation award; Australian Research Council [DE130100868, DP170103148]",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders(Australian Research Council); Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship (RTP); Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship (MQRES); Dingwall Foundation dissertation award; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders [CE110001021] .

Because both processes access lexical and sublexical representations, it is commonly assumed that perception and production involve cooperative processes. However, few studies have directly examined the nature of the relationship between the two modalities, particularly how producing speech influences speech perception. In a series of experiments, we examine the counter-intuitive finding that learning perceptual representations can be disrupted by producing tokens during training. We investigate whether this disruption can be alleviated by prior experience with the speech sounds, and whether the cause of the disruption is production of the particular sound being learned, or is a more general conflict between the production system and the system that develops new perceptual representations. Our results paint a more competitive relationship between perception and production than might be assumed and suggest that both demands inherent to production and cognitive demands modulate this relationship.

The Manned-Unmanned Teaming concept involves low cost, attritable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that could be deployed along with a manned aircraft. The UAVs act as a complementary asset and bolster offensive air operations. Given the complexity of future operating environments, the degree of autonomous control required for pilots to concurrently operate multiple UAVs and their own aircraft is one area of concern. To determine the amount of autonomous control abstraction that has the largest impact in reducing operator workload and increasing system performance, a predictive workload model was developed using the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT). This research concluded that maned-unmanned teams can increase mission performance and maintain the pilot's cognitive workload at a manageable level by utilizing higher levels of human control abstraction, where unmanned systems have greater degree of autonomy.","[Andrews, Jinan M.; Rusnock, Chrstina F.; Miller, Michael E.] Air Force Inst Technol, Dept Syst & Engn Management, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; [Meador, Douglas P.] Air Force Res Lab, Air Force Mat Command, Wright Patterson AFB, OH USA",Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT); United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; US Air Force Research Laboratory,"Andrews, JM (corresponding author), Air Force Inst Technol, Dept Syst & Engn Management, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.",Jinan.Andrews@afit.edu; Christina.Rusnock@us.af.mil; Michael.Miller@afit.edu; Douglas.Meador@us.afit.edu,,"Miller, Michael/0000-0001-6306-3437",711th Human Performance Wing at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory,711th Human Performance Wing at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory,"The views in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Air Force, Department of Defense, nor the U.S. Government.

Although it might be not necessary to require the drivers to intervene on most occasions, it is still important to improve drivers' situation awareness (SA) in unexpected driving scenarios to improve their trust in and acceptance of AVs. In this study, we conceptualized SA at the levels of perception (SA L1), comprehension (SA L2), and projection (SA L3), and proposed an SA level-based explanation framework based on explainable AI. Then, we examined the effects of these explanations and their modalities on drivers' situational trust, cognitive workload, as well as explanation satisfaction. A three (SA levels: SA L1, SA L2 and SA L3) by two (explanation modalities: visual, visual + audio) between-subjects experiment was conducted with 340 par-ticipants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results indicated that by designing the explanations using the proposed SA-based framework, participants could redirect their attention to the important objects in the traffic and understand their meaning for the AV system. This improved their SA and filled the gap of understanding the correspondence of AV's behavior in the particular situations which also increased their situational trust in AV. The results showed that participants reported the highest trust with SA L2 explanations, although the mental workload was assessed higher in this level. The results also provided insights into the relationship between the amount of information in explanations and modalities, showing that participants were more satisfied with visual-only explanations in the SA L1 and SA L2 conditions and were more satisfied with visual and auditory explanations in the SA L3 condition. Finally, we found that the cognitive workload was also higher in SA L2, possibly because the participants were actively interpreting the results, consistent with a higher level of situational trust. These findings demonstrated that properly designed explanations, based on our proposed SA-based framework, had significant implications for explaining AV behavior in conditional and highly automated driving.","[Avetisyan, Lilit; Ayoub, Jackie; Zhou, Feng] Univ Michigan Dearborn, Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Dearborn, MI USA; [Zhou, Feng] 4901 Evergreen Rd, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan Dearborn,"Zhou, F (corresponding author), 4901 Evergreen Rd, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA.",fezhou@umich.edu,"Avetisyan, Lilit/JUU-3073-2023","Avetisyan, Lilit/0000-0003-4206-6385",,,,,44,14,14,9,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-8478,1873-5517,,TRANSPORT RES F-TRAF,Transp.

This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATE, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry: This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We test this hypothesis by comparing pronoun production in the L2 of nonbalanced Spanish-English bilinguals to that of English monolinguals in two cognitively challenging contexts. In Experiment 1, both monolinguals and bilinguals produced more explicit references when part of the information was unavailable to their addressee (privileged ground) than when all information was shared (common ground), evidencing audience design. In Experiment 2, verbal load led to more unspecified references than visual load and no load (an effect statistically indistinguishable between groups but numerically driven by the monolingual group). While bilinguals produced overall more pronouns than monolinguals in both experiments, there was no indication that bilinguals' referential choice was disproportionally affected by increased cognitive demand, contrary to the predictions of the Interface Hypothesis.","[Contemori, Carla; Ivanova, Iva] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Contemori, C (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",ccontemori@utep.edu,"Ivanova, Iva/AAQ-2587-2021","Contemori, Carla/0000-0003-4264-6750",,,,,61,5,5,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1366-7289,1469-1841,,BILING-LANG COGN,Biling.-Lang.

We asked whether the expected developmental trend across four age levels (6, 9, 13, and 17 years) was equally reflected in children's speech rate, articulation rate, and pausing (frequency, duration, and proportion of pauses), and how their speech tempo was modulated by the cognitive demands of different speaking tasks (spontaneous narratives, story retellings, and story generations). We found a systematic incremental increase in speech rate and articulation rate with each higher age level, but the corresponding decrease in the frequency, duration, and proportion of pauses was less systematic. Increased cognitive demands in the story generation and retelling tasks resulted in slower speech and articulation rates than in spontaneous narratives. The demands of different tasks were also reflected in a distinct pattern of pausing. Overall, the study suggests a protracted developmental time course of temporal control in narrative discourse production and underscores the importance of considering speaking contexts when comparing findings across experimental studies.

The results are based on cognitive ergonomics. The experiment used eye-tracking methods and a questionnaire to gather data. The independent variables were interface complexity and user background. Interface complexity had three levels: high interface complexity, moderate interface complexity and low interface complexity. User background had two levels: the novice group and the expert group. The dependent variables included time to first fixation, fixations before and subjective feelings. A total of 38 operators participated in the experiment, and the results showed that (1) interface complexity caused a significant difference in time to first fixation (P < 0.05) and fixations before (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the results revealed significant differences between high complexity interfaces compared to low complexity interfaces (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between moderate and low complexity interfaces or between moderate and high complexity interfaces (P > 0.05); (2) user background significantly affected the user experience; (3) within the same complexity level, expert operators' cognitive workload was significantly lower than that of novice operators; and (4) there was no significant relationship between the interface complexity and the user's background. The study concludes that because interface complexity has a significant effect on the time taken to locate the target button on the screen, interface design should be as simple as possible, while still providing the necessary level of functionality.","[Wu, Lei; Zhu, Zhijuan; Cao, Huai; Li, Bin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Wu, L (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.",lei.wu@hust.edu.cn,"lei, wu/N-8380-2013","lei, wu/0000-0002-3821-9839",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities HUST [2014QN017],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities HUST(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We thank our reviewers for their valuable and insightful comments.

This is often explained with reference to distinctiveness, arguing that aloud items become associated with distinctive sensorimotor features that facilitate retrieval at test. Based on this framework, more distinctive forms of production should result in larger production effects. The present study tested this theory by having participants study items silently or aloud in either their own voice or as a popular character. Participants were then tested for those items using recognition memory. Relative to silent items, aloud items read in the participants' own voice demonstrated a typical production effect; however, contrary to any predictions, no production effect was observed for the character voices. We next manipulated how frequently the character voice was used relative to the participants' own voice. This revealed a production effect for character voices only when those voices were more common than the participant's own voice. This pattern could not be attributed to cognitive demands or performance anxiety but was predicted by a novel computational account based on the Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) model. Our results show that the relation between distinctiveness and memory is not necessarily linear.","[Wakeham-Lewis, Rachelle M.; Fawcett, Jonathan M.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Psychol, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; [Ozubko, Jason] SUNY Coll Geneseo, Dept Psychol, Geneseo, NY 14454 USA",Memorial University Newfoundland; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Geneseo,"Fawcett, JM (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Psychol, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada.",jfawcett@mun.ca,,"Ozubko, Jason/0000-0003-0351-0957",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),JMF was funded by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant.,,45,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-8211,1464-0686,,MEMORY,Memory,26-Nov,2022,30,10,,,,,1319,1333,,10.1080/09658211.2022.2115075,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09658211.2022.2115075,,22-Aug,15,"Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology,5L6HN,36107805,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000854149500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Experiment 1, participants directly interacted in English conversations with audio-visually recorded confederates. In Experiment 2, participants observed recorded conversations among confederates. In both conversational situations, source memory was more accurate than destination memory, indicating that the attentional resources consumed by self-focus or sentence production/completion do not explain why destinations are less well remembered than sources in direct-interaction conversations. Source and destination memory were positively associated with item memory at the participant level, indicating that stronger item encoding is associated with stronger encoding of contextual information. In the observed conversations, source and destination accuracy were negatively associated at the trial level, indicating that these features of the memory episode are not encoded independently, and there is a tradeoff in the encoding of these contextual features. Item memory did not differ for monolinguals and bilinguals and was positively associated with proficiency only in conversations with direct interaction. In the observational setting (but not the direct-interaction setting), source and destination memory were more accurate for bilinguals than monolinguals. This finding suggests that bilinguals allocate attention more efficiently than monolinguals when the cognitive demands of sentence production are eliminated. Proficiency in English was positively associated with memory for the appropriate conversational partner only when participants had to produce sentence frames and complete them with self-generated information, suggesting that language proficiency is beneficial when cognitive demands are high.","[Tsuboi, Naoko; Francis, Wendy S.] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Psychol, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Francis, WS (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Psychol, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",nao.tsuboi5@gmail.com; wfrancis@utep.edu,,,Graduate School Dodson Research Grant; Les and Harriet Dodson Endowment at the University of Texas at El Paso,Graduate School Dodson Research Grant; Les and Harriet Dodson Endowment at the University of Texas at El Paso,"This research was supported by the Graduate School Dodson Research Grant provided by the Les and Harriet Dodson Endowment at the University of Texas at El Paso and is based on the first author's dissertation.

More recently, several studies have considered whether language production or comprehension is inherently more difficult with respect to costs on concurrent performance, with mixed results. This assessment is particularly difficult given the open question of how one should best equate and compare production and comprehension demands and performance. The present study used 2 very different approaches to address this question. Experiment 1 assessed manual tracking performance concurrently with a conventional labouratory task, comparing dual-task costs with comprehension and verification versus production of category items. Experiment 2 adopted an extreme ecological and functional approach to this question by assessing dual-task manual tracking costs concurrent with continuous, naturalistic, 2-way conversation, allowing event-related analysis of continuous tracking relative to onsets and offsets of natural production and comprehension events. Over both experiments, tracking performance was worse with concurrent production versus comprehension demands. We suggest that by at least 1 important functional metric-performance in natural, everyday conversation-talking is indeed harder than listening.","[Lee, April M.

Purpose: To investigate the ergonomic advantages and disadvantages of employing a collaborative robotics framework that intentionally imposes variability in the robot's behavior to stimulate the human partner's psychophysical state. Methods: A review of overassistance within human-robot collaboration and methods of addressing this phenomenon via adaptive automation. In adaptive approaches, the robot assistance may even challenge the user to better achieve a long-term objective while partially conflicting with their short-term task goals. Common themes across these approaches were extracted to motivate and support the proposed idea of stimulating robot behavior in physical human-robot collaboration. Results: Experimental evidence to justify stimulating robot behavior is presented through a human-robot handover study. A robot handover policy that regularly injects variability into the object transfer location led to significantly larger dynamics in the torso rotations and center of mass of human receivers compared to an overassistive policy that constrains receiver motion. Crucially, the stimulating handover policy also generated improvements in widely used ergonomics risk indicators of human posture. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the potential ergonomic benefits of a cobot's actions imposing variability in a user's responsive behavior, rather than indirectly restricting human behavior by optimizing the immediate task objective. Therefore, a transition from cobot policies that optimize instantaneous measures of ergonomics to those that continuously engage users could hold promise for human-robot collaboration in occupational settings characterized by repeated interactions.","[Zolotas, Mark; Bazzi, Salah; Saha, Dipanjan; Padir, Taskin] Northeastern Univ, Inst Expt Robot, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Luo, Rui; Padir, Taskin] Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA USA; [Mabulu, Katiso] Northeastern Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Boston, MA USA; [Kloeckl, Kristian] Northeastern Univ, Dept Art??Design, Boston, MA USA; [Kloeckl, Kristian] Northeastern Univ, Sch Architecture, Boston, MA USA",Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University,"Zolotas, M (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Inst Expt Robot, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",m.zolotas@northeastern.edu,"Padir, Taskin/AAF-5524-2020; Zolotas, Mark/Y-5893-2019","Zolotas, Mark/0000-0002-7672-940X",National Science Foundation [1928654],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. 1928654.,,47,1,1,6,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2472-5838,2472-5846,,IISE T OCCUP ERG HUM,IISE Trans.

For this collaboration to be effective, human operators must appropriately trust the agent(s) they are interacting with. Multiple factors influence trust, such as the context of interaction, prior experiences with automated systems and the quality of the help offered by agents in terms of its transparency and performance. Most of the literature on trust in automation identified the performance of the agent as a key factor influencing trust. However, other work has shown that the behavior of the agent, type of the agent's errors, and predictability of the agent's actions can influence the likelihood of the user's reliance on the agent and efficiency of tasks completion. Our work focuses on how agents' predictability affects cognitive load, performance and users' trust in a real-time human-agent collaborative task. We used an interactive aiming task where participants had to collaborate with different agents that varied in terms of their predictability and performance. This setup uses behavioral information (such as task performance and reliance on the agent) as well as standardized survey instruments to estimate participants' reported trust in the agent, cognitive load and perception of task difficulty. Thirty participants took part in our lab-based study. Our results showed that agents with more predictable behaviors have a more positive impact on task performance, reliance and trust while reducing cognitive workload. In addition, we investigated the human-agent trust relationship by creating models that could predict participants' trust ratings using interaction data. We found that we could reliably estimate participants' reported trust in the agents using information related to performance, task difficulty and reliance. This study provides insights on behavioral factors that are the most meaningful to anticipate complacent or distrusting attitudes toward automation. With this work, we seek to pave the way for the development of trust-aware agents capable of responding more appropriately to users by being able to monitor components of the human-agent relationships that are the most salient for trust calibration.","[Daronnat, Sylvain; Azzopardi, Leif; Halvey, Martin; Dubiel, Mateusz] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Daronnat, S (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",sylvain.daronnat@strath.ac.uk,,"Dubiel, Mateusz/0000-0001-8250-3370; Daronnat, Sylvain/0000-0002-4779-9601","Thales company; department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Strathclyde [1293-CA-07062017, S170825-101]",Thales company(Thales Group); department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Strathclyde,"This work has been funded by the Thales company and the department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Strathclyde under the agreement 1293-CA-07062017, identifier S170825-101.",,55,12,12,6,36,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

The results showed that mental workload of the participants increased as the task load increased and their performance decreased. It was observed that the developed Artificial Neural Network model can predict operator mental workload based on eye response indices (accuracy: 79.2%). This study is considered to contribute to the literature by defining an upper redline of task demands for an operator and monitoring near real-time mental workload indicators based on the physiological data of operators in the presence of autonomous ships and in navigational conditions where the automation level of ships gradually increases.","[Ozsever, B.] Piri Reis Univ, Maritime Fac, Istanbul, Turkey; [Tavacioglu, L.] Istanbul Tech Univ, Maritime Fac, Istanbul, Turkey",Piri Reis University; Istanbul Technical University,"Özsever, B (corresponding author), Piri Reis Univ, Maritime Fac, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Tavacioglu, Leyla/ABB-1898-2020","Ozsever, Baris/0000-0003-4926-2477",Scientific Research Projects Department of Istanbul Technical University [41710],Scientific Research Projects Department of Istanbul Technical University(Istanbul Technical University),This study is part of PhD thesis of first author and was supported by Scientific Research Projects Department of Istanbul Technical University.

The purpose of FC of highways is to ensure that national and state highway systems provide both mobility and accessibility for the public. The system created has worked reasonably well over the course of the last 100 years. But problems are occurring and it is time to consider new ways to implement road classification systems. The 1921 legislation established a national system of highways which included a federal aid and primary system for the United States. The national system has greatly enhanced users' ability to travel long distances by land and to move products from the factory and farm to customers throughout the U.S. much more quickly and cheaply than before. But times have changed and economic growth is being threatened by delays in adding to, improving, and modifying the 3.5 million mi highway network. Both urban and rural daily traffic delays are common. Modification and changing FC of roads take years to finalize. Progress must be improved for continued national transportation success, local growth, and world competitiveness. But even with the willingness to make enhancements in how FCs are managed and modernized, the question is, can the U.S. continue its national economic success? This article will describe two recommendations that if implemented will ensure continued transportation growth and success while taking into account the needs of users at all road levels.","[Tignor, Samuel C.] Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Tignor, SC (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",stignor@aol.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

Determining whether humans are threatening is a particular challenge to which future autonomous systems may contribute. Optimal trust calibration is critical for mission success, but most trust research has addressed conventional automated systems of limited intelligence. This article identifies multiple factors that may influence trust in autonomous systems. Trust may be undermined by various sources of demand and uncertainty. These include the cognitive demands resulting from the complexity and unpredictability of the system, social demands resulting from the system's capacity to function as a team-member, and self-regulative demands associated with perceived threats to personal competence. It is proposed that existing gaps in trust research may be addressed using simulation methodologies. A simulated environment developed by the research team is described. It represents a town-clearing task in which the human operator teams with a robot that can be equipped with various sensors, and software for intelligent analysis of sensor data. The functionality of the simulator is illustrated, together with future research directions.","[Matthews, Gerald; Lin, Jinchao] Univ Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Panganiban, April Rose; Bailey, Rachel] Air Force Res Lab, Wright Patterson AFB, OH USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; United States Department of Defense; United States Air Force; US Air Force Research Laboratory,"Matthews, G (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Inst Simulat & Training, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",gmatthews@ist.ucf.edu; april_rose.fallon@us.af.mil; rachel.bailey.8.ctr@us.af.mil; jlin@ist.ucf.edu,,,US Air Force Research Laboratory; US Army Research Laboratory,US Air Force Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory); US Army Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from US Air Force Research Laboratory and US Army Research Laboratory.

Lack of convergence of subjective scales with physiological and performance-based measures calls into question whether there is any unitary workload construct that underpins conscious experience, physiological state and the individual's profile of task-related performance. We examine philosophical and measurement perspectives on the divergence problem, and we consider three possible solutions. First, difficulties in reliable and valid measurement of workload may contribute to divergence but do not fully explain it. Second, workload may be treated operationally: use of specific measures is justified by demonstrating their pragmatic utility in predicting important outcomes. Third, further efforts may be made to develop representational workload measurements that correspond to real empirical phenomena. Application of formal standards for test validity can identify multiple latent constructs supporting subjective workload, including those defining self-regulation in performance contexts. Physiological and performance-based assessments may define additional, distinct constructs. A resolution of the diversity issue is crucial for ergonomics since the invalid application of workload measurement will threaten exposed operators as well as many others who are served by the complex technological systems they control.","[Matthews, Gerald; Hancock, P.

A second experiment evaluated the influence of task load and informational message type (i.e. single words vs. grouped phrases) on that same collaborative task. In both experiments, the relationship of personal characteristics (attentional control and spatial ability) to performance and workload was also measured. In addition to objective performance and self-report of cognitive load, we evaluated different physiological responses in each experiment. Results showed a performance-workload association for directional cues, message type and task load. EEG measures however, proved generally insensitive to such task load manipulations. Where significant EEG effects were observed, right hemisphere amplitude differences predominated, although unexpectedly these latter relationships were negative. Although EEG measures were partially associated with performance, they appear to possess limited utility as measures of workload in association with tactile displays. Practitioner Summary: As practitioners look to take advantage of innovative tactile displays in complex operational realms like human-robotic interaction, associated performance effects are mediated by cognitive workload. Despite some patterns of association, reliable reflections of operator state can be difficult to discern and employ as the number, complexity and sophistication of these respective measures themselves increase.","[Reinerman-Jones, L.; Barber, D.

Unfortunately, these systems appear like a 'black-box' to users due to their complex working mechanisms and therefore significantly affect the user's trust in human-machine interactions. This is partly due to the tightly coupled uncertainty inherent in the ML models that underlie the predictive decision making recommendations. Furthermore, when such analytics-driven intelligent systems are used in modern complex high-risk domains (such as aviation)-user decisions, in addition to trust, are also influenced by higher levels of cognitive load. This paper investigates effects of uncertainty and cognitive load on user trust in predictive decision making in order to design effective user interfaces for such ML-based intelligent systems. Our user study of 42 subjects in a repeated factorial design experiment found that both uncertainty types (risk and ambiguity) and cognitive workload levels affected user trust in predictive decision making. Uncertainty presentation leads to increased trust but only under low cognitive load conditions when users had sufficient cognitive resources to process the information. Presentation of uncertainty under high load conditions (when cognitive resources were short in supply) leads to a decrease of trust in the system and its recommendations.","[Zhou, Jianlong; Arshad, Syed Z.; Luo, Simon; Chen, Fang] CSIRO, DATA61, 13 Garden St, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Zhou, JL (corresponding author), CSIRO, DATA61, 13 Garden St, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia.",jianlong.zhou@data61.csiro.au; syed.arshad@data61.csiro.au; simon.luo@data61.csiro.au; fang.chen@data61.csiro.au,"Chen, Fang/JZE-4446-2024; Zhou, Jianlong/AGV-6879-2022","Zhou, Jianlong/0000-0001-6034-644X; Chen, Fang/0000-0003-4971-8729; Luo, Simon/0000-0002-7660-2230",Asian Office of Aerospace Research & Development (AOARD) [FA2386-14-1-0022 AOARD 134131],Asian Office of Aerospace Research & Development (AOARD),Authors thank all volunteer participants for the experiment.

According to Robinson's Cognition Hypotheses (2001a, 2005, 2007), the production of language would be different when certain manipulation of task complexity was made. The tasks were manipulated following two variables from the Cognition Hypotheses, along resource-directing (+/- causal reasoning demand) and resource-dispersing (+/- task structure) dimensions. Eighty-eight undergraduate students from one of the technical universities in Malaysia were divided into four groups and assigned with a writing task. After the participants have completed the writing tasks, they were interviewed and asked to complete a questionnaire to gauge their motivation towards the tasks. Participants' written language production was coded and analyzed using syntactic and lexical complexity measures. Further analysis of the data was conducted using Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and correlational analysis. Analyses of the results showed that there is a correlation between task complexity and task motivation among learners. However, the correlation is only evident in lexical complexity production and no correlation was found for any of the syntactic complexity measures. This study is significant as it explores the roles of task complexity and task motivation in mediating the production of language. It also highlights how the manipulation of task complexity would encourage the production of the language in terms of its complexity.","[Masrom, Umi Kalsom] Univ Tenaga Nas, Shah Alam, Malaysia; [Alwi, Nik Aloesnita Nik Mohd] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Gambang, Pahang, Malaysia; [Daud, Nor Shidrah Mat] Univ Teknol MARA, Acad Language Studies, Dept Language & Linguist, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA); Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Masrom, UK (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",kalsom@uniten.edu.my; aloesnita@ump.edu.my; norshidrah@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Daud, Nor/P-2626-2018","Masrom, Umi Kalsom/0000-0002-4071-7618",,,,,52,4,5,0,24,PENERBIT UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,BANGI,"PENERBIT UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA, FAC SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES, BANGI, SELANGOR 43600, MALAYSIA",1675-8021,,,GEMA ONLINE J LANG S,GEMA Online J.

Collaborative robots (cobots) can potentially reduce physical stress, but fully autonomous implementation has been particularly challenging due to skill, task variability, and robot limitations. CSC is an HRC method where the robot operates semi-autonomously while the human provides real-time corrections.Methods Twenty laboratory participants removed paint using an orbital sander, both manually and with a CSC robot. A fully automated robot was also tested.Results The CSC robot improved subjective discomfort compared to manual sanding in the upper arm by 29.5%, lower arm by 32%, hand by 36.5%, front of the shoulder by 24%, and back of the shoulder by 17.5%. Muscle fatigue measured using EMG, was observed in the medial deltoid and flexor carpi radialis for the manual condition. The composite cognitive workload on the NASA-TLX increased by 14.3% for manual sanding due to high physical demand and effort, while mental demand was 14% greater for the CSC robot. Digital imaging showed that the CSC robot outperformed the automated condition by 7.16% for uniformity, 4.96% for quantity, and 6.06% in total.Conclusions In this example, we found that human skills and techniques were integral to sanding and can be successfully incorporated into HRC systems. Humans performed the task using the CSC robot with less fatigue and discomfort.Applications The results can influence implementation of future HRC systems in manufacturing environments.","[Konstant, Anna] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Ind & Syst Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Orr, Nitzan] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Masters Res, Madison, WI USA; [Hagenow, Michael; Gundrum, Isabelle] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Hu, Yu Hen] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Elect & Comp Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Mutlu, Bilge; Gleicher, Michael] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Comp Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Zinn, Michael] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Mech Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Radwin, Robert G.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Coll Engn, Madison, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Radwin, RG (corresponding author), Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 1550 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",rradwin@wisc.edu,"Radwin, Robert/IWM-0218-2023; Radwin, Robert/K-1340-2017","Gleicher, Michael/0000-0003-3295-4071; Radwin, Robert/0000-0002-7973-0641",NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI); Boeing Company [80NSSC19M0124],NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI); Boeing Company,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI) grant awarded to UW-Madison and The Boeing Company (Cooperative Agreement # 80NSSC19M0124).",,45,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Participants performed a writing-to-dictation task involving irregular words (e.g., choir), plausible nonwords (e.g., kroid), and a control task of drawing familiar geometric shapes (e.g., squares). Written production of both irregular words and nonwords engaged a left hemisphere perisylvian network associated with reading/spelling and phonological processing skills. Effects of lexicality, manifested by increased activation during nonword relative to irregular word spelling, were noted in anterior perisylvian regions (posterior inferior frontal gyrus/operculum/precentral gyrus/insula), and in left ventral occipito-temporal cortex. In addition to enhanced neural responses within domain-specific components of the language network, the increased cognitive demands associated with spelling nonwords engaged domain-general frontoparietal cortical networks involved in selective attention and executive control.

A main aspect of NOVA is the possibility of applying semi-supervised active learning where Machine Learning techniques are used already during the annotation process by giving the possibility to pre-label data automatically. Furthermore, NOVA implements recent eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide users with both, a confidence value of the automatically predicted annotations, as well as visual explanations. We investigate how such techniques can assist non-experts in terms of trust, perceived self-efficacy, cognitive workload as well as creating correct mental models about the system by conducting a user study with 53 participants. The results show that NOVA can easily be used by non-experts and lead to a high computer self-efficacy. Furthermore, the results indicate that XAI visualisations help users to create more correct mental models about the machine learning system compared to the baseline condition. Nevertheless, we suggest that explanations in the field of AI have to be more focused on user-needs as well as on the classification task and the model they want to explain.","[Heimerl, Alexander; Weitz, Katharina; Baur, Tobias; Andre, Elisabeth] Augsburg Univ, Lab Human Ctr AI, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",,"Heimerl, A (corresponding author), Augsburg Univ, Lab Human Ctr AI, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",heimerl@hcm-lab.de; weitz@hcm-lab.de; baur@hcm-lab.de; andre@hcm-lab.de,"Andre, Elisabeth/AAW-4960-2021; Weitz, Katharina/AAV-6328-2020","Andre, Elisabeth/0000-0002-2367-162X",DFG [392401413]; Bavarian Ministry of Science and Arts,DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Bavarian Ministry of Science and Arts,"This work was supported by DFG under project number 392401413, DEEP.

The aim of the study was to assess how AD impacts motor features in signature execution through kinematic analysis. The study included 10 individuals with mild AD, 10 individuals with moderate AD and 10 healthy controls matched by age, education and gender. Eight hybrid signatures were collected from each participant using a digitizer and NeuroScript's MovAlyzeR (R) software. The study revealed no statistically significant intergroup differences regarding average absolute velocity, absolute jerk, normalized jerk and average pen pressure in the text-based that were produced. Findings suggest that, in text-based signatures, motor features are relatively preserved in the initial and moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, at these stages of the illness, FHEs should not expect significant changes in such features for this signature type. These results also support the hypothesis that motor programs responsible for the creation/execution of text-based signatures are not significantly impaired in the initial and moderate stages of the illness, due to the automation and lower cognitive demands of well-trained signatures.","[Fernandes, Carina; Montalvo, Gemma] Univ Alcala, Inst Univ Invest Ciencias Policiales, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Fernandes, Carina] NCForenses Inst, Porto, Portugal; [Pertsinakis, Michael] Chartoularios PC Inst Questioned Document Studies, Athens, Greece; [Pertsinakis, Michael] MBS Coll Crete, Iraklion, Greece; [Pertsinakis, Michael] City Unity Coll, Athens, Greece; [Guimaraes, Joana] Univ Med, Fac Med, Porto, Portugal",Universidad de Alcala; Universidade do Porto,"Fernandes, C (corresponding author), Univ Alcala, Inst Univ Invest Ciencias Policiales, Alcala De Henares, Spain.;Fernandes, C (corresponding author), NCForenses Inst, Porto, Portugal.",cafernandes@ncforenses.pt,"Guimarães, Joana/IXD-8762-2023; Fernandes, Carina/JRY-7239-2023","Pereira Fernandes, Carina/0000-0002-2787-5419",,,,,16,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-19744-4; 978-3-031-19745-1,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2022,13424,,,,,,349,354,,10.1007/978-3-031-19745-1_26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-19745-1_26,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Neurosciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Neurosciences & Neurology,BU5IL,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000913319000026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pilots' abilities to divide their visual attention effectively during critical flight maneuvers play a central role in their situation awareness and decision-making. Given that a large number of visual cues in the flight deck need to be processed by the human eyes, there is an opportunity to utilize eye tracking in the analytics of pilot performance. To this end, we present a case study involving 10 licensed pilots in a simulated flight takeoff scenario and demonstrate that specific gaze behaviors employed by a pilot may lead to varying levels of success. In particular, pilots who perform better during the climb phase may often exhibit faster visual searches, and those who perform better during the takeoff phase may often scan a larger area of the visual scene. Also, more successful pilots tend to report lower cognitive workload that is further supported by their pupil diameters in the experiment. This knowledge may be utilized in the development of user models to infer pilot success and failure, whereby an intelligent flight deck can adapt system behaviors to the pilot, whereby alerts, warnings, and automation may be initiated in the event of detecting irregularity in pilots' gaze.","[Fu, Bo; Soriano, Angelo Ryan; Chu, Kayla; Gatsby, Peter; Guardado, Nicolas Guardado] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Fu, B (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",Bo.Fu@csulb.edu; angeloryan.soriano@stu-dent.csulb.edu; kayla.chu@student.csulb.edu; peter.gatsby01@student.csulb.edu; guardado@student.csulb.edu,,,,,,,29,0,0,3,3,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0466-6,,,,2024,,,,,,,170,175,,10.1145/3631700.3664871,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3631700.3664871,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX2KL,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:001263797000034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transparency in agents' behaviors is the key for such comprehension, which may be obtained by embedding a self-explanation ability into the agent to explain its own behaviors. Previous studies have relied on searching for the executed functions and logics to generate explanations for behaviors of goal-following logic-based agents. With the increasing number of functions and logics, current methods, such as component and process-based methods, have become impractical. This article proposes a new method exploiting the agent's artificial situation awareness states for generating explanations that involves several techniques: A Bayesian network, fuzzy theory, and Hamming distance. Our new method is evaluated in a collaborative driving context, in which a significant number of accidents recently occurred around the globe due to the lack of understanding of the autopilot agents. Using an autonomous driving simulator called Carla, two typical scenarios in collaborative driving, namely, traffic light and overtaking situations, are used. The findings show that the new method potentially reduces the search space in generating explanations and exhibits better computational performance and a lower cognitive workload. This work is important to calibrate human trust and to enhance comprehension of the agent.","[Kridalukmana, Rinta] Diponegoro Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Fac Engn, Kota Semarang 50275, Jawa Tengah, Indonesia; [Lu, Haiyan; Naderpour, Mohsen] Univ Technol Sydney, Australian Artificial Intelligence Inst, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Lu, Haiyan; Naderpour, Mohsen] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Diponegoro University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Kridalukmana, R (corresponding author), Diponegoro Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Fac Engn, Kota Semarang 50275, Jawa Tengah, Indonesia.",rintakrida@ce.undip.ac.id; haiyan.lu@uts.edu.au; mohsen.naderpour@uts.edu.au,"Naderpour, Mohsen/Q-1990-2016; Kridalukmana, Rinta/ABB-2148-2021","Kridalukmana, Rinta/0000-0003-3797-0134; Naderpour, Mohsen/0000-0002-3549-3875",LPDP Indonesia; Australian Government Research Training Program,LPDP Indonesia; Australian Government Research Training Program(Australian Government),This work was supported in part by both LPDP Indonesia and the Australian Government Research Training Program.,,45,2,2,6,35,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2291,2168-2305,,IEEE T HUM-MACH SYST,IEEE T.

Given that a rise in pitch frequently occurs in response to increased mental effort, we explore the link between higher pitch at the beginning of an utterance and the cognitive demands of sentence planning for speech production. To modulate the cognitive resources available for generating a message in a visual world speech production task, the study implemented a dual-task paradigm. Participants described pictures depicting events with multiple actors. In one-half of these descriptions, the participants memorized three nouns, later recalling them and answering related questions. The results demonstrate both cognitive and linguistic influences on sentence intonation. Specifically, intonation peaks at the beginning of longer utterances were higher than in shorter ones, and they were lower under the condition of memory load than under no load. Measurements of eye gaze indicated a very short processing delay at the outset of processing the picture and the sentence, which was rapidly overcome by the start of speech. The short time frame of restricted cognitive resources thus was manifested in the lowering of the intonation peaks. These findings establish a novel link between language-related memory span and sentence intonation and warrant further study to investigate the cognitive mechanisms of the planning of intonation.","[Ots, Nele] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Ots, N (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",ots@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Ots, Nele/0000-0002-4660-434X",Fritz Thyssen Stiftung [10.18.2.040SL],Fritz Thyssen Stiftung,"Support for projects from the Fritz Thyssen Stiftung (Planning sentences and sentence intonation cross-linguistically, 10.18.2.040SL) The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,85,0,0,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,10-Oct,2024,19,10,,,,,,,e0311125,10.1371/journal.pone.0311125,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311125,,,35,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,J4O5R,39388413,"gold, Green Accepted",,,11/13/2024,WOS:001336875300055,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is also crucial to mitigate the cognitive workload induced on the operator during cooperation. Indeed, a high level of stress can negatively affect the human capabilities, thus compromising the performance of the working dyad. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm where the robot is enabled to adapt its behavior online to simultaneously optimize in real-time the human physiological stress and productivity. The proposed control strategy exploits a game theoretic approach to model and locally estimate the state of collaboration in terms of human productivity and stress. Based on this estimate, a learning automaton suitably adjusts the production pace of the robot, thus influencing the dynamics of the cooperation. The proposed method was tested on a realistic collaborative assembly task. The results demonstrated that the novel control strategy effectively enhances the productivity of the human-robot team, while significantly mitigating the stress induced in the operator.","[Messeri, Costanza; Masotti, Gabriele; Zanchettin, Andrea Maria; Rocco, Paolo] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Messeri, C (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",costanza.messeri@mail.polimi.it; gabriele.masotti@mail.polimi.it; andreamaria.zanchettin@polimi.it; paolo.rocco@polimi.it,,"ROCCO, PAOLO/0000-0001-6716-434X; Masotti, Gabriele/0000-0001-5544-7190; Messeri, Costanza/0000-0002-1583-9699; Zanchettin, Andrea Maria/0000-0002-1866-7482",,,,,27,19,20,1,33,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2377-3766,,,IEEE ROBOT AUTOM LET,IEEE Robot.

Compared to the classical experiment where a plastic rubber hand was used, a realistic 3D representation was chosen to create the same illusion this time in both immersive virtual reality and augmented reality. Experiments were performed on 30 volunteers undergoing testing session composed of three stages. Participants were asked to complete two different questionnaires, one measuring their cognitive workload and another one regarding their experience with the rubber hand illusion. In addition, EEG signals of the individuals were recorded, resulting in 90 electroencephalogram datasets. Results indicate correlations between ownership statements with beta and gamma electroencephalogram bands in premotor cortex activity. Link between higher gamma production in ventral premotor area during the illusion was established in previous studies.","[Skola, Filip; Liarokapis, Fotis] Masaryk Univ, Fac Informat, HCI Lab, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Skola, F (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Informat, HCI Lab, Brno, Czech Republic.",xskola@mail.muni.cz; liarokap@mail.muni.cz,"Liarokapis, Fotis/AAD-4444-2019; Škola, Filip/AAG-1888-2020; Liarokapis, Fotis/B-7464-2014","Liarokapis, Fotis/0000-0003-3617-2261; Skola, Filip/0000-0003-4690-6687",,,,,44,21,22,2,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0178-2789,1432-2315,,VISUAL COMPUT,Visual Comput.,JUN,2016,32,8-Jun,,,,,761,770,,10.1007/s00371-016-1246-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00371-016-1246-8,,,10,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,DP8ET,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000378731600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

While several mental workload studies have compared the mental workload perceived by groups of experienced participants to that perceived by novice groups, no comparisons have been made between the same individuals performing the same tasks at different times. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to compare NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) toWorkload Profile (WP) in terms of their sensitivity. The comparison considers the impact of experience and task differentiation in the same individual once a degree of experience has been developed in the execution of the same tasks. It also considers the acceptability and intrusivity of the techniques. METHODS: The sample consisted of 30 participants who performed four tasks in two sessions. The first session was performed when participants had no experience; the second session was performed after a time of practice. Mental workload was assessed after each session. Statistical methods were used to compare the results. RESULTS: The NASA-TLX proved to be more sensitive to experience, while the WP showed greater sensitivity to task differentiation. In addition, while both techniques featured a similar degree of intrusivity, the NASA-TLX received greater acceptability. CONCLUSION: The acceptability of WP is low due to the high complexity of its dimensions and clarifying explanations of these may be necessary to increase acceptability. Future research proposals should be expanded to consider mental workload when designing work environments in current manufacturing environments.","[Barajas-Bustillos, Manuel A.] Technol Inst Ciudad Juarez, Ind Engn Dept, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; [Maldonado-Macias, Aide Aracely] Autonomous Univ Ciudad Juarez UACJ, Inst Engn & Technol, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; [Serrano-Rosa, Miguel Angel] Univ Valencia, Fac Psychol, Valencia, Spain; [Hernandez-Arellano, Juan Luis; Balderrama-Armendariz, Omar] Autonomous Univ Ciudad Juarez UACJ, Architecture Design & Art Inst, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; [Llamas-Alonso, Luis] Autonomous Univ Ciudad Juarez UACJ, Inst Social Sci & Humanities, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez; University of Valencia; Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez; Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez,"Maldonado-Macías, AA (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Ciudad Juarez UACJ, Inst Engn & Technol, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico.",,"Llamas Alonso, Luis Angel/ADV-9515-2022; Maldonado-Macías, Aide/AAP-5002-2020; Serrano, Miguel-Angel/ABE-7279-2021; Maldonado-Macias, Aide Aracely/E-3527-2017; Barajas-Bustillos, Manuel Alejandro/K-8041-2018","Maldonado-Macias, Aide Aracely/0000-0002-4959-161X; Barajas-Bustillos, Manuel Alejandro/0000-0003-1155-1847; Llamas-Alonso, Luis/0000-0002-4736-769X",,,,,34,0,0,2,7,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1051-9815,1875-9270,,WORK,Work,,2023,75,4,,,,,1265,1275,,10.3233/WOR-211324,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/WOR-211324,,,11,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",P9VC2,36710696,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:001054074600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: Discourse samples of the story of Cinderella elicited from Aphasia-Bank were analyzed with speech analysis software. Participants comprised people with latent and anomic aphasia as well as neurotypical controls (10 per group). Durations of pauses (silent and filled) were analyzed according to (a) the location they occurred (between or within sentences), (b) the syntactic complexity of sentences (simple, complex), and (c) sentence length (number of words). Statistical comparisons were conducted using mixed-effect models. Results: The two clinical groups (latent and anomic) differed from controls in the duration of pauses, both between and within sentences. Syntactic complexity did not exert an effect on either of the two clinical groups as compared with controls. As compared with controls, both clinical groups paused more before long in comparison with short sentences. Conclusion: Reduction in processing speed, which affects the ability to simultaneously maintain multiple linguistic and other cognitive demands associated with planning and monitoring of utterances, is a major factor that compromises sentence production in spoken discourse in latent aphasia.","[Salis, Christos] Newcastle Univ, Speech & Language Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [DeDe, Gayle] Temple Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Newcastle University - UK; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Salis, C (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Speech & Language Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",christos.salis@ncl.ac.uk,,"Salis, Christos/0000-0002-7212-127X",,,,,100,5,5,0,3,AMER SPEECH-LANGUAGE-HEARING ASSOC,ROCKVILLE,"2200 RESEARCH BLVD, #271, ROCKVILLE, MD 20850-3289 USA",1058-0360,1558-9110,,AM J SPEECH-LANG PAT,Am.

These tasks vary in cognitive complexity, ranging from low-level sensory processing to high-level decision making. Cognitive load, a measure of the effort required by the working memory, can serve as an indicator of tasks that may have higher risk of error. Task decomposition models for cognitive complexity can be combined with objective and subjective measures of workload to measure human performance in response to control room stimuli. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a cognitive task analysis approach to structure the design of experiments for the purpose of evaluating human performance in control room simulated use activities. Participants completed monitoring tasks in a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control room that required the completion of tasks ranging in cognitive complexity. Performance measures taken during the study were used to validate the breakdown of tasks complexity, and to identify potential sources of human error in workstation monitoring tasks. These findings can be linked to design specifications for workstation optimization. Results indicated that the task breakdown appropriately represented the use-case scenario, and the classification model adequately captured differences in cognitive workload experienced by participants. This research has broad implications on complex system design validation, providing a structure to achieve cognitive depth for the evaluation of human performance and subsequent design risk mitigation.","[Knisely, Benjamin M.; Joyner, Janell S.; Rutkowski, Anthony M.; Wong, Matthew; Barksdale, Samuel; Hotham, Hayden; Kharod, Kush; Vaughn-Cooke, Monifa] Univ Maryland, Dept Mech Engn, 1210 Kim Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Knisely, BM (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Mech Engn, 1210 Kim Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",bknisely@terpmail.umd.edu; jjoyner2@terpmail.umd.edu; kkharod@terpmail.umd.edu; mvc@umd.edu,"Vaughn-Cooke, Monifa/JRX-4059-2023","Vaughn-Cooke, Monifa/0000-0003-3577-3321; Knisely, Benjamin/0000-0001-8450-3198",Naval Air Systems Command [N004211820001]; Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRCHQ6017G0022],Naval Air Systems Command; Nuclear Regulatory Commission,This work was supported by the Naval Air Systems Command [Grant #N004211820001] and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [Grant #NRCHQ6017G0022].,,76,11,11,4,41,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",1071-5819,1095-9300,,INT J HUM-COMPUT ST,Int.

In normal brain ageing, speech processing undergoes functional reorganisation involving reductions of hemispheric asymmetry and overactivation in the prefrontal regions. However, little is known about how these changes generalise to other vocal production, such as singing, and how they are affected by associated cognitive demands.MethodsThe present cross-sectional fMRI study systematically maps the neural correlates of vocal production across adulthood (N=100, age 21-88 years) using a balanced 2x3 design where tasks varied in modality (speech: proverbs / singing: song phrases) and cognitive demand (repetition / completion from memory / improvisation).ResultsIn speech production, ageing was associated with decreased left pre- and postcentral activation across tasks and increased bilateral angular and right inferior temporal and fusiform activation in the improvisation task. In singing production, ageing was associated with increased activation in medial and bilateral prefrontal and parietal regions in the completion task, whereas other tasks showed no ageing effects. Direct comparisons between the modalities showed larger age-related activation changes in speech than singing across tasks, including a larger left-to-right shift in lateral prefrontal regions in the improvisation task.ConclusionThe present results suggest that the brains' singing network undergoes differential functional reorganisation in normal ageing compared to the speech network, particularly during a task with high executive demand. These findings are relevant for understanding the effects of ageing on vocal production as well as how singing can support communication in healthy ageing and neurological rehabilitation.","[Moisseinen, Nella; Sarkamo, Teppo; Kauramaki, Jaakko; Sihvonen, Aleksi J.; Martinez-Molina, Noelia] Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Mus Mind Body & Brain, Dept Psychol & Logoped, Cognit Brain Res Unit,Fac Med, Helsinki, Finland; [Kleber, Boris] Aarhus Univ, Fac Hlth, Ctr Mus Brain, Dept Clin Med, Aarhus, Denmark; [Sihvonen, Aleksi J.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Clin Res, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Sihvonen, Aleksi J.] Helsinki Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Helsinki, Finland; [Martinez-Molina, Noelia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona, Spain",University of Helsinki; Aarhus University; University of Queensland; University of Helsinki; Helsinki University Central Hospital; University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University,"Moisseinen, N (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Ctr Excellence Mus Mind Body & Brain, Dept Psychol & Logoped, Cognit Brain Res Unit,Fac Med, Helsinki, Finland.",nella.moisseinen@helsinki.fi,"Kauramäki, Jaakko/G-6962-2012; Kleber, Boris/JOK-6000-2023","Martinez-Molina, Noelia/0000-0001-7699-5540; Sihvonen, Aleksi/0000-0002-4501-7338; Kauramaki, Jaakko/0000-0002-6019-7920; Moisseinen, Nella/0000-0003-0697-4925",Finnish Cultural Foundation [00210736]; Academy of Finland [346211]; European Research Council [803466]; European Research Council (ERC) [803466] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"Financial support for the work was provided by the Finnish Cultural Foundation (grant no. 00210736), Academy of Finland (grant no. 346211), and the European Research Council (grant no. 803466).",,70,0,0,2,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-4365,,,FRONT AGING NEUROSCI,Front.

Yet, its role in bilinguals, fluent in both native and second languages, remains poorly understood. Here, we employed continuous theta burst stimulation to disrupt neural activity in the left posterior middle-temporal gyrus (pMTG) and angular gyrus (AG) while Italian-Friulian bilinguals performed a cued picture-naming task. The task involved between-language (naming objects in Italian or Friulian) and within-language blocks (naming objects [knife] or associated actions [cut] in a single language) in which participants could either maintain (non-switch) or change (switch) instructions based on cues. During within-language blocks, cTBS over the pMTG entailed faster naming for high-demanding switch trials, while cTBS to the AG elicited slower latencies in low-demanding non-switch trials. No cTBS effects were observed in the between-language block. Our findings suggest a causal involvement of the left pMTG and AG in lexico-semantic processing across languages, with distinct contributions to controlled vs. automatic retrieval, respectively. However, they do not support the existence of shared control mechanisms within and between language(s) production.

It specifically examines L2 learners' perceptions and production of the narrative and argumentative tasks within which the condition of idea support is manipulated. Seventy-six ESL learners participated in this study (each wrote four essays), and they completed a self-rating task questionnaire immediately after each writing performance. Their essays were analyzed using 12 syntactic and lexical complexity measures. Results showed that the learners perceived the two genres as inducing similar cognitive demands, while judging the writing tasks with idea support as less cognitively demanding. In contrast, the learners' use of syntactic structures differed widely across the two genres, but not across the idea support conditions. These findings suggest that there may be a weak connection between cognitive task complexity and linguistic complexity in written discourse and that syntactic features in learner essays are linguistic means to express genre-specific communicative functions. This study offers implications for L2 writing research and pedagogy.","[Yoon, Hyung-Jo] Calif State Univ Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",California State University System; California State University Northridge,"Yoon, HJ (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",hyungjo.yoon@csun.edu,,"Yoon, Hyung-Jo/0000-0002-8553-3708",International Research Foundation (TIRF Doctoral Dissertation Grant); National Federation of Modern Language Teachers Association (NFMLTA/MLJ Dissertation Support Grant),International Research Foundation (TIRF Doctoral Dissertation Grant); National Federation of Modern Language Teachers Association (NFMLTA/MLJ Dissertation Support Grant),"I would like to acknowledge that the funding for this research has been provided by the International Research Foundation (TIRF Doctoral Dissertation Grant, 2016) and the National Federation of Modern Language Teachers Association (NFMLTA/MLJ Dissertation Support Grant, 2016)",,52,19,20,13,82,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1060-3743,1873-1422,,J SECOND LANG WRIT,J.

Method: Forty young adults monologued by responding to open-ended questions in a silent baseline and five background noise conditions (debate, movie dialogue, contemporary music, classical music, and pink noise). Measures related to speech acoustics (intensity and frequency), speech fluency (speech rate, pausing, and disfluencies), and language production (lexical, morphosyntactic, and macrolinguistic structure) were analyzed and compared across conditions. Participants also reported on which conditions they perceived as more distracting. Results: All noise conditions resulted in some change to spoken language compared with the silent baseline. Effects on speech acoustics were consistent with expected changes due to the Lombard effect (e.g., increased intensity and fundamental frequency). Effects on speech fluency showed decreased pausing and increased disfluencies. Several background noise conditions also seemed to interfere with language production. Conclusions: Findings suggest that young adults present with both compensatory and interference effects when speaking in noise. Several adjustments may facilitate intelligibility when noise is present and help both speaker and listener maintain attention on the production. Other adjustments provide evidence that background noise eliciting linguistic interference has the potential to degrade spoken language even for healthy young adults, because of increased cognitive demands.","[Harmon, Tyson G.; Dromey, Christopher; Nelson, Brenna; Chapman, Kacy] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Commun Disorders, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Harmon, TG (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Dept Commun Disorders, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",Tyson.Harmon@byu.edu,"Harmon, Tyson/AAB-6528-2020","Harmon, Tyson/0000-0003-1936-8668; Dromey, Christopher/0000-0002-9030-2461",David O.

This paper explores assembly operators' perceptions of cognitive/mental workload to provide a holistic understanding of the work conditions that affect cognitive demands and performance. While the physical loading aspects of assembly work are well known, most empirical literature dealing with cognitive/mental loading in manufacturing tends to examine a few particular aspects, rather than address the issue with a holistic system view. This semi-structured interview study, involving 50 industrial assembly operators from three Swedish companies, explores how assemblers perceive that their cognitive performance and well-being is influenced by a wide variety of factors within the context of mechanical product assembly. The interview transcripts were analysed using a priori coding, followed by bottom-up Thematic Analysis. The results indicate that a variety of systemic effects on assemblers' cognitive performance can be classified as job demands or resources. Quite often, the absence of a resource mirrors a related demand, and good assembly conditions, as described by the interviewees, often re-frame demands as desirable challenges that foster motivation and positive feelings towards the work. The identified demands and resources stem from task design, timing, physical loading, intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, social teamwork and the product's interface design. Despite organisational differences and conditions between the three companies that took part in the study, the results are largely consistent.","[Wollter Bergman, Matilda; Berlin, Cecilia; Babapour Chafi, Maral] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Design & Human Factors, Dept Ind & Mat Sci, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Babapour Chafi, Maral] Reg Vastra Gotaland, Inst Stress Med, S-41319 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Falck, Ann-Christine; oertengren, Roland] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Prod Syst, Dept Ind & Mat Sci, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; Chalmers University of Technology,"Berlin, C (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Design & Human Factors, Dept Ind & Mat Sci, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",matilda.wollterbergman@chalmers.se,"Berlin, Cecilia/D-4832-2015",,,,,,72,6,6,8,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The head has been selected as the location for the interaction because it has been relatively under-researched compared to the torso or hands, and offers potential for hands-free attention direction and integration with new head and eyewear technology. Two studies have been conducted. The first examined the user's ability to discern three-parameter tactile signals presented at sites on the head. Findings highlighted that while multi-parameter cues could be interpreted with low error, challenges were faced when interpreting specific combinations of waveform and interval type, and when performing identification of interval pattern and stimulation location while visually-distracted. A second study investigated how use of the three-parameter tactile coding scheme impacted participants' situational awareness under several exertion conditions. Significant interaction was found between the exertion conditions and subjective cognitive workload. The relationship between situational awareness phases of participant SAGAT assessment scores were consistent between conditions, with perception and prediction phases outpacing comprehension. This suggests, pending further study of the suitability of situational awareness evaluation methods for tactile perception, that quickly trained participants may struggle to understand multi-parameter coding intended to convey changing events. Interpretations of coding schemes were found to vary, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting and mapping signals for presentation. Insights from our study can support interface designers aiming to heighten levels of spatial and situational awareness among their users through use of the tactile channel. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2014 to February 2015 at the cement, city traffic control and power plant control centers. Electrocardiography and electroencephalography data were recorded from forty males during performing their daily working in resting, low mental workload (LMW), high mental workload (HMW) and recovery conditions (each block 5 minutes). The NASA-Task Load Index (TLX) was used to evaluate the subjective workload of the operators. Results: The results showed that increasing MW had a significant effect on the operators subjective responses in two conditions ([1,53] = 216.303, P < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.803). Also, the Task-MW interaction effect on operators subjective responses was significant (F [3, 53] = 12.628, P < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.417). Analysis of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that increasing mental demands had a significant effect on heart rate, low frequency/high frequency ratio, theta and alpha band activity. Conclusion: The results suggested that when operators' mental demands especially in traffic control and power plant tasks increased, their mental fatigue and stress level increased and their mental health deteriorated. Therefore, it may be necessary to implement an ergonomic program or administrative control to manage mental probably health in these control centers. Furthermore, by evaluating MW, the control center director can organize the human resources for each MW condition to sustain the appropriate performance as well as improve system functions.","[Fallahi, Majid] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Dept Occupat Hyg, Hamadan, Iran; [Motamedzade, Majid] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Ergon, Hamadan, Iran; [Heidarimoghadam, Rashid] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Med Sci Res Ctr, Dept Ergon, Hamadan, Iran; [Soltanian, Ali Reza] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Modeling Noncommunicable Dis Res Ctr, Hamadan, Iran; [Miyake, Shinji] Univ Occupat & Environm Hlth, Sch Hlth Sci, Yahatanishi Ku, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8078555, Japan",Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; Hamadan University of Medical Sciences; University of Occupational & Environmental Health - Japan,"Motamedzade, M (corresponding author), Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Hlth Sci, Dept Ergon, Hamadan, Iran.",motamedzade@yahoo.com,"Soltanian, Ali/AAV-9146-2020; Motamedzade, Majid/I-7991-2012; Fallahi, Majid/AAC-4578-2020; heidarimoghadam, Rashid/I-6257-2018","heidarimoghadam, Rashid/0000-0002-5711-0150",Deputy of Research and Technology of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences,Deputy of Research and Technology of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences(Shahrekord University Medical Sciences),"Thanks to Deputy of Research and Technology of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences for approving and funding this research work.

The effect on motivational work design in assembly,HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS IN MANUFACTURING & SERVICE INDUSTRIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,assembly; intelligent assistance systems; motivational work characteristics; task rotation,QUESTIONNAIRE,"We aimed to provide causal evidence on the contradictory effects of projection-based intelligent assistance systems (IASs) for nine motivational work characteristics (MWCs). IASs are increasingly implemented in assembly to counteract rising cognitive workload due to individualized manufacturing processes. However, how IASs enhance or restrict MWCs is largely unknown. We conducted two studies with experimental vignette methodology. In Study 1 (N1 = 169 German employees), we manipulated an assembly workplace (with IAS vs. without IAS) and tested whether findings indicating only positive effects of IASs in the support of a simple assembly process can be transferred to more complex assembly processes. In Study 2 (N2 = 176 German employees), we manipulated again the assembly workplace (with IAS vs. without IAS) and in addition the dynamic of product changes (task rotation after 1 h vs. no task rotation). Analyzing the data with SPSS 27, we found increased feedback from job and information processing and decreased work scheduling, decision-making, and work methods autonomy when working with IAS. In Study 2, we did not find the main or interaction effects of task rotation on MWCs. Our experimental evidence suggests that working with IASs represents a double-edged sword regarding MWCs and that the effect of task rotation is limited. Hence, our results provide vital theoretical implications for a much-needed work design theory that delineates how new technologies shape work design and practical implications for modern assembly.","[Walczok, Marvin; Bipp, Tanja] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Psychol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Walczok, Marvin] Inst Psychol, Hauptstr 47-51, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Walczok, M (corresponding author), Inst Psychol, Hauptstr 47-51, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",marvin.walczok@psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de,"Walczok, Marvin/KAO-1879-2024","Walczok, Marvin/0000-0001-7858-2395; Bipp, Tanja/0000-0002-6086-7832",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01IS19043A-E],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Grant/Award Number:01IS19043A-E",,40,0,0,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1090-8471,1520-6564,,HUM FACTOR ERGON MAN,Hum.

It was hypothesized that the evaluation of the tactical task goal awareness could provide additional information concerning the cognitive demands a pilot is exposed to during a complex air combat task. A test setting was developed to test this hypothesis in a virtual flight training device. To highlight the impact of task complexity, high performance aircraft pilots' heart rate (HR), interbeat-interval (IBI), and performance in two simple flying tasks were first compared. Then, a similar comparison, complemented with the tactical task goal awareness measure, was made with two complex flying tasks. It was found that when the pilot's awareness of the tactical goals was low, a combination of low performance and low mental workload occurred. It was concluded that when the pilots' performance is evaluated on a complex air combat task, the awareness of the tactical goals, performance, and mental workload should be studied together as the pilot's awareness can explain some of HR/IBI responses that could be otherwise misinterpreted. More generally, mental workload, performance, and task goal awareness should all be considered when the operator's performance in any complex human-machine system is assessed.","[Mansikka, Heikki; Virtanen, Kai] Aalto Univ, Dept Math & Syst Anal, Helsinki 00076, Finland; [Harris, Don] Coventry Univ, Fac Engn & Comp, Human Syst Integrat Grp, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England",Aalto University; Coventry University,"Mansikka, H (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Dept Math & Syst Anal, Helsinki 00076, Finland.",heikki.mansikka@aalto.fi; kai.virtanen@aalto.fi; don.harris@coventry.ac.uk,"Harris, Don/AEQ-2631-2022; Mansikka, Heikki/GWM-9936-2022","Harris, Don/0000-0002-2113-8848; Mansikka, Heikki/0000-0002-7261-6408",,,,,82,23,25,1,42,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2291,2168-2305,,IEEE T HUM-MACH SYST,IEEE T.

Also, we assessed the type and frequency of subordinate clauses used in the children's written productions. Besides, we explored possible associations between syntactic complexity and different variables (such as age, Spanish input at home and time attending Spanish courses). Finally, we compared the SC performance of the heritage speakers (HS) with that of full Spanish speakers. Results showed that the groups do not differ greatly in the SC of their text productions.

In order to improve collaborative virtual environments, a better understanding of how operators share spatial information is needed. This work aimed to study the cognitive workload linked to spatial statements production in situations in which the relative positions of speaker, addressee and target were varied. Twenty-two participants were asked to give-in one go-instructions to a virtual collaborator on how to find a target in a 3D environment. The scene showed an avatar in the center of eight tables. Sixty-four configurations of avatar orientation (eight possibilities) and target location (on the eight tables) were tested. We measured the delay in starting the instruction once the target appeared, the instruction duration and the subjective evaluation of mental demand. Each instruction was classified according to the spatial reference frame used. The delay was influenced by the processing of spatial information in egocentered and addressee-centered reference frames. All subsequent measures were determined by mental transformations in addressee-centered coordinates. One condition in particular, when the target was situated diagonally behind the addressee, gave rise to a higher mental demand for the speaker, which points to the investment made by the speaker in achieving the least collaborative effort. Further work should seek to develop efficient tools to facilitate spatial communication in situations that induce the most mental workload.","[Pouliquen-Lardy, Lauriane] IRT Jules Verne, Bouguenais, France; [Pouliquen-Lardy, Lauriane; Mars, Franck; Milleville-Pennel, Isabelle] IRCCyN, Nantes, France; [Guillaume, Francois] Airbus Grp, Suresnes, France",Nantes Universite; Nantes Universite; Ecole Centrale de Nantes; Airbus; Airbus France S.A.S.,"Pouliquen-Lardy, L (corresponding author), IRT Jules Verne, Bouguenais, France.",lauriane.pouliquen-lardy@irccyn.ec-nantes.fr,"Mars, Franck/A-8889-2011","Mars, Franck/0000-0002-4140-0049",,,,,8,3,4,1,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4782,1612-4790,,COGN PROCESS,Cogn.

Here we ask (1) what is the nature of this language world-knowledge integration? and (2) what is the developmental trajectory including its age distribution? We examine Spanish copula production and comprehension in 142 children (age range: 4-12 years) and 26 adults. Using two tasks, sentence-choice (comprehension) and cued-production (production), we test the hypothesis that estar use is constrained by an ability to construe an alternative to the copula predication; an ability that develops with life experience. We test estar/ser use in two contexts: alternative-supporting, favoring estar use; and alternative-neutral, neutral regarding estar use, and possibly favoring ser use. The results show that for comprehension, children do not reveal adult-level sensitivity to context, exhibiting instead over-selection of estar sentences. For production, all children over-produce the estar sentence, even after having just chosen the ser counterpart. However, in this task, the 10- to 12-year-olds do behave similarly to adults and differently from 4- to 6-year-olds, consistent with our hypothesis. Alternative construal requires exposure to entities and properties in a variety of situations; exposure that older children are more likely to exhibit. Collectively, these results (1) support the properties of estar use hypothesized to underlie the language-world-knowledge integration, and (2) delineate a potential developmental trajectory whereby mastery of the copula may not begin to manifest until 10-12 years of age, not because of any one linguistic factor but rather due to specific world-knowledge exposure constraints.","[Aveledo, Fraibet] Univ Reading, Whiteknights Campus,Edith Morley 216, Reading RG6 6UR, Berks, England; [Sanchez-Alonso, Sara] Haskins Labs Inc, New Haven, CT USA; [Sanchez-Alonso, Sara; Pinango, Maria Mercedes] Yale Univ, 370 Temple St Dow Hall 307, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",University of Reading; Yale University; Haskins Laboratories; Yale University,"Aveledo, F (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Whiteknights Campus,Edith Morley 216, Reading RG6 6UR, Berks, England.;Piñango, MM (corresponding author), Yale Univ, 370 Temple St Dow Hall 307, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",f.aveledo@reading.ac.uk,"Sanchez-Alonso, Sara/AAD-4144-2022",,National Science Foundation [NSF-INSPIRE grant] [1248100]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1248100] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation [NSF-INSPIRE grant](National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [NSF-INSPIRE grant number 1248100 to M.M.P.].",,36,1,1,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0142-7237,1740-2344,,FIRST LANG,First Lang.,OCT,2022,42,5,,,,,649,669,,10.1177/01427237221100913,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01427237221100913,,22-Jul,21,"Psychology, Developmental; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Psychology; Linguistics,4A4LP,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,11/13/2024,WOS:000824407200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Humans perform such spontaneous motor actions at different rates that reflect specific biomechanical constraints of the effector system in use. However, there is some evidence for intra-individual consistency of specific spontaneous rates arguably resulting from common underlying processes. Additionally, individual and contextual factors such as musicianship and circadian rhythms have been suggested to influence spontaneous rates. This study investigated the relative contributions of these factors and provides a comprehensive picture of rates among different spontaneous motor behaviors, i.e., melody production, walking, clapping, tapping with and without sound production, the latter measured online before and in the lab. Participants (n = 60) exhibited high intra-individual stability across tasks. Task-related influences included faster tempi for spontaneous production rates of music and wider ranges of spontaneous motor tempi (SMT) and clapping rates compared to walking and music making rates. Moreover, musicians exhibited slower spontaneous rates across tasks, yet we found no influence of time of day on SMT as measured online in pre-lab sessions. Tapping behavior was similar in pre-lab and in-lab sessions, validating the use of online SMT assessments. Together, the prominent role of individual factors and high stability across domains support the idea that different spontaneous motor behaviors are influenced by common underlying processes.","[Engler, Ben H.] Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Dept Psychol, Salzburg, Austria; [Engler, Ben H.; Moller, Cecilie] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Mus Brain, Dept Clin Med, Aarhus, Denmark; [Engler, Ben H.; Moller, Cecilie] Royal Acad Mus Aarhus Aalborg, Aarhus, Denmark; [Zamm, Anna] Aarhus Univ, Dept Linguist Cognit Sci & Semiot, Aarhus, Denmark",Salzburg University; Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Engler, B (corresponding author), Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Dept Psychol, Salzburg, Austria.;Engler, B (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Mus Brain, Dept Clin Med, Aarhus, Denmark.;Engler, B (corresponding author), Royal Acad Mus Aarhus Aalborg, Aarhus, Denmark.",ben.engler@plus.ac.at,,"Zamm, Anna/0000-0002-3774-3516; Engler, Ben H./0009-0005-6162-9675; Moller, Cecilie/0000-0002-6524-7608",Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF117]; Federal State of Salzburg [20102-F2101143-FPR],Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Federal State of Salzburg,We would like to thank the Cognition and Behavior Lab (COBE Lab) management at the School of Business and Social Sciences (BSS) at Aarhus University for kind support and help in setting up the study.

Although fatigue is often associated with cancer treatment, it is also a result of the disease itself, even before intervention. CRF at the time of diagnosis may affect treatment timing or completion and is a consistent predictor of post-treatment fatigue at any time. The mechanisms underlying CRF are multidimensional and not well understood, particularly at the time of diagnosis.MethodsSixty-five breast cancer patients at the time of diagnosis were included. The participants completed self-assessment questionnaires about CRF, sleep disturbances, and emotional symptoms and wore an accelerometer to assess levels of spontaneous physical activity and sleep quality. During the experimental session, the participants underwent cognitive, neuromuscular, and exercise metabolism evaluations.ResultsUsing augmented backward elimination regression, this study found that emotional symptoms and perceived sleep disturbances were the strongest predictors of CRF (adjusted r2 = 0.51). Neuromuscular fatigability and sleep disturbance were also associated with physical dimensions, whereas cognitive performance was associated with cognitive dimensions.ConclusionAt the time of diagnosis, emotional and cognitive dimensions are over-represented compared to the general population, and specific subdimensions have specific predictors that support the idea of distinct mechanisms. Evaluating CRF subdimensions and their potential mechanisms at the time of diagnosis would be particularly relevant for identifying high-risk patients and offering them appropriate interventions.Trial registrationThis study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04391543) in May, 2020.","[Leclercq, A.; Chatrenet, A.; Martin, T.; Rahmani, A.] Le Mans Univ, Lab Movement Interact Performance MIP, UR 4334, Ave Olivier Messiaen, F-72085 Le Mans 9, France; [Morel, B.] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Lab Interuniv Biol Motricite, EA 7424, F-73000 Chambery, France; [Bourgeois, H.] Ctr Jean Bernard, Elsan Clin Victor Hugo, Le Mans, France; [Cojocarasu, O.; Mathie, C.] Ctr Hosp Le Mans CHM, Le Mans, France; [Chatrenet, A.] UCO, APCoSS Inst Phys Educ & Sports Sci IFEPSA, Angers, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Leclercq, A (corresponding author), Le Mans Univ, Lab Movement Interact Performance MIP, UR 4334, Ave Olivier Messiaen, F-72085 Le Mans 9, France.",alicialeclercqmip@gmail.com,,"Martin, Tristan/0000-0001-7576-883X; LECLERCQ, Alicia/0000-0003-3552-0228",Region Pays de la Loire; La Ligue Contre Le Cancer,Region Pays de la Loire(Region Pays de la Loire); La Ligue Contre Le Cancer(Ligue nationale contre le cancer),This study was funded by the Region Pays de la Loire and La Ligue Contre Le Cancer.,,50,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0941-4355,1433-7339,,SUPPORT CARE CANCER,Support.

A mixed reality (MR) integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping framework for immersive and intuitive telemanipulation of a complex mobile manipulator is presented. The proposed 3D immersive telerobotic schemes provide the users with depth perception through the merging of multiple 3D/2D views of the remote environment via MR subspace. The mobile manipulator platform consists of a 6-of-freedom (DOF) industrial manipulator, 3D-printed parallel gripper, and mobile base, which can be controlled by non-skilled operators who are physically separated from the robot working space through a velocity-based imitative motion mapping approach. This work evaluates the impact of depth perception and immersion provided by integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes on teleoperation efficiency and user experience in an MR environment. In particular, the MR enhanced systems maintain spatial awareness and perceptual salience of the remote scene in 3D, facilitating intuitive mixed reality human-robot interaction (MRHRI). This study compared two MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes against a typical 2D Baseline visual display method through pick-and-place, assembly, and dexterous manufacturing tasks.

In particular, excessively high or low mental workload can lead operators to neglect critical information. The objective of the present study is to investigate the potential of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) - a non-invasive method of measuring prefrontal cortex activity - in combination with measurements of heart rate variability (HRV), to predict mental workload during a simulated piloting task, with particular regard to task engagement and disengagement. Twelve volunteers performed a computer-based piloting task in which they were asked to follow a dynamic target with their aircraft, a task designed to replicate key cognitive demands associated with real life ROV operating tasks. In order to cover a wide range of mental workload levels, task difficulty was manipulated in terms of processing load and difficulty of control - two critical sources of workload associated with piloting and remotely operating a vehicle. Results show that both fNIRS and HRV are sensitive to different levels of mental workload; notably, lower prefrontal activation as well as a lower LF/HF ratio at the highest level of difficulty, suggest that these measures are suitable for mental overload detection. Moreover, these latter measurements point toward the existence of a quadratic model of mental workload. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Finally, the reward network showed a preference for the native accent, presumably revealing people's sense of social belonging.","[Hernandez, Mireia] Univ Barcelona, Inst Neurociencies, Dept Cognit Dev & Educ Psychol, Sect Cognit Proc, Barcelona, Spain; [Hernandez, Mireia] Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst IDIBELL, Cognit & Brain Plast Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Ventura-Campos, Noelia; Miro-Padilla, Anna; Avila, Cesar] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Basic Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychobiol, Neuropsychol & Funct Imaging Grp, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Ventura-Campos, Noelia] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Educ & Specif Didact, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Costa, Albert] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Barcelona, Spain; [Costa, Albert] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL); Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I; University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA,"Hernáandez, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Cognit Dev & Educ Psychol, Sect Cognit Proc, Passeig Vall dHebron 171, Barcelona 08035, Spain.",mireiahemandez@ub.edu,"Avila, Cesar/B-4370-2011; Ventura Campos, Noelia/L-4877-2014; Miro-Padilla, Anna/L-6193-2014; Hernandez, Mireia/D-6812-2014","Ventura Campos, Noelia/0000-0002-0443-8048; Miro-Padilla, Anna/0000-0002-6004-7439; Hernandez, Mireia/0000-0001-6819-3636","Ramon y Cajal research program of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RYC-2016-19477]; MINECO [PSI2016-78805-R]; Jaume I University [UJI-A2017-8]","Ramon y Cajal research program of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; MINECO(Spanish Government); Jaume I University","This work was supported by the Ramon y Cajal research program of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities (RYC-2016-19477 to MH), the MINECO (grant PSI2016-78805-R to CA), and Jaume I University (grant UJI-A2017-8 to NVC; pre-doctoral grant FPI to AMP).",,72,14,14,3,24,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0093-934X,1090-2155,,BRAIN LANG,Brain Lang.,JUL,2019,194,,,,,,12,22,,10.1016/j.bandl.2019.03.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2019.03.003,,,11,"Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology,ID5SI,30959385,Green Published,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000471735900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, empirical evidence remains inconclusive as to the impact of task complexity, and it is unknown how it may affect heritage language (HL) development. To address this issue, this study tested 81 adult HL and L2 learners of Spanish. Participants in the experimental conditions completed either a simple or a complex version of a monologic computerized task that delivered written recasts as corrective feedback but differed according to intentional reasoning demands. Participants completed three oral and written assessment tasks to measure development of the Spanish subjunctive in adjectival clauses. Results revealed that the simple group demonstrated greater gains, especially in written production. L2 learners and the HL simple group benefitted more from task-based instruction in comparison to the HL complex group. Findings have implications for the role of prior language experience and task outcomes.","[Torres, Julio] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Spanish & Portuguese, 322 Humanities Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Torres, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Spanish & Portuguese, 322 Humanities Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",torresju@uci.edu,,,,,,,43,16,18,2,12,CANADIAN MODERN LANGUAGE REV,N YORK,"UNIV TORONTO PRESS, JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST,, N YORK, ONTARIO M3H 5T8, CANADA",0008-4506,1710-1131,,CAN MOD LANG REV,Can.

According to cognitive load theory, this effect reflects the greater cognitive demands of retrieving contextual information from study phase. Pupil dilation can also occur when new items conceptually related to old ones are erroneously recognized as old, but the aspects of similarity that modulate false memory and related pupil responses remain unclear. We investigated this issue by manipulating the degree of featural similarity between new (unstudied) and old (studied) concepts in an old/new recognition task. We found that new concepts with high similarity were mistakenly identified as old and had greater pupil dilation than those with low similarity, suggesting that pupil dilation reflects the strength of evidence on which recognition judgments are based and, importantly, greater locus coeruleus and prefrontal activity determined by the higher degree of retrieval monitoring involved in recognizing these items.","[Montefinese, Maria; Vinson, David] UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP, England; [Ambrosini, Ettore] Univ Padua, Dept Neurosci, Via Giustiniani 5, I-35128 Padua, Italy; [Ambrosini, Ettore] Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Ambrosini, Ettore] Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Neurosci Imaging & Clin Sci, Via Vestini 33, I-66100 Chieti, Italy",University of London; University College London; University of Padua; University of Padua; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Montefinese, M (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP, England.",m.montefinese@ucl.ac.uk,"Vinson, David/V-1074-2019; Ambrosini, Ettore/AAH-5525-2019; Montefinese, Maria/HZH-7942-2023; Ambrosini, Ettore/K-5882-2016","Montefinese, Maria/0000-0002-7685-1034; Vinson, David/0000-0002-6226-3258; Ambrosini, Ettore/0000-0002-1439-5491",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [702655]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [702655] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(Marie Curie Actions); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 702655.,,98,14,18,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0301-0511,1873-6246,,BIOL PSYCHOL,Biol.

In both experiments, talking led to worse performance on the tracking task than listening. We attribute this finding to the increased cognitive demands of speech planning and monitoring. Growth curve analyses of task performance during the beginning and end of conversation segments revealed dynamical changes in the impact of conversation on visuomotor task performance, with increasing impact during the beginning of speaking segments and decreasing impact during the beginning of listening segments. At the end of speaking and listening segments, this pattern reversed. These changes became more pronounced with increased difficulty of the task. Together, these results show that the planning and monitoring aspects of conversation require the majority of the attentional resources that are also used for nonlinguistic visuomotor tasks. The fact that similar results were obtained when conversing with both a confederate and a friend indicates that our findings apply to a wide range of conversational situations.

It follows that both content and language are assessed, although research on how to do so remains scarce. This study explores the interplay between cognitive and linguistic demands of CLIL assessments. Having analysed over 4900 questions in Science/Biology textbooks, workbooks and examination papers in Hong Kong, we observed that junior secondary assessments were dominated by low-level cognitive (i.e. recall of knowledge) and linguistic (i.e. no production or word-level production) demands, whereas senior secondary assessments required higher-order thinking skills (i.e. application and analysis of knowledge) expressed in sentences or even texts. Also, based on the analysis of 70 junior secondary students' performance in school examination papers, we noticed a potential hindrance of linguistic demands to students' performance in CLIL assessments. These findings together underscore the integral role of language in CLIL assessments and raise questions about the adequacy of existing pedagogical practices in preparing students to tackle both cognitive and linguistic demands in CLIL assessments, particularly when they proceed to higher grade levels where the demands in both dimensions leap. These have significant implications for CLIL assessment design, pedagogy and teacher education.","[Lo, Yuen Yi] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fung, Daniel] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Linguist & Modern Languages, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Lo, YY (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuenyilo@hku.hk,"Lo, Yuen Yi/G-5216-2012","Lo, Yuen Yi/0000-0002-0850-5447; Fung, Daniel/0000-0001-7005-5697","Language Fund under Research and Development Projects 2015-16 of the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR), Hong Kong SAR","Language Fund under Research and Development Projects 2015-16 of the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR), Hong Kong SAR","This study was supported by the Language Fund under Research and Development Projects 2015-16 of the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR), Hong Kong SAR.",,44,28,28,4,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-0050,1747-7522,,INT J BILING EDUC BI,Int.

Mental fatigue (MF) was induced by completion of 90 minutes of the AX-CPT; muscle fatigue was induced by completion of an eccentric exercise performed with the elbow flexors (biceps fatigue, BF) or the knee extensors (quadriceps fatigue, QF). The control condition consisted of watching a movie. Stroke parameters (speed and accuracy of the ball), as well as feelings of fatigue and force production capacity of the elbow flexors (BF, MF and control conditions) and knee extensors (QF condition), were assessed pre and post fatigue protocols. Feelings of fatigue increased post fatigue protocols. Force production capacity decreased only in the BF and QF conditions. BF and MF induced a decrease in accuracy. This decrease in accuracy was associated with an increased ball speed in the BF condition, and a decreased ball speed in the MF condition. QF had a negligible effect on stroke performance. Our results suggest that both mental fatigue, and muscle fatigue, significantly impair table tennis performance and therefore coaches should take into account both the physical and mental state of table tennis players to optimize performance.","[Le Mansec, Yann; Nordez, Antoine; Dorel, Sylvain; Jubeau, Marc] Univ Nantes, Fac Sci Sport, Lab Motricite Interact Performance, EA4334, 25 Bis Blvd Guy Mollet,BP 72206, Nantes 3, France; [Pageaux, Benjamin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CAPS, UMR1093, UFR Sci Sport,INSERM, Dijon, France",Nantes Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Bourgogne,"Jubeau, M (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, Fac Sci Sport, Lab Motricite Interact Performance, EA4334, 25 Bis Blvd Guy Mollet,BP 72206, Nantes 3, France.",marc.jubeau@univ-nantes.fr,"; Pageaux, Benjamin/G-9253-2016","DOREL, Sylvain/0000-0001-8033-9028; Nordez, Antoine/0000-0002-7276-4793; Pageaux, Benjamin/0000-0001-9302-5183",,,,,37,63,67,5,84,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-0414,1466-447X,,J SPORT SCI,J.

This condition can result in decision fatigue and increased reliance on cognitive biases, which may compromise the decision-making process. To mitigate these risks, the implementation of decision support systems (DSSs) is essential. These systems are designed to aid operators in making swift, well-informed decisions, especially when their judgment may be faltering. Our research presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework utilizing dynamic influence diagrams and reinforcement learning to develop a powerful decision support system. The foundation of this AI framework is the creation of a robust, interpretable, and effective DSS that aids control room operators during critical process disturbances. By incorporating expert knowledge, the dynamic influence diagram provides a comprehensive model that captures the uncertainties inherent in complex industrial processes. It excels in anomaly detection and recommending optimal actions. Furthermore, this model is improved through a strategic collaboration with reinforcement learning, which refines the recommendations to be more context-specific and accurate. The primary goal of this AI framework is to equip operators with a live, reliable DSS that significantly enhances their response during process upsets. This paper describes the development of the AI framework and its implementation in a simulated control room environment. Our results show that the DSS can improve operator performance and reduce cognitive workload. However, it also uncovers a trade-off with situation awareness, which may decrease as operators become overly dependent on the system's guidance. Our study highlights the necessity of balancing the advantages of decision support with the need to maintain operator engagement and understanding during process operations.","[Mietkiewicz, Joseph; Leva, Maria Chiara] Technol Univ Dublin TU Dublin, Fac Food & Sci, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland; [Mietkiewicz, Joseph; Madsen, Anders L.] Hugin Expert A S, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Abbas, Ammar N.] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Data Sci, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria; [Abbas, Ammar N.] Technol Univ Dublin TU Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland; [Amazu, Chidera W.; Baldissone, Gabriele; Demichela, Micaela] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Sci Appl & Tecnol DISAT, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Madsen, Anders L.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Comp Sci, DK-9220 Aalborgost, Denmark",Softwarepark Hagenberg; Polytechnic University of Turin; Aalborg University,"Mietkiewicz, J (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin TU Dublin, Fac Food & Sci, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland.;Mietkiewicz, J (corresponding author), Hugin Expert A S, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark.",d21127042@mytudublin.ie; ammar.abbas@scch.at; chidera.amazu@polito.it; gabriele.baldissone@polito.it; anders@hugin.com; micaela.demichela@polito.it; mariachiara.leva@tudublin.ie,"Demichela, Micaela/O-8072-2019; Abbas, Ammar/HIZ-5718-2022","Madsen, Anders L/0000-0003-0633-9411; Mietkiewicz, Joseph/0009-0007-3109-5865; Demichela, Micaela/0000-0001-5247-7634; Amazu, Chidera Winifred/0000-0001-8788-3173; Leva, Maria Chiara/0000-0002-6770-8332; Baldissone, Gabriele/0000-0001-7015-8995; Abbas, Ammar/0000-0002-2578-5137",European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),No Statement Available,,59,3,4,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,FEB,2024,12,2,,,,,,,328,10.3390/pr12020328,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr12020328,,,33,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,JI5Z0,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,11/13/2024,WOS:001172562000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

ACT-R represents the human mind as a production rule system. Experiments are set up to build Six-dimensional tracking and control task cognition model and afterwards to validate feasibility of the proposed integrated cognition architecture. Ten subjects of similar training level are chosen to finish manual Six-dimensional tracking and control task with three task difficulty level: one only with displacement margin, one only with posture margin and one with displacement and posture margin. Cognition task analysis is firstly conducted on task performance of subjects. Cognition model of manual Six-dimensional tracking and control task is then built up based on the proposed integration architecture. The proposed integration model developed in the ACTR-QN describes component processes of tracking, decision making and controlling in a 3D environment by ACT-R production rules within QN network. Workload index for each cognition module is calculated based on sector utility throughout the whole task. Human results are compared with the modeled results in the dimension of task time and displacement/posture control trajectory deviation.

The aim of this exploratory sequential mixed methods study was to develop an occupation specific tool to measure the task load of PCRO using NASA Task Load Index (TLX) methodology. Participants were 30 human factors experts and 146 PCRO at two refinery complexes in Iran. Dimensions were developed via a cognitive task analysis, a research review, and three expert panels. Six dimensions were identified: perceptual demand, performance, mental demand, time pressure, effort, and stress. Data from 120 PCRO confirmed that the developed PCRO-TLX has acceptable psychometric properties, and a comparison with the NASA-TLX confirmed that perceptual, not physical, demand was relevant for measuring workload in PCRO. There was a positive convergence of scores of the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique and the PCRO-TLX. This reliable tool (alpha = 0.83) is recommended for risk assessing the task load of PCRO.Practitioner summary: There are benefits of having a specific tool to measure task load in safety critical roles. Thus, we developed and validated an easy-to-use targeted tool, the PCRO-TLX, for process control room operatives.

These types of situations may compound language deficits for people with aphasia (PWA). An understanding of the language interference that may occur from cognitive and social demands is an important precursor for assessment and intervention that addresses everyday communication situations.AimsTo determine how cognitively and socially demanding conditions affect micro- and macrolinguistic production for people with moderate, mild, or no aphasia during narrative discourse and to compare effects among groups.MethodThirty participants with mild (n = 9), moderate (n = 9), or no (n = 12) aphasia completed story-retell tasks in three separate conditions: baseline, unresponsive partner, and dual-task. The stories and conditions were pseudorandomly presented for each participant. A secondary analysis investigated lexical, morphosyntactic, and macrolinguistic production.ResultsAs expected, when compared with baseline, the dual-task condition interfered more with language production than the unresponsive partner condition for all participant groups. Interference on distinct aspects of language production for each participant group, however, was not anticipated. This interference was characterized by significant dual-task costs on (a) macrolinguistic production for participants with moderate aphasia, (b) word productivity and lexical diversity for participants with mild aphasia, and (c) lexical-phonological errors for participants with no aphasia. When compared with baseline, the unresponsive partner led to numerical interference on the same measure and group combinations as the dual-task, but these changes were not statistically significant.ConclusionsCognitive and social demands have different effects on language depending on the presence and severity of aphasia with cognitive demands impacting discourse-level structures for participants with moderate aphasia, lexical-level structures for participants with mild aphasia, and lexical-phonological errors for participants with no aphasia. Future research should identify how these demands could be integrated with assessment and treatment for PWA to help improve everyday communication participation.","[Harmon, Tyson G.

Prior findings indicate that when a speaker addresses a pair of listeners with discrepant knowledge, that speakers Aim Low, designing their utterances for the least knowledgeable of the two addressees. Here, we test the hypothesis that speakers will depart from an Aim Low approach in order to efficiently communicate with larger groups of interacting partners. Further, we ask whether the cognitive demands of tracking multiple conversational partners' perspectives places limitations on successful audience design. We find that speakers can successfully track information about what up to four of their partners do and do not know in conversation. When addressing groups of 3-4 addressees at once, speakers design language based on the combined knowledge of the group. These findings point to an audience design process that simultaneously represents the perspectives of multiple other individuals and combines these representations in order to design utterances that strike a balance between the different needs of the individuals within the group.","[Yoon, Si On] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Yoon, Si On] Univ Iowa, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Brown-Schmidt, Sarah] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol & Human Dev, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Iowa; Vanderbilt University,"Yoon, SO (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Wendell Johnson Speech & Hearing Ctr, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, 250 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",syoon@illinois.edu,"Yoon, Si/AAN-7757-2021","Yoon, Si On/0000-0001-6715-4598","National Science Foundation [BCS 12-57029, BCS 15-56700]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This material is based on work supported by National Science Foundation grants BCS 12-57029 and BCS 15-56700 to Sarah Brown-Schmidt.,,63,17,22,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0364-0213,1551-6709,,COGNITIVE SCI,Cogn.

Linguistic analyses of corpora of conversation are needed to understand the structure of conversations, and experimental work is indispensable for understanding the underlying cognitive processes. We argue that joint consideration of corpus and experimental data is most informative when the utterances elicited in a lab experiment match those extracted from a corpus in relevant ways. This requirement to compare like with like seems obvious but is not trivial to achieve. To illustrate this approach, we report two experiments where responses to polar (yes/no) questions were elicited in the lab and the response latencies were compared to gaps between polar questions and answers in a corpus of conversational speech. We found, as expected, that responses were given faster when they were easy to plan and planning could be initiated earlier than when they were harder to plan and planning was initiated later. Overall, in all but one condition, the latencies were longer than one would expect based on the analyses of corpus data. We discuss the implication of this partial match between the data sets and more generally how corpus and experimental data can best be combined in studies of conversation.","[Meyer, Antje S.; Alday, Phillip M.; Decuyper, Caitlin; Knudsen, Birgit] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Max Planck Society,"Meyer, AS (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",Antje.meyer@mpi.nl,"Alday, Phillip/I-4208-2016","Alday, Phillip/0000-0002-9984-5745",,,,,57,16,16,1,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Findings showed the cognitive demands of tasks were associated with learners' affective responses to tasks as well as objective and subjective measures of fluency. Furthermore, task-related anxiety and perceived success in task completion were the most important affective factors associated with fluent task performance, whereas interest and task motivation were correlated with native speakers' fluency ratings.

How IAS affect work characteristics which are crucial for promoting work motivation of employees is yet unclear. Based on the cyber-physical systems transformation framework, the model of routine-biased technological change, and a comprehensive model of work design, we expected in- and decreases in motivational work characteristics (MWC) when working with IAS. Furthermore, we posited a buffering effect of the option of voluntary use on decreasing knowledge characteristics. Applying an online case study with experimental vignette methodology (EVM) allowed us to identify effects of the IAS on MWC before it is widely implemented. 203 German and British blue-collar workers evaluated an assembly workplace according to three experimental conditions (work without IAS, work with IAS, work with voluntary use of IAS). We identified enhanced feedback from the job and information processing in work with IAS in contrast to a traditional assembly workplace but found no restrictions (or elevations) in terms of other task (i.e., autonomy) or knowledge characteristics (i.e., job complexity, problem solving, specialization, skill variety). Thus, our results indicate that the IAS improves some motivational work characteristics of the assembly workplace, although it misses the primary goal of cognitive relief. Our study highlights the need for work design theories that specify the effect of IAS on motivational work characteristics and the potential benefit of IAS in assembly of the future.","[Walczok, Marvin; Bipp, Tanja] Dept Psychol, Hauptstr 47-51, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",,"Walczok, M (corresponding author), Dept Psychol, Hauptstr 47-51, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",marvin.walczok@psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de,"Walczok, Marvin/KAO-1879-2024","Walczok, Marvin/0000-0001-7858-2395",Projekt DEAL; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) project [01IS19043A-E],Projekt DEAL; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Focused on four adult students each having 0?1 year of formal L1 education, the researcher documented instances of copying classroom text over a 5-month period. In alignment with children?s orthographic development, the findings indicate that adults new to writing may also progress along a similar trajectory of written shape production, relying on both motor skill development and the subsequent integration of a perceptual-motor component. Moreover, these learners demonstrated varying levels of attunement to orthographic features of text, including letter count and sequence, word segmentation, and adherence to semiotic norms of paper orientation, lines, and margins. The variance between the participants resulted in varying learner starting points depending on which skills students had previously acquired or been exposed to. Consequently, practitioners should not make any assumptions about the skills incoming students already possess; additionally, practitioners must be conscious of the varying cognitive demands entailed within a simple copying task given the myriad of novel skills entailed.","[Gonzalves, Lisa] West Costa Adult Educ, Richmond, CA 94804 USA",,"Gonzalves, L (corresponding author), West Costa Adult Educ, Richmond, CA 94804 USA.",lisa.m.gonzalves@gmail.com,,"Gonzalves, Lisa/0000-0002-2621-191X",,,,,43,3,3,2,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1060-3743,1873-1422,,J SECOND LANG WRIT,J.

The influence of notional number has hardly been investigated in bilinguals, however. Most previous research on bilingual agreement computation has focused on agreement errors, and less is known about agreement computation in cases where multiple licit options exist. One such phenomenon is pseudo-partitives (German: eine Tute Nusse 'one bag of nuts'), for which a verb may agree with either the first or the second noun phrase. We present data from 150 L1 speakers of German and Turkish-German early bilinguals who performed a sentence-completion task. While both groups showed awareness of the optionality in agreement, both preferred the first noun phrase as the agreement controller. Interestingly, notional plurality affected bilinguals' verb choices more than those of L1 speakers, whose responses were influenced by notional plurality only in the most challenging number conflict condition.

Therefore, it has been argued that reciprocity may be restricted to animals that can meet these demands. Here, we provide evidence for the potential presence of direct reciprocity in teleost fishes. We demonstrate that in pairs of coral reef rabbitfishes (f. Siganidae), one fish frequently assumes an upright vigilance position in the water column, while the partner forages in small crevices in the reef substratum. Both behaviours are strongly coordinated and partners regularly alternate their positions, resulting in a balanced distribution of foraging activity. Compared to solitary individuals, fishes in pairs exhibit longer vigilance bouts, suggesting that the help provided to the partner is costly. In turn, fishes in pairs take more consecutive bites and penetrate deeper into crevices than solitary individuals, suggesting that the safety provided by a vigilant partner may outweigh initial costs by increasing foraging efficiency. Thus, the described system appears to meet all of the requirements for direct reciprocity. We argue that the nature of rabbitfish pairs provides favourable conditions for the establishment of direct reciprocity, as continuous interaction with the same partner, simultaneous needs, interdependence, and communication relax the cognitive demands of reciprocal cooperation.","[Brandl, Simon J.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Brandl, Simon J.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; James Cook University,"Brandl, SJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",simon.brandl@my.jcu.edu.au,"Brandl, Simon/H-4150-2019","Brandl, Simon/0000-0002-6649-2496",,,,,93,54,57,1,50,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,25-Sep,2015,5,,,,,,,,14556,10.1038/srep14556,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep14556,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,CS0GC,26403250,"Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,11/13/2024,WOS:000361735300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is scant research on actual benefits in production vehicles or how different interface designs affect attentional demands. Driving performance, visual engagement, and indices of workload (heart rate, skin conductance, subjective ratings) were assessed in 80 drivers randomly assigned to drive a 2013 Chevrolet Equinox or Volvo XC60. The Chevrolet MyLink system allowed completing tasks with one voice command, while the Volvo Sensus required multiple commands to navigate the menu structure. When calling a phone contact, both voice systems reduced visual demand relative to the visual-manual interfaces, with reductions for drivers in the Equinox being greater. The Equinox 'one-shot' voice command showed advantages during contact calling but had significantly higher error rates than Sensus during destination address entry. For both secondary tasks, neither voice interface entirely eliminated visual demand. Practitioner Summary: The findings reinforce the observation that most, if not all, automotive auditory-vocal interfaces are multi-modal interfaces in which the full range of potential demands (auditory, vocal, visual, manipulative, cognitive, tactile, etc.) need to be considered in developing optimal implementations and evaluating drivers' interaction with the systems. Social Media: In-vehicle voice-interfaces can reduce visual demand but do not eliminate it and all types of demand need to be taken into account in a comprehensive evaluation.","[Mehler, Bruce; Reimer, Bryan; Dobres, Jonathan] Univ New England, MIT AgeLab, Transportat Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kidd, David; Reagan, Ian; McCartt, Anne] Insurance Inst Highway Safety, Arlington, VA USA",University of New England - Maine,"Mehler, B (corresponding author), Univ New England, MIT AgeLab, Transportat Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",bmehler@mit.edu,"Mehler, Bruce/E-4538-2017","Mehler, Bruce/0000-0001-5929-4179; Kidd, David/0000-0001-8436-3877",Insurance Institute for Highway Safety; United States Department of Transportation's Region One University Transportation Center at MIT,Insurance Institute for Highway Safety; United States Department of Transportation's Region One University Transportation Center at MIT,This work was supported by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and a grant from United States Department of Transportation's Region One University Transportation Center at MIT.,,75,47,52,2,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0014-0139,1366-5847,,ERGONOMICS,Ergonomics,,2016,59,3,,,,,344,367,,10.1080/00140139.2015.1081412,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2015.1081412,,,24,"Engineering, Industrial; Ergonomics; Psychology, Applied; Psychology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Psychology,DO3OY,26269281,"Green Published, hybrid",,,11/13/2024,WOS:000377692100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study includes school-age children and adult native speakers of German learning English as a foreign language - a language combination not previously investigated within the Processing Instruction and individual differences research paradigm. The present study investigates directly whether two different age groups will benefit equally from Processing Instruction in altering their reliance on lexical temporal indicators and redirecting their attention to verb forms on Processing Instruction activities with different cognitive demands. The grammatical feature chosen for this study is the English past simple tense marking tested on both interpretation and production measures. The results from this study provide further evidence that the Processing Instruction is an effective instructional treatment in helping school-age children and adult L2 learners to make accurate form-meaning connections. The results from the first sentence-level interpretation task and the production task showed that Processing Instruction has positive and equal effects on both age groups (school-age learners and adults). The positive effects of instruction were maintained over the delayed post-test for both age groups who made similar gains on the immediate post-test. The results from the second (cognitively more complex) sentence-level interpretation task indicated that the adults made greater gains than school-age learners. However, both groups retained the positive effects of instruction over time. The difference in gains between the two age groups on the second sentence-level interpretation task can be explained in terms of cognitive processing load.","[Benati, Alessandro] Univ Greenwich, Dept Literature, Greenwich SE10 9LS, England; [Angelovska, Tanja] Paris Lodron Univ Salzburg, Dept English & Amer Studies, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",University of Greenwich; Salzburg University,"Benati, A (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Dept Literature, Language & Theatre Greenwich Campus, Greenwich SE10 9LS, England.",A.Benati@gre.ac.uk; tanja.angelovska@lmu.de,"Benati, Alessandro/AAE-8361-2020; Angelovska, Tanja/M-8606-2016","Angelovska, Tanja/0000-0002-7311-766X",Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),This study was supported by a Leverhulme Trust post-doctoral fellowship grant.

Here we uncover some of the key cognitive mechanisms that characterise this process in the domain of language learning. In five experiments adult participants learned new morphological units embedded in fictitious words created by attaching new affixes (e.g., -afe) to familiar word stems (e.g., sleepafe is a participant in a study about the effects of sleep). Participants' ability to generalise semantic knowledge about the affixes was tested using tasks requiring the comprehension and production of novel words containing a trained affix (e.g., sailafe). We manipulated the delay between training and test (Experiment 1), the number of unique exemplars provided for each affix during training (Experiment 2), and the consistency of the form-to-meaning mapping of the affixes (Experiments 3-5). In a task where speeded online language processing is required (semantic priming), generalisation was achieved only after a memory consolidation opportunity following training, and only if the training included a sufficient number of unique exemplars. Semantic inconsistency disrupted speeded generalisation unless consolidation was allowed to operate on one of the two affix-meanings before introducing inconsistencies. In contrast, in tasks that required slow, deliberate reasoning, generalisation could be achieved largely irrespective of the above constraints. These findings point to two different mechanisms of generalisation that have different cognitive demands and rely on different types of memory representations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Up until now, the validity of psychometric intelligence constructs has been scrutinized with regard to its importance for CPS performance. At the same time, different CPS measurement approaches competing for the title of the best way to assess CPS have been developed. In the first part of the paper, we investigate the predictability of CPS performance on the basis of the Berlin Intelligence Structure Model and Cattell's investment theory as well as an elaborated knowledge taxonomy. In the first study, 137 students managed a simulated shirt factory (Tailorshop; i.e., a complex real life-oriented system) twice, while in the second study, 152 students completed a forestry scenario (FSYS; i.e., a complex artificial world system). The results indicate that reasoning - specifically numerical reasoning (Studies 1 and 2) and figural reasoning (Study 2) - are the only relevant predictors among the intelligence constructs. We discuss the results with reference to the Brunswik symmetry principle. Path models suggest that reasoning and prior knowledge influence problem solving performance in the Tailorshop scenario mainly indirectly. In addition, different types of system-specific knowledge independently contribute to predicting CPS performance. The results of Study 2 indicate that working memory capacity, assessed as an additional predictor, has no incremental validity beyond reasoning. We conclude that (1) cognitive abilities and prior knowledge are substantial predictors of CPS performance, and (2) in contrast to former and recent interpretations, there is insufficient evidence to consider CPS a unique ability construct. In the second part of the paper, we discuss our results in light of recent CPS research, which predominantly utilizes the minimally complex systems (MCS) measurement approach. We suggest ecologically valid microworlds as an indispensable tool for future CPS research and applications.","[Suess, Heinz-Martin] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Inst Psychol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Kretzschmar, Andre] Univ Tubingen, Hector Res Inst Educ Sci & Psychol, Tubingen, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Süss, HM (corresponding author), Otto Von Guericke Univ, Inst Psychol, Magdeburg, Germany.",heinz-martin.suess@ovgu.de,"Kretzschmar, André/S-5980-2019","Kretzschmar, Andre/0000-0002-7290-1145","Free University of Berlin's Commission for Research Promotion (FNK); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; University of Tubingen's Open Access Publishing Fund; Postdoc Academy of the Hector Research Institute of Education Sciences and Psychology, Tubingen - Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Science, Education and the Arts","Free University of Berlin's Commission for Research Promotion (FNK); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Tubingen's Open Access Publishing Fund; Postdoc Academy of the Hector Research Institute of Education Sciences and Psychology, Tubingen - Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Science, Education and the Arts","The first study was supported by a grant from the Free University of Berlin's Commission for Research Promotion (FNK) to the first author and A.

We compared them to multilingual control participants scanned at the same interval of time. Increases in cortical thickness were specific to trainee interpreters. Increases were observed in regions involved in lower-level, phonetic processing (left posterior superior temporal gyrus, anterior supramarginal gyrus and planum temporale), in the higher-level formulation of propositional speech (right angular gyrus) and in the conversion of items from working memory into a sequence (right dorsal premotor cortex), and finally, in domain-general executive control and attention (right parietal lobule). Findings are consistent with the linguistic requirements of simultaneous interpretation and also with the more general cognitive demands on attentional control for expert performance in simultaneous interpreting.

The different assumptions lead to diverse predictions regarding infants' gestural or multimodal behavior in recurring situations, in which some objects are familiar and others are unfamiliar. To examine these different predictions, we observed 14 children aged between 14 and 16 months biweekly in a semi-experimental situation with a caregiver and explored how children's verbal and gestural behaviors change as a function of their familiarization with objects. We split the children into two groups based on their reported vocabulary size at 21 months of age (larger vs. smaller vocabulary). We found that children with a larger vocabulary at 21 months had an increase in their pointing with words toward unfamiliar objects as well as in their total amount of words, whereas for children with smaller vocabularies we did not find differences in relation to their familiarization with objects. We discuss these findings in terms of a social-pragmatic use of pointing gestures.","[Grimminger, Angela; Rohlfing, Katharina J.] Univ Bielefeld, Exzellenzcluster Cognit Interact Technol CITEC, Inspirat 1, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany; [Lueke, Carina; Ritterfeld, Ute] TU Dortmund, Fak Rehabil Wissensch, Fachbereich Sprache & Kommunikat, Emil Figge Str 50, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Liszkowski, Ulf] Univ Hamburg, Entwicklungspsychol, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Rohlfing, Katharina J.] Univ Paderborn, Psycholinguist, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",University of Bielefeld; Dortmund University of Technology; University of Hamburg; University of Paderborn,"Grimminger, A (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Exzellenzcluster Cognit Interact Technol CITEC, Inspirat 1, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany.",agrimminger@uni-bielefeld.de; carina.lueke@tu-dortmund.de; ute.ritterfeld@tu-dortmund.de; ulf.liszkowski@uni-hamburg.de; katharina.rohlfing@uni-paderborn.de,"Lüke, Carina/AAF-3587-2021",,,,,,34,4,4,0,2,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"MERKELSTR 3, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",2191-9186,2191-9194,,FRUHE BILD,Fruhe Bild.,APR,2016,5,2,,,,,91,97,,10.1026/2191-9186/a000257,http://dx.doi.org/10.1026/2191-9186/a000257,,,7,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,EC5XG,,,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000388210000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study explores how reasoning demands in tasks and working memory (WM) capacity predict learners' ability to notice English question structures provided in the form of recasts and how this contributes to subsequent development of English question formation. Eighty-one nonnative speakers of English completed three interactive tasks with a native speaker interlocutor, one WM task, and three oral production tests. Prior to the first interactive task, participants were randomly assigned to a task group (simple or complex). During task performance, all learners were provided with recasts targeting errors in question formation. The results showed that learners' cognitive processes during tasks were in line with the cognitive demands of the tasks, at two complexity levels. The findings suggest that WM was the only significant predictor of the amount of noticing of recasts as well as of learners' question development. With regard to interaction effects between WM and task complexity, high WM learners who carried out a complex version of the tasks benefitted the most from task-based interaction.","[Kim, YouJin] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Payant, Caroline] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Pearson, Pamela] Linfield Coll, Mcminnville, OR USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Idaho; Linfield University,"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist & ESL, 25 Pk Pl,Suite 1500, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",ykim39@gsu.edu,"Kim, YouJin/O-3797-2018",,Cleon F.

This study analyzed the perception of the determinants of work activity among workers from the water, sanitation, and waste sector in Portugal, the variation in the work demands among different shift types, and the main predictors of sleep disturbances. Data collection was performed through a questionnaire administered to 300 workers in 2017 and 2019. An ageing population was identified in all shift types. Possible occupational trajectories with changes from the fixed night and early morning shifts to daytime and fast rotating shifts may be linked to health conditions. Workers in fixed night and early morning shifts perceived higher physical demands and environmental discomfort, lower social support, and job dissatisfaction. Workers in daytime or fast rotating shifts perceived higher cognitive demands. Sleep disturbances were perceived more negatively among those working permanently on night and early morning shifts. The main predictors of sleep disturbance in both years were the type of shift, and high physical demands. The study highlights the relevance of characterizing the work demands to establish future strategies to improve the health and well-being of shift workers.","[Dionisio, Ana; Cotrim, Teresa P.; Carvalhais, Jose] Univ Lisbon, Fac Motricidade Humana, Ergon Lab, Estr Costa, P-1499002 Cruz Quebrada, Portugal; [Cotrim, Teresa P.; Carvalhais, Jose] Univ Lisbon, Fac Arquitetura, CIAUD Ctr Invest Arquitetura Urbanismo & Design, Polo Univ Alto da Ajuda, Rua Sa Nogueira, P-1349055 Lisbon, Portugal; [Teles, Julia] Univ Lisbon, Fac Motricidade Humana, CIPER, Estr Costa, P-1499002 Cruz Quebrada, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Cotrim, TP (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Motricidade Humana, Ergon Lab, Estr Costa, P-1499002 Cruz Quebrada, Portugal.;Cotrim, TP (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Arquitetura, CIAUD Ctr Invest Arquitetura Urbanismo & Design, Polo Univ Alto da Ajuda, Rua Sa Nogueira, P-1349055 Lisbon, Portugal.",tcotrim@fmh.ulisboa.pt,"Dionísio, Ana/I-4263-2019; Teles, Julia/N-1862-2013; Cotrim, Teresa/N-1322-2013; Carvalhais, Jose/N-4502-2013","Teles, Julia/0000-0002-5923-6582; Pereira, Ana Patricia Dionisio/0000-0002-6401-3965; Cotrim, Teresa/0000-0003-2950-5208; Carvalhais, Jose/0000-0003-1180-7603",,,,,32,1,1,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2571-5577,,APPL SYST INNOV,Appl.

A dangerous driving style would possibly result in dangerous behaviors. If the driving styles can be recognized by some appropriate classification methods, much attention could be paid to the drivers with dangerous driving styles. The driving style recognition module can be integrated into the advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), which integrates different modules to improve driving automation, safety and comfort, and then the driving safety could be enhanced by pre-warning the drivers or adjusting the vehicle's controlling parameters when the dangerous driving style is detected. In most previous studies, driver's questionnaire data and vehicle's objective driving data were utilized to recognize driving styles. And promising results were obtained. However, these methods were indirect or subjective in driving style evaluation. In this paper a method based on objective driving data and electroencephalography (EEG) data was presented to classify driving styles. A simulated driving system was constructed and the EEG data and the objective driving data were collected synchronously during the simulated driving. The driving style of each participant was classified by clustering the driving data via K-means. Then the EEG data was denoised and the amplitude and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of four frequency bands were extracted as the EEG features by Fast Fourier transform and Welch. Finally, the EEG features, combined with the classification results of the driving data were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and a leave-one-subject-out cross validation was utilized to evaluate the performance. The SVM classification accuracy was about 80.0%. Conservative drivers showed higher PSDs in the parietal and occipital areas in the alpha and beta bands, aggressive drivers showed higher PSD in the temporal area in the delta and theta bands. These results imply that different driving styles were related with different driving strategies and mental states and suggest the feasibility of driving style recognition from EEG patterns.","[Yan, Fuwu; Liu, Mutian; Ding, Changhao; Wang, Yi; Yan, Lirong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Automot Engn, Hubei Key Lab Adv Technol Automot Components, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yan, Fuwu; Liu, Mutian; Ding, Changhao; Wang, Yi; Yan, Lirong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Automot Engn, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Automot Components T, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology,"Yan, LR (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Automot Engn, Hubei Key Lab Adv Technol Automot Components, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Yan, LR (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Automot Engn, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Automot Components T, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lirong.yan@whut.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [61876137],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 61876137).,,57,26,28,9,127,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The present study seeks to investigate dose-related effects of specific drugs and whether these vary with the cognitive demands of the task. One hundred and five participants (mean age 21.33, SD 3.14; 77 females, 28 males) attempted to generate solutions for eight one-model syllogisms and one syllogism for which there was no valid conclusion. All of the one-model syllogisms generated at least one valid conclusion and six generated two valid conclusions. In these six cases, one of the conclusions was classified as common and the other as non-common. The number of valid common inferences was negatively associated with the aspects of short-term cannabis use and with measures of IQ. The outcomes observed were more than simple post-intoxication effects since cannabis use in the 10 days immediately before testing was unrelated to reasoning performance. Following adjustment for multiple comparisons, the number of non-common valid inferences was not significantly associated with any of the drug-use measures. Recent cannabis use appears to impair the processes associated with generating valid common inferences while not affecting the production of non-common inferences. It is possible, therefore, that the two types of inference may recruit different executive resources, which may differ in their susceptibility to cannabis-related effects.","[Fisk, John E.; Morley, Andy M.] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Psychol, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; [Hadjiefthyvoulou, Florentia] Nottingham Trent Univ, Div Psychol, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England; [Montgomery, Catharine] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England",University of Central Lancashire; Nottingham Trent University; Liverpool John Moores University,"Fisk, JE (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Psychol, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",jfisk@uclan.ac.uk,"Montgomery, Catharine/B-6096-2014","Montgomery, Catharine/0000-0003-2805-5807; Hadjiefthyvoulou, Florentia/0000-0003-2876-6086; Fisk, John/0000-0002-2981-0870",,,,,38,0,0,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4782,1612-4790,,COGN PROCESS,Cogn.

However, insufficient instruments are available to conduct parallel assessment on fatigue in parents and children in China. In this regard, an appropriate measurement method must be developed. Objectives: This study aims to determine the reliability and validity of the Chinese-language PedsQL (TM) MFS. Methods: Children with cancer (n = 125) and their parents were surveyed in Guangzhou, China. The parents of children aged 2-4 years completed the PedsQL (TM) MFS proxy reports, whereas the other children and their parents completed the questionnaires by themselves. Results: The PedsQL (TM) MFS-Chinese version demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency reliability (child self-report Cronbach's alpha = 0.87; parent self-report Cronbach's alpha = 0.93). The factor loadings of the items ranged from 0.78 to 0.87 for general fatigue, 0.56-0.78 for sleep/rest fatigue, and 0.62-0.89 for cognitive fatigue. Conclusion: This study proves that the PedsQL (TM) MFS-Chinese version is an effective tool for screening fatigue in Chinese children with cancer. Copyright (C) 2016, Chinese Nursing Association.

The selected tasks include descriptions of dynamic entities which require careful planning and a chronological sequence of speech acts in real time, as well as the description of static spatial arrangements and their relations. The speech tasks were first performed in the native language, followed by the performance of the same tasks in the foreign language. A significantly faster speech rate was hypothesized in the foreign language condition for each investigated speech task due to the unautomated nature of L2 speech production mechanisms. The obtained results point to the conclusion that the speech rate is significantly slower in L2 in narrative tasks due to the conceptual complexity of the task. However, no significant differences in the speech rate were found between the two languages in the case of highly structured tasks with shorter duration, or in the case of repeated tasks. Due to the fact that the tasks have already been performed in the native language, the processing demands on the level of conceptualization decrease, freeing up the attentional resources, which, in turn, assist the formulation and articulation stage by reducing the processing pressure. Also, the fact that no significant differences were found might be explained by the existence of strong associative links between L1 and L2, as well as by the occurrence of highly frequent words which can be easily retrieved from the mental lexicon, especially if they have previously been activated in the native language. Introduction of new topics, on the other hand, implies higher cognitive demands in the conceptualization stage, resulting in a slower speech rate in both languages.","[Kovac, Mirjana Matea] Filozofski Fak, Split, Croatia",,"Kovac, MM (corresponding author), Filozofski Fak, Split, Croatia.",mirjana@ffst.hr,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,3,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC PHILOSOPHY",RIJEKA,"TRG IVANA KLOBUCARICA 1, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",0353-4642,1848-9680,,FLUMINENSIA,Fluminensia,,2018,30,1,,,,,77,97,,10.31820/f.30.1.8,http://dx.doi.org/10.31820/f.30.1.8,,,21,Language & Linguistics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Linguistics,GG9FJ,,gold,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000433006000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We measured developmental differences in the relative sizes of visual processing brain regions (optic lobes) among dampwood termite castes to test whether optic lobe investment matches caste differences in exposure to visually complex environments. The winged primary reproductives (Kings/Queens) on mating flights are the only caste to leave the dark nest cavities and as predicted, Kings/Queens showed greater relative investment in optic lobe tissue than nestbound (neotenic) reproductives and soldiers in two dampwood termite species (Zootermopsis angusticollis and Z. nevadensis). Relative optic lobe size spanned more than an order of magnitude among the castes we studied, suggesting the growth of the optic lobes incurs substantial tissue costs. Optic lobe growth was experience-expectant: the optic lobes of Z. angusticollis brachypterous nymphs, which typically develop into Kings/Queens, were relatively larger than the optic lobes of apterous nymphs, which precede neotenics and soldiers, and relative optic lobe size of nestbound brachypterous nymphs was statistically similar to that of Kings/Queens. Experience-expectant brain tissue growth is rarely documented in insects, likely because it entails high potential costs of tissue production and maintenance and relatively low immediate sensory/cognitive benefits. We develop hypotheses for the conditions under which experience-expectant growth in brain regions could be favored by natural selection.","[O'Donnell, Sean; Bulova, Susan; Barrett, Meghan] Drexel Univ, Dept Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19081 USA",Drexel University,"O'Donnell, S (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci & Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19081 USA.",so356@drexel.edu,,,"Drexel College of Arts and Sciences; NSF [IBN 0347315, IOS 0923680]",Drexel College of Arts and Sciences; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was funded by Drexel College of Arts and Sciences and NSF grants IBN 0347315 and IOS 0923680.,,52,6,7,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0028-1042,1432-1904,,SCI NAT-HEIDELBERG,Sci.

Thus, ToM deficits may negatively impact social functioning and warrant consideration in treatment development. However, extant ToM measures may place excessive cognitive demands on people with schizophrenia. Therefore, the study aimed to develop a comprehensible Assessment of ToM for people with Schizophrenia (AToMS) and evaluate its psychometric properties. The AToMs was developed in 5 stages, including item formation, expert review, content validity evaluation, animation production, and cognitive interviews of 25 people with schizophrenia. The psychometric properties of the 16-item AToMS (including reliability and validity) were then tested on 59 people with schizophrenia. The newly developed animated AToMS assesses 8 ToM concepts in the cognitive and affective dimensions while placing minimal neurocognitive demands on people with schizophrenia. The AToMS presented satisfactory psychometric properties, with adequate content validity (content validity index = 0.91); mostly moderate item difficulty (item difficulty index = 0.339-0.966); good discrimination (coefficients = 0.379-0.786), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.850), and reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.901 for test-retest, 0.997 for inter-rater); and satisfactory convergent and divergent validity. The AToMS is reliable and valid for evaluating ToM characteristics in people with schizophrenia. Future studies are warranted to examine the AToMS in other populations (e.g., people with affective disorders) to cross-validate and extend its utility and psychometric evidence.","[Yeh, Ya-Chin] Shu Zen Jr Coll Med & Management, Dept Occupat Therapy, Kaohsiung 821004, Taiwan; [Hung, Chi-Fa] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Coll Med, Sch Med, Kaohsiung 804201, Taiwan; [Hung, Chi-Fa] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Kaohsiung 833401, Taiwan; [Hung, Chi-Fa] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Kaohsiung 833401, Taiwan; [Hung, Chi-Fa] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Pingtung 912301, Taiwan; [Lin, Chung-Ying; Chen, Kuan-Lin] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Allied Hlth Sci, Tainan 701401, Taiwan; [Lin, Chung-Ying; Chen, Kuan-Lin] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Occupat Therapy, Tainan 701401, Taiwan; [Lin, Chung-Ying] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Tainan 701401, Taiwan; [Lin, Chung-Ying] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Biostat Consulting Ctr, Tainan 701401, Taiwan; [Wu, Yuh-Yih] Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Special Educ, Kaohsiung 802561, Taiwan; [Kuo, Chun-Hong] Kaohsiung Municipal Nan Zih Special Sch, Dept Acad Off, Kaohsiung 811214, Taiwan; [Potenza, Marc N.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT USA; [Potenza, Marc N.] Connecticut Mental Hlth Ctr, New Haven, CT 06508 USA; [Potenza, Marc N.] Connecticut Council Problem Gambling, Wethersfield, CT USA; [Potenza, Marc N.] Yale Sch Med, Child Study Ctr, New Haven, CT USA; [Potenza, Marc N.] Yale Univ, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT USA; [Potenza, Marc N.] Yale Univ, Wu Tsai Inst, New Haven, CT USA; [Cheng, Chun-Hua] Kaohsiung Municipal Kai Syuan Psychiat Hosp, Dept Occupat Therapy, Kaohsiung 802211, Taiwan; [Chen, Kuan-Lin] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Tainan 701401, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; National Pingtung University Science & Technology; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital; National Kaohsiung Normal University; Yale University; Yale University; Yale University; Yale University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital,"Lin, CY; Chen, KL (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Allied Hlth Sci, Tainan 701401, Taiwan.;Lin, CY; Chen, KL (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Occupat Therapy, Tainan 701401, Taiwan.;Lin, CY (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Tainan 701401, Taiwan.;Lin, CY (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Biostat Consulting Ctr, Tainan 701401, Taiwan.;Chen, KL (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Coll Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Tainan 701401, Taiwan.",yehyachin@ms.szmc.edu.tw; chifa@cgmh.org.tw; cylin36933@gmail.com; t1850@nknu.edu.tw; ot@nzsmr.kh.edu.tw; marc.potenza@yale.edu; kiwin8070@gmail.com; klchen@mail.ncku.edu.tw,"Potenza, Marc/AFM-2432-2022; Chen, Kuan-Lin/AAD-4537-2022; ?, ??/HPH-1510-2023; Lin, Chung-Ying/I-5434-2016; Cheng, Chunhua/N-4847-2016; Kuo, Chun-Hong/D-8902-2015","Chen, Kuan-Lin/0000-0001-9996-814X; Kuo, Chun-Hong/0000-0001-6633-8985","Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 109-2628-B-006-023, MOST 110-2628-B-006-031]",Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 109-2628-B-006-023 and MOST 110-2628-B-006-031).,,64,1,1,1,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0940-1334,1433-8491,,EUR ARCH PSY CLIN N,Eur.

These errors are usually treated as a sign of a deficit in language competence. On the other hand, some studies have revealed the same kinds of grammatical errors in children with developmental language disorder (DLD) and in typically developed (TD) children. Quite often, DLD children use grammatical markers properly, but sometimes they do this erroneously. It has been suggested that the main area of the limitations in DLD children is language performance but not language competence. From the perspective of the resource deficit model, the error rate in DLD children should be influenced by the cognitive demands of utterance and text production. We presume that different genres of discourse demand a different number of cognitive resources and, thus, should differently impact the error rate in children's speech production. To test our hypothesis, we carried out an error analysis of two corpora of child discourse. The first corpus contained longitudinal data of discourse (personal narratives, fictional stories, chats, and discussions) collected from 12 children at four age points (4 years 3 months., 4 years 8 months., 5 years 3 months., and 5 years 9 months. years). Another corpus contained discourse texts (fictional stories and discussions) collected in the framework of a cross-sectional study from 6-year-old TD and DLD children; the DLD children had language expression but not comprehension difficulties. A comparative analysis between different discourse genres evidenced that the genre of discourse and age of assessment impacted the error distribution in the DLD and TD children. Such variables as the lexical and morphological error rates were impacted the most significantly. The results of the two studies confirmed our hypothesis regarding the probabilistic nature of lexical and grammatical errors in both DLD and TD children and the relationship between a cognitive loading of the genre and the error rate.","[Kornev, Aleksandr N.; Balciuniene, Ingrida] St Petersburg State Pediat Med Univ, Dept Logopathol, St Petersburg 194100, Russia; [Balciuniene, Ingrida] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Lithuanian Studies, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania",Saint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Kornev, AN (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Pediat Med Univ, Dept Logopathol, St Petersburg 194100, Russia.",k1949@yandex.ru; ingrida.balciuniene@vdu.lt,"Bal?i?nien?, Ingrida/O-8751-2019; Kornev, Alexandr/B-6504-2018; Balciuniene, Ingrida/L-9731-2013","Kornev, Alexandr/0000-0002-6406-1238; Balciuniene, Ingrida/0000-0002-8307-1108",Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [19-29-14078],Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"FundingThis research was funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), grant number 19-29-14078.",,88,7,8,6,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9067,,CHILDREN-BASEL,Children-Basel,DEC,2021,8,12,,,,,,,1114,10.3390/children8121114,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/children8121114,,,20,Pediatrics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Pediatrics,XW3YF,34943310,"gold, Green Published",,,11/13/2024,WOS:000735558200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to characterize reserve parachute deployment under radial acceleration to make recommendations for system design and paraglider pilot training. METHODS: There were 88 licensed amateur paraglider pilots who were filmed deploying their reserve parachutes from a centrifuge. Of those, 43 traveled forward at 4 G simulating a spiral dive, and 45 traveled backward at 3 G simulating a rotational maneuver known as 'SAT'. Tests incorporated ecologically valid body, hand, and gaze positions, and cognitive loading and switching akin to real deployment. The footage was reviewed by subject matter experts and compared to previous work in linear acceleration. RESULTS: Of the pilots, 2.3% failed to extract the reserve container from the harness. SAT appeared more cognitively demanding than spiral, despite lower G. Participants located the reserve handle by touch not sight. The direction of travel influenced their initial contact with the harness: 82.9% searched first on their hip in spiral, 63.4% searched first on their thigh in SAT. Search patterns followed skeletal landmarks. Participants had little directional control over their throw. CONCLUSIONS: Paraglider pilots are part of the reserve system. Maladaptive behaviors observed under stress highlighted that components must work in harmony with pilots'natural responses, with minimal cognitive demands or need for innovation or problem-solving. Recommendations include positioning prominent, tactile reserve handles overlying the pilot's hip; deployment bags extractable with any angle of pull; deployment in a single sweeping backward action; and significantly increasing reserve deployment drills.

Thirty-eight healthy adults aged 54 - 80 years (M = 66 years) participated in an fMRI experiment wherein listeners indicated the gender of an agent in short spoken sentences that varied in syntactic complexity (object-relative vs subject-relative center-embedded clause structures) and acoustic richness (high vs low spectral detail, but all intelligible). We found widespread activity throughout a bilateral frontotemporal network during successful sentence comprehension. Consistent with prior reports, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and left posterior superior temporal gyrus were more active in response to object-relative sentences than to subject-relative sentences. Moreover, several regions were significantly correlated with individual differences in task performance: Activity in right frontoparietal cortex and left cerebellum (Crus I & II) showed a negative correlation with overall comprehension. By contrast, left frontotemporal areas and right cerebellum (Lobule VII) showed a negative correlation with accuracy specifically for syntactically complex sentences. In addition, laterality analyses confirmed a lack of hemispheric lateralization in activity evoked by sentence stimuli in older adults. Importantly, we found different hemispheric roles, with a left-lateralized core language network supporting syntactic operations, and right-hemisphere regions coming into play to aid in general cognitive demands during spoken sentence processing. Together our findings support the view that high levels of language comprehension in older adults are maintained by a close interplay between a core left hemisphere language network and additional neural resources in the contralateral hemisphere.

The aim of this study was to confirm this possibility with neurophysiological and self-reported measures. Thirteen participants performed 200 imagined isometric knee extension contractions (Prolonged MI condition) or watched a documentary (Control condition), and then performed 150 actual isometric knee extensions. Electroencephalography was continuously recorded to obtain motor-related cortical potential amplitude at Cz electrode (MRCP, index of motor area activity) for each imagined and actual contraction. Electromyography of the vastus lateralis muscle as well as the perceived effort required to perform prolonged MI, watch the documentary, and perform the actual contractions were measured. During prolonged MI, mental fatigue level, the effort required to imagine the contractions and MRCP amplitude increased over time. The increase in the effort required to imagine the contractions was significantly correlated with the MRCP amplitude. During the physical exercise, a significant condition x time interaction revealed a greater increase over time in perceived effort in the prolonged MI condition compared to the control condition, as well as a specific alteration in EMG RMS of the vastus lateralis muscle. These alterations observed in the presence of mental fatigue during actual contractions, combined with those observed during prolonged MI, suggest that prolonged MI may impair the motor command required to perform imagined or actual contractions. While the observed effect of mental fatigue on MRCP amplitude was clear during MI, future studies should tailor the physical exercise to minimize the exercise-induced decrease in force production capacity and control for its confounding effects on MRCP amplitude in the presence of mental fatigue.","[Jacquet, Thomas; Poulin-Charronnat, Benedicte; Bard, Patrick; Pfister, Philippe] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, LEAD, CNRS, UMR5022, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Lepers, Romuald; Pageaux, Benjamin] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UFR Sci Sport, INSERM, UMR1093,CAPS, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Pageaux, Benjamin] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Ecole Kinesiol & Sci Activite Phys EKSAP, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pageaux, Benjamin] Ctr Rech Inst Univ Geriatr Montreal CRIUGM, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Universite de Bourgogne; Universite de Bourgogne; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Montreal,"Jacquet, T (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, LEAD, CNRS, UMR5022,I3M, 64 Rue Sully, F-21000 Dijon, France.",thomas.jacquet@u-bourgogne.fr,"Poulin-Charronnat, Bénédicte/K-7418-2015; Lepers, Romuald/T-8782-2019; Bard, Patrick/LMN-3283-2024; Pageaux, Benjamin/G-9253-2016","Pageaux, Benjamin/0000-0001-9302-5183; BARD, PATRICK/0000-0001-5464-4766; JACQUET, Thomas/0000-0001-8761-925X; Poulin-Charronnat, Benedicte/0000-0003-3244-6747",,,,,97,22,22,4,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0028-3932,1873-3514,,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,Neuropsychologia,8-Jan,2021,150,,,,,,,,107701,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107701,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107701,,,13,"Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology,QK3HQ,33276035,Green Submitted,,,11/13/2024,WOS:000620272000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Successful adoption of AVs can reduce drivers' stress and fatigue, curb traffic congestion, and improve safety, mobility, and economic efficiency. Due to the limited intelligence in relevant technologies, human-in-the-loop modalities are still necessary to ensure the safety of AVs at current or near future stages, because the vehicles may not be able to handle all emergencies. Therefore, it is important to know the takeover readiness of the drivers to ensure the takeover quality and avoid any potential accidents. To achieve this, a comprehensive understanding of the drivers' physiological states is crucial. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the correlation between different human physiological responses and takeover behaviors which could serve as important references for future studies to determine the types of data to use. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of takeover behaviors on the common physiological indicators. A program for conditional automation was developed based on a game engine and applied to a driving simulator. The experiment incorporated three types of secondary tasks, three takeover events, and two traffic densities. Brain signals, Skin Conductance Level (SCL), and Heart Rate (HR) of the participants were collected while they were performing the driving simulations. The Frontal Asymmetry Index (FAI) (as an indicator of engagement) and Mental Workload (MWL) were calculated from the brain signals to indicate the mental states of the participants. The results revealed that the FAI of the drivers would slightly decrease after the takeover alerts were issued when they were doing secondary tasks prior to the takeover activities, and the higher difficulty of the secondary tasks could lead to lower overall FAI during the takeover periods. In contrast, The MWL and SCL increased during the takeover periods. The HR also increased rapidly at the beginning of the takeover period but dropped back to a normal level quickly. It was found that a fake takeover alert would lead to lower overall HR, slower increase, and lower peak of SCL during the takeover periods. Moreover, the higher traffic density scenarios were associated with higher MWL, and a more difficult secondary task would lead to higher MWL and HR during the takeover activities. A preliminary discussion of the correlation between the physiological data, takeover scenario, and vehicle data (that relevant to takeover readiness) was then conducted, revealing that although takeover event, SCL, and HR had slightly higher correlations with the maximum acceleration and reaction time, none of them dominated the takeover readiness. In addition, the analysis of the data across different participants was conducted, which emphasized the importance of considering standardization or normalization of the data when they were further used as input features for estimating takeover readiness. Overall, the results presented in this paper offer profound insights into the patterns of physiological data changes during takeover periods. These findings can be used as benchmarks for utilizing these variables as indicators of takeover preparedness and performance in future research endeavors.","[Deng, Min; Menassa, Carol C.; Kamat, Vineet R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gluck, Aaron; Brinkley, Julian] Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Zhao, Yijin; Li, Da] Clemson Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Clemson University; Clemson University,"Menassa, CC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",mindeng@umich.edu; amgluck@g.clemson.edu; yijinz@g.clemson.edu; dli3@clemson.edu; menassa@umich.edu; vkamat@umich.edu; julianbrinkley@clemson.edu,,"Gluck, Aaron/0000-0001-6002-8513; Kamat, Vineet/0000-0003-0788-5588",Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) [69A3551747105],Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT),The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support for this research received from the Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) (69A3551747105) .

However, it is unclear how these potential benefits of augmentation affect drivers' distraction from the driving task and their level of workload. Since gaze detection cannot separate glances at AR-elements from glances at the driving scene, new evaluation criteria are needed for measuring the distraction potential of AR-elements. The paper evaluates a methodology based on the Detection Response Task (DRT) for measuring the distraction and workload effects of three different display technologies: Head-Down Display (HDD), Head-Up Display (HUD), and Augmented-Reality HUD (AR-HUD). The DRT measures cognitive and visual workload based on a recognition-response task using the two parameters, reaction time and misses. Two experimental studies using driving simulation (N = 24) and production vehicles in real traffic (N = 24) are reported. As use cases, the subjects had to navigate through an urban traffic environment and pass different intersections. During that they were assisted by navigation systems based on the above mentioned display technologies. The resulting workload is compared to a baseline drive without the need to navigate and a reference drive in which the subjects had to work on a secondary task while driving. The results of the DRT are compared with subjective measures, gaze behaviour, and driving performance. In addition, drivers' preference and user experience regarding the three display technologies and their feedback concerning the DRT method were assessed. The results of both experimental studies show that drivers prefer the AR-HUD display technology. Reasons are mainly the hedonic aspects of the AR-HUD such as the novelty of the technology. Nevertheless, drivers report that AR-elements could obstruct important areas of the road and distract more from the driving task than HUDs. The subjective and visual-cognitive workload measured by the DRT do not differ between the HMI conditions. An analysis for each type of intersection yields most misses for the AR-HUD condition and fewest misses in the HDD condition. However, visual workload (i.e. eyes-off-road time) is higher for HDD compared to (AR-)HUD. Feedback by participants reveals that the DRT as a method for workload assessment is well accepted. All in all, the two DRT measures, misses and reaction time, allow a valid and objective workload measurement and could serve as a supplement or substitute for gaze analysis. The discussion gives indications for the measurement of workload effects caused by AR-HUD using DRT.","[Maag, Christian; Schoemig, Nadja; Neukum, Alexandra] Wuerzburg Inst Traff Sci WIVW GmbH, Wurzburg, Germany; [Naujoks, Frederik; Karl, Ines; Keinath, Andreas] BMW Grp, Munich, Germany",BMW AG,"Maag, C (corresponding author), Wuerzburg Inst Traff Sci WIVW GmbH, Wurzburg, Germany.",maag@wivw.de,"Naujoks, Frederik/K-4917-2019; Keinath, Andreas/O-3490-2017",,BMW AG,BMW AG,This research has been funded by the BMW AG.
