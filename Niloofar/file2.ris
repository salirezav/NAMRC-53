AB  - With the recent vision of Industry 5.0, the cognitive capability of robots plays a crucial role in advancing proactive human–robot collaborative assembly. As a basis of the mutual empathy, the understanding of a human operator’s intention has been primarily studied through the technique of human action recognition. Existing deep learning-based methods demonstrate remarkable efficacy in handling information-rich data such as physiological measurements and videos, where the latter category represents a more natural perception input. However, deploying these methods in new unseen assembly scenarios requires first collecting abundant case-specific data. This leads to significant manual effort and poor flexibility. To deal with the issue, this paper proposes a novel cross-domain few-shot learning method for data-efficient multimodal human action recognition. A hierarchical data fusion mechanism is designed to jointly leverage the skeletons, RGB images and depth maps with complementary information. Then a temporal CrossTransformer is developed to enable the action recognition with very limited amount of data. Lightweight domain adapters are integrated to further improve the generalization with fast finetuning. Extensive experiments on a real car engine assembly case show the superior performance of proposed method over state-of-the-art regarding both accuracy and finetuning efficiency. Real-time demonstrations and ablation study further indicate the potential of early recognition, which is beneficial for the robot procedures generation in practical applications. In summary, this paper contributes to the rarely explored realm of data-efficient human action recognition for proactive human–robot collaboration.

AB  - As Industry 4.0 and 5.0 evolve to be highly automated but human-centric, there is a need for process modeling based on digital replicas of physical objects including humans. Knowledge distillation and cognitive cloning offer a way to train operational copies of decision-making black boxes, or donors, without requiring additional data. In this paper, we propose an architecture and analytics for a generative adversarial network, called Cloning-GAN, which enables donor-clone knowledge transfer, including the donor's individual biases. The architecture involves generating challenging samples to be labeled by the donor and used as training data for the clone. We consider several multicriteria requirements for the generated data, including closeness to the decision boundary, uniform distribution in the decision space, maximal confusion for the donor, and challenge for the clone. We present various strategies to balance these conflicting criteria forcing the clone learning quickly the hidden cognitive skills and biases of the donor.

AB  - The transition from automated processes to mechanisms that manifest intelligence through cognitive abilities such as memorisation, adaptability and decision-making in uncertain contexts, has marked a turning point in the field of industrial systems, particularly in the development of cyber–physical systems and digital twins. This evolution, supported by advances in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, has opened the way to a new era in which systems are able to adapt and evolve autonomously, while offering more intuitive interaction with human users. This article proposes a systematic literature review to gather and analyse current research on Cognitive Cyber–Physical Systems (CCPS), Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT), and cognitive interoperability, which are pivotal in a contemporary Cyber–Physical Enterprise (CPE). From this review, we first seek to understand how cognitive capabilities that are traditionally considered as human traits have been defined and modelled in cyber–physical systems and digital twins in the context of Industry 4.0/5.0, and what cognitive functions they implement. We explore their theoretical foundations, in particular in relation to cognitive psychology and humanities definitions and theories. Then we analyse how interoperability between cognitive systems has been considered, leading to cognitive interoperability, and we highlight the role of knowledge representation and reasoning.

AB  - Nowadays, even though cognitive control architectures form an important area of research, there are many constraints on the broad application of cognitive control at an industrial level and very few systematic approaches truly inspired by biological processes, from the perspective of control engineering. Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept. The proof of concept of force control yields good transient responses, short settling times and acceptable steady-state error. The artificial cognitive control architecture built into a low-cost computing platform demonstrates the suitability of its implementation in an industrial setup.

AB  - Industrial process automation is becoming more advance due to the new technological revolutions like Industrial Internet of things (IIoT), Machine to Machine Communication (M2M), cloud computing, cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and big little multicore-based ARM processors for embedded applications. Modern IP-enabled sensors, actuators, and controllers are transforming industrial automation into industry 5.0 compliances to attain full autonomy with minimal human intervention. With these emerging technologies, Smart Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) is the most important part of the fourth industrial revolution, where diffident programmed embedded systems are networked together to perform, computation, communication, control, and actuation. In this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous architecture for SCPS, where different electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes can be integrated to execute hybrid process dynamics. The proposed architecture is enabled to separate all aspects like computation, control, communication, and actuation, of a process dynamic by estimating the process disturbances, sensor delay, actuator delay, and conversion delay. The allotment of computational embedded cores to different physical processes is done through voltage frequency islands (VFI) with high modularity which is different for different processes. All the mapped process dynamics are optimized through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). The best implementation of the proposed architecture is the upcoming era of industry 5.0 where human intervention is also in a fold in various industries like petroleum, fertilizer, paper, cement, space exploration, and automobile manufacturing.

AB  - It is uncertain how the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology transforms industrial work. We address this question from the perspective of cognitive systems, which, in this case, includes considerations of AI and process transparency, resilience, division of labor, and worker skills. We draw from a case study on glass tempering that includes a machine-vision-based quality control system and an advanced automation process control system. Based on task analysis and background literature, we develop the concept of hybrid intelligence that implies balanced AI transparency that supports upskilling and resilience. So-called fragmented intelligence, in turn, may result from the combination of the complexity of advanced automation along with the complexity of the process physics that places critical emphasis on expert knowledge. This combination can result in the so-called “double black box effect”, given that designing for understandability for the line workers might not be feasible: expert networks are needed for resilience.

AB  - The continued growth of the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) paves the way for the fifth industrial revolution (Industry 5.0), which is expected to further enhance the wireless connectivity and human machine collaboration. Nonetheless, Industry 5.0 will inevitably face the great challenges such as large scale connectivity and explosive data traffic because of the proliferation of IoT devices. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based overlay cognitive radio (OCR) network for Industry 5.0. Specifically, the hybrid full-duplex (FD)/ half-duplex (HD) mode at the secondary user (SR) is adopted and in-phase and quadrature phase imbalance (IQI) is introduced to better comply with the practical scenarios. We investigate the outage probability (OP) and ergodic sum rate (ESR) of the considered network with the Nakagami-m channels. Extensive simulation experiments are performed to verify the accuracy of the analysis. From the simulation results, we can conclude: i) Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), OP decreases but ESR increases and tends to a fixed value at high SNR regimes, indicating that the existence of IQI leads to a ceiling for the ESR; ii) The primary system has higher reliable performance at low SNR regions when SR is in FD mode, and for ergodicity, the system with FD relay is superior to HD relay; iii) The reliable performance of OMA system for primary users will be better since there is no interference at the relay.

AB  - Human-machine work system (HMWS) represents a composite system that integrates machine precision and strength with human cognitive abilities, flexibility, and adaptability, aiming to achieve enhanced performance in various tasks aligned with a common goal, which is getting smarter in the era of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and has received extensive attention from academia and industry. However, the lack of real-time information sharing during HMWS implementation and operation, coupled with uncertainties stemming from human instability and the complexities introduced by smart networking environments in the context of I4.0, poses challenges to the synchronous coordination of this distributed human-centric manufacturing system. Failure in synchronization not only compromises overall system integrity, leading to unrealistic decision-making and potential harm to human health but also goes against the principles of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which proposes placing human well-being at the center of the production process for human-centric smart manufacturing in the future. In this context, this research presents real-time data-driven hyper objects orchestrating for the human-machine synchronization (RHYTHMS) based on a service-oriented human-to-machine architecture (SOH2M) and a model reference adaptive fuzzy control for real-time information sharing and synchronous coordination of the smart HMWS. Based on these, a real-life assembly case is carried out by a full-scale HMWS prototype to quantitatively analyze the benefits of the proposed approach in proactive ergonomic risk mitigation (PERM), contributing to the human-centric value-oriented I5.0 era.

AB  - Over the last decades, a significant effort has been allocated by the research community towards improving robot capabilities. These emerged robot cognitive and perception abilities have been driving the swift of production paradigm from rigid automation systems to hybrid and collaborative working environments. Nevertheless, the adoption of robots in lower volume, diverse manufacturing environments is still constrained, due to a) the high integration and deployment complexity of end-to-end integrated robotic applications, b) the limited flexibility of existing solutions in dealing with unexpected events in a dynamic way. This paper presents a modular service-oriented architecture for robotic resources that aims to address those limitations by a) creating digital models, semantically characterizing all production entities and processes in a unified way, b) deploy open interfaces allowing the communication of all robotics hardware and control systems, c) dynamically plan and orchestrate manufacturing operations execution by the involved human and robot resources, and d) collectively share the resources’ perceived environment. The overall system includes the integration of task planning, perception, actuation, and robot control modules while Augmented Reality (AR) based interfaces has been considered for including human operators in the loop. The described architecture has been tested and validated in a case study inspired from the automotive industry.

AB  - A layered model of the mammalian cortex is an accepted one. One of the major challenges of using this architecture in real-life use cases is the lack of reliable implementations of the symbolic and cognitive layers. On another parallel stream, the adoption of cognitive and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in industries has been slow. One of the reasons for this is the fact that the current generation of AI architectures does not sufficiently take care of the perception levels of the human operator. This paper presents an architecture that solves both of the above challenges. We propose a cognitive architecture where a natural-human in loop replaces most of the symbolic and cognitive layers. At the same time, we propose the use of instrumentation to measure the perceptual level of the human in real-time. This enables us to bridge the symbolic non-symbolic gap to some extent as well. Lastly, the perception-centric block also adds a novel attribute to the existing AI architectures. The current generation of AI algorithms does not incorporate the users’ perception as an integral part of the training and operation of the algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first time user perception is an essential part of the algorithm. We call this architecture Perception-Centric Human-in-loop Cognitive Architecture (PeC-HiCA). PeC-HiCA is not only a more implementable cognitive architecture, it will also be more successful in industrial applications.

AB  - Wooden-house assembly is an area where still a big part of the work is done manually. In this case study, pairs of operators compose large wooden pieces together based on paper-print instructions complemented by visual guidance in the shape of laser marks projected from lasers mounted in the ceiling, based on Computer-aided design (CAD) data. Augmented Reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMD) offer a unique platform for providing instructions and additional information superimposed in the work environment and thus can provide guidance in a cognitively ergonomic way. A particular advantage compared to other computing platforms is that the operators have free hands and can perform the manual work and follow guidance simultaneously. We present an evaluation of a prototype that dynamically transforms a CAD data file with design and measurements of wooden trusses to be manufactured, into an AR-based guidance system developed in Unity for Microsoft HoloLens 2 devices. We used an iterative participatory design process for prototyping and think-aloud protocol combined with observations for evaluation, involving professional assemblers in different stages of the process. Participants found the solution to potentially save time in their everyday work and simplify the task by offering increased visibility of the marks compared to the existing laser projection. Large-scale deployment of the system is still facing design challenges of which some are also discussed in the paper.

AB  - As the manufacturing industry becomes more agile, the use of collaborative robots capable of safely working with humans is becoming more prevalent, while adaptable and natural interaction is a goal yet to be achieved. This work presents a cognitive architecture composed of perception and reasoning modules that allows a robot to adapt its actions while collaborating with humans in an assembly task. Human action recognition perception is performed using convolutional neural network models with inertial measurement unit and skeleton tracking data. The action predictions are used for task status reasoning which predicts the time left for each action in a task allowing a robot to plan future actions. The task status reasoning uses a recurrent neural network method which is developed for transferability to new actions and tasks. Updateable input parameters allowing the system to optimise for each user and task with each trial performed are also investigated. Finally, the complete system is demonstrated with the collaborative assembly of a small chair and wooden box, along with a solo robot task of stacking objects performed when it would otherwise be idle. The human actions recognised are using a screw driver, Allen key, hammer and hand screwing, with online accuracies between 83–92%. User trials demonstrate the robot deciding when to start collaborative actions in order to synchronise with the user, as well as deciding when it has time to complete an action on its solo task before a collaborative action is required.

However, some problems related to the cognitive level during the human interaction process still exist, which may hinder the manufacturing accuracy and efficiency, and even present a potential threat to humans who work in the same workspace. Therefore, this study conducts an in-depth survey on current non-exhaustive cognitive technologies such as sensing, motion planning, artificial intelligence, and human-inspired technologies, which are the key aspects for improving the cognitive level of robotic manufacturing systems in HRI. In addition, considering the limitations of current cognitive technologies, the authors present a multidisciplinary cognitive framework to improve the cognitive level of robotic manufacturing systems for intelligent HRI.

AB  - Operator training is critical to ensure safe operation in safety-critical domains such as chemical process industries. Training enhances the operator's understanding of the process, which is then encapsulated as mental models. Typically, the operator's learning in traditional training programs is assessed using expert judgment or in terms of process- and operator action-based metrics. These assessment schemes, however, ignore the cognitive aspects of learning, such as mental model development and cognitive workload. The HMM-based model proposed in Part 1 offers a systematic way to quantify operators' cognition during abnormalities. In this Part 2, we show that the cognitive behaviors displayed by expert operators can be represented as target values on the HMM's state transitions and emission probability distributions. Further, we propose two axioms of learning that can capture the evolution of the operator's mental models as they learn the causal relationships in the process and gain expertise in handling abnormal situations. We validate the proposed axioms by conducting training experiments involving 10 participants performing 486 tasks. Our results reveal that the axioms can accurately assess the progress of operators' learning.

AB  - Over the last few years, the Human Factors and Ergonomics (HF/E) discipline has significantly benefited from new human-centric engineered digital solutions of the 4.0 industrial age. Technologies are creating new socio-technical interactions between human and machine that minimize the risk of design-induced human errors and have largely contributed to remarkable improvements in terms of process safety, productivity, quality, and workers’ well-being. However, despite the Oil&Gas (O&G) sector is one of the most hazardous environments where human error can have severe consequences, Industry 4.0 aspects are still scarcely integrated with HF/E. This paper calls for a holistic understanding of the changing role and responsibilities of workers in the O&G industry and aims at investigating to what extent, what type of, and how academic publications in the O&G field integrate HF/E and Industry 4.0 in their research. Bibliometric analysis has been conducted to provide useful insights to researchers and practitioners and to assess the status quo. Our findings show that academic publications have mainly focused on simulation-based training to increase process safety whereas revealed the lack of specific studies on the application of cognitive solutions, such as Augmented Reality-enabled tools or Intelligent Fault Detection and Alarm Management solutions.

AB  - Operator Support Systems (OSSs) that support operators during highly time-critical asphalt compaction operations provide them with real-time sensory data. Nonetheless, the conventional asphalt compaction OSSs tend to cognitively overload operators with information that requires much human interpretation on the fly. To address the problem of OSSs' infobesity, the transition to a higher level of system automation that prescribes actions, i.e., prescriptive guidance, can be considered. To this end, this research aims to develop a novel compaction trajectory planning method that can be used to implement the Prescriptive Guidance mode in asphalt compaction OSSs. The proposed method analyzes the compaction and temperature profiles of the asphalt in real-time and suggests a compaction trajectory that ensures compaction efficiency and continuity. The proposed method is developed and compared to other types of asphalt compaction OSSs in two case studies. It is shown that while prescriptive asphalt compaction OSSs have a clear edge over more conventional OSSs in terms of improving compaction efficiency (i.e., more than 50% increase in compaction efficiency), there are still technology adoption and cultural issues that may affect the acceptance of this new technology in practice. The main contribution of this research is that it generates insights into (1) how to develop actionable and prescriptive compaction guidance, and (2) the interplay between the experience level of machine operators and the effectiveness of different support modes of asphalt compaction OSSs.

The introduced system contributes to industrial digitization and creation of smart factories by providing a generic platform which is a complete solution supporting standards-based factory connectivity, data management, various AI models training and comparisons, live predictions and real-time visualizations. The proposed system is built on a micro-service architecture, in order to be extendable and adaptive over time, and contains three core modules, the Data Acquisition, the Knowledge Management and the Predictive maintenance, which contribute to machine failure prediction and activate predictive maintenance procedures, to efficient production schemes and decision making, to monitor anomalies and handle unforeseen conditions, to predict future behaviours on time series etc. The proposed platform utilizes continuous re-training mechanisms enabling a self learning approach for the delivery of AI solutions, usable also for various production data, guaranteeing the quality of results without continuous monitoring and human-resources allocation for AI models’ retraining. This cognitive platform is supported by machine learning techniques and deep learning architectures in order to achieve the desired performance in the management of factory processes and needs. All the information generated by the proposed platform is provided to the end user through a user interface that utilizes advanced visualization techniques.

AB  - The metaverse is an immersive virtual space that enables users to meet each other virtually as an avatar and to interact with the virtual environment whatever their location. The metaverse approach is mainly based on the virtual reality (VR) technology enhanced with multiplayer capability. VR enables, due to its high immersive and interactive capabilities, a realistic experience of complex and abstract technical systems which leads to the support of the human cognitive abilities in observing their behavior. The advantages of VR have been recognized by the industry in the last few years. As a result, numerous industrial companies worldwide have founded initiatives with research institutions and start-ups to investigate the application of VR and the metaverse. This paper presents and discusses the implementation and the application of an industrial metaverse approach based on VR for the design review of a pharmaceutical vial filling machine.

This powerful capability is instrumental to boost robots' adoption within typically manual manufacturing contexts, by enhancing productivity while preserving human safety and job quality. The deliberative feature relies upon a modular planning and control infrastructure linked to a behavioral tree framework determining the robot response to the operating context and the human physical and cognitive status. The benefits of the approach have been validated through an industrial use case demanding enhanced human-robot collaboration in the electronics assembly value chain.

AB  - Smart manufacturing systems have to meet high performance expectations in form of customer individual products, short lead times, high due date reliability and resilience by the integration of new technologies and by intelligent process design. The planning and control of such smart manufacturing systems necessitates several instances of human decision-making. The latest research at the nexus of operations management and psychology reveals that human decision-making in such fast-paced, dynamic and complex environments is often biased, resulting in suboptimal operational performance. Human-centered design of planning and control processes can mitigate biased decisions, thus boosting performance in smart manufacturing systems. Current research is silent about the impact and mitigation of cognitive biases in operations management, though. We intend to close this research gap. We combine systematic reviews of literature on behavioral operations management and cognitive biases in operations management, particularly in production planning and control with an in-depth case study based on 12 expert interviews. We explore two decision-making models and combine them in a PPC framework. We create a framework for human-centered PPC in smart manufacturing systems, which includes the main impact factors, challenges and performance capabilities. Based on a detailed case study of a steel producer, we present a framework of human-centered PPC comprising five hypotheses on the impact of cognitive biases on human decision-making and on manufacturing performance.

AB  - The global trend toward customization in the automotive sector has led to significant increase in the variability of components available to the assembly process. The increase in product variability directly impacts the complexity of the manufacturing process and consequently increases the possibility for human-generated error. Several solutions have been offered to reduce the potential risk of error in complex assembly processes which can be generalized as cognitive-based or physical-based assistive methods. Creating a digital twin of the process, both the human and machine elements, is a preliminary requirement before deploying such solutions in a real-world manufacturing environment. The digital twin simulation provides a platform for testing a variety of solutions and what-if scenarios to improve planning and decision making. While there exist commercially available products of human digital twin modeling, these do not provide a proper platform for human – machine interaction modeling. In the context of this work, machine is defined as an industrial robot with an objective of investigating the feasibility of deploying a smart collaborative robotic solution to provide physical assistance to the human worker in a cumbersome manufacturing process. To do so, an overhead assembly operation from a real-world vehicle assembly plant is identified, and a digital twin of human model is created in Siemens Tecnomatix suite. The study starts with the simulation of various human anthropomorphic models to discover the limitations in performing the assembly tasks based on gender, weight and height. Furthermore, a digital twin of a mobile robot designed to provide physical assistance to the human to perform the assembly operation is introduced. The results are evaluated in terms of process time, joint ergonomic impact and reveal some current limitations of combined digital twin modeling of humans and robots collaborating.

AB  - The increasing diversity of variants and the high product complexity pose ever-greater challenges for manufacturing companies, especially in assembly. Therefore, assembly assistance systems are increasingly used to manage complexity in terms of guiding workers through assembly processes. Previous research work in this context has mainly focused on the assessment and improvement of typical assistance functions as well as their implementation. The integration of active knowledge management on both shopfloor and planning level illustrates a high potential for the extension and development of new assistance functions. However, the possibility of using informational assistance systems to implement active knowledge management in industrial assembly has not been sufficiently studied yet. Therefore, this paper firstly defines the main challenges of the integration, which are summarized in a negative cycle of knowledge management in assembly, and secondly describes the key requirements for knowledge management in conjunction with assembly assistance systems. Using these requirements, the paper finally presents a conceptual framework and the implementation in an informational assembly assistance system.

AB  - In the dynamic landscape of industrial workplaces, the demand for maintenance personnel capable of handling non-routine tasks has become increasingly crucial. However, traditional training programs, structured in pre-established sessions and relying on real equipment with expert technicians working alongside learners, are limited in their ability to establish a connection with the moment of effective performance and maintain effectiveness, which may diminish over time due to the forgetting phenomenon if conducted well in advance. Recognizing the pivotal roles of experience and training in mitigating human errors during maintenance tasks, as well as the limitations in current training practices, this study aims to propose a novel prescriptive training model and discuss practical managerial implications. This model leverages prescriptive analytics and cognitive-based learning models with the aim of generating training sessions tailored to the specific needs of maintenance tasks and calibrated to the operator’s expertise level. The ultimate goal is to develop the basic model for an adaptive training system, utilizing advanced technologies to enhance the performance of workers and reduce the risk of errors in non-routine tasks.

AB  - Modern manufacturing systems are often composed of a variety of highly customized units and specifically designed manufacturing cells. Optimization of assembly and training of staff requires a series of demo installations and excessive use of costly operational resources. In some cases, components are located at different sites, making the orchestration of the whole system even more difficult. Virtual Reality (VR) collaboration environments offer a solution by enabling high fidelity testing and training of complex manufacturing systems. On the other hand, such platforms are difficult to implement in an engineering perspective, as they are required to provide reliable, standard interfaces towards both robotic components and human operators. The VirCA (Virtual Collaboration Arena) platform is a software framework that supports various means of collaboration through the use of 3D augmented/virtual reality as a communication medium. VirCA offers functions for the high-level interoperability of heterogeneous components in a wide range of domains, spanning from research & development, through remote education to orchestration and management of industrial processes in manufacturing applications. This paper provides an overview of the industrial requirements behind high-fidelity virtual collaboration and demonstrates how the VirCA platform meets these requirements. Use cases are provided to illustrate the usability of the platform.

AB  - Safe collaboration between a robotic and human agent is an important challenge yet to be fully overcome in a manufacturing set-up. Existing strategies, including safety zoning are sub-optimal since they seldom fully exploit the capabilities of the collaborative robot (for repetitive tasks) and highly cognitive tasks (best suited for the operator). The recently released ISO 15066 standard for collaborative robots proposes varying safeguards, including force, speed and distance limiting functions. The latter is particularly attractive as it allows the robotic agent to adapt its operating behaviour in proximity of the operator and in instances likely to lead to safety hazards. This paper discusses strategies explored for implementing dynamic zoning in shared workspaces, considering the input speed/force of the robot as dependent on the distance between human and robot. Two main strategies were modelled, for implementing zoning. The first strategy explored integrating a LiDAR sensor, and utilising LiDAR data to dynamically map the separation distances between the operator and robotic agent. The second strategy explores an experimental setup utilising the Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor for capturing 3D point clouds, and in turn, detecting objects/agents and the proximity distance. In both instances, objects/agents were detected up to a separation distance threshold, considering error sensitivity below values of 0.1 meters. Both use cases were demonstrated using a Yumi robot and form the basis of future work towards dynamic workspace zoning.

AB  - Production systems in industries are undergoing transformative changes, with the rise of Industry 4.0 technologies amplifying the complexity of manual and semi-automated workstations, necessitating advanced training and adaptability from human workers. Human workers, due to their unique blend of cognitive and motor skills, thus flexibility, are indispensable and will continue to play a pivotal role. Because of their unique experiences and attributes, they inherently exhibit variability in their processing times and learning rates, which complicates frequent production ramp-ups. Recognizing the lack of comprehensive models that simultaneously account for stochastic processing times and heterogeneous learning during production ramp-ups, this study aims to bridge this gap. We developed an analytical model of a two-worker production system with an intermediate buffer by focusing on worker learning curves, stochastic processing times, and learning heterogeneity. Through an illustrative case, we derived insights into the performance of such systems, specifically in terms of measures including the mean throughput time of a batch, mean waiting time of a part in the buffer, mean idle time of workers, work-in-progress distribution, and buffer usage during the production run. We found that deterministic learning models can significantly underestimate the throughput times, and even consistent average learning rates can lead to variable throughput times based on the learning patterns. Our findings emphasize the need for production managers to consider these factors for realistic and effective production planning, underscoring the novelty of our approach in addressing these intricate dynamics to improve not only system performance, but also worker well-being.

AB  - As the nature of manufacturing work is changing, requiring more cognitive demands, there is a need to develop system models for measuring and predicting human performance in repetitive task operations. This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATB, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks.
Relevance to industry
This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity.

AB  - Smart manufacturing is being shaped nowadays by two different paradigms: Industry 4.0 proclaims transition to digitalization and automation of processes while emerging Industry 5.0 emphasizes human centricity. This turn can be explained by unprecedented challenges being faced recently by societies, such as, global climate change, pandemics, hybrid and conventional warfare, refugee crises. Sustainable and resilient processes require humans to get back into the loop of organizational decision-making. In this paper, we argue that the most reasonable way to marry the two extremes of automation and value-based human-driven processes is to create an Industry 4.0 + Industry 5.0 hybrid, which inherits the most valuable features of both - efficiency of the Industry 4.0 processes and sustainability of the Industry 5.0 decisions. Digital cognitive clones twinning human decision-making behavior are represented as an enabling technology for the future hybrid and as an accelerator (as well as resilience enabler) of the convergence of the digital and human worlds.

AB  - The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies must consider the place of the operator in the production. In this paper, we adopt a human-machine cooperation perspective for modelling operator 4.0 in industrial systems. Our approach is supported by Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) method. We used three phases of the CWA: Work Domain Analysis (WDA), Control Task Analysis (ConTA), and Social Organization and Cooperation Analysis (SOCA), to model the functional and cognitive constraints as well as the function allocation. The paper especially uses two modeling tools - Abstraction Hierarchy and Decision Ladder - that could support the positioning and the design of Technology 4.0-based assistance systems. This model is applied to the specific activity of orders picking. This activity integrates both function of planning and organization of the different production lots and these functions can be shared between order picker 4.0 and specific Industry 4.0 technologies.

AB  - Construction is one of the most hazardous industries, in part because it involves dynamic and cognitively demanding tasks that tax workers' mental resources. Though some previous studies showed increases in workers' mental load can adversely affect the safety-critical function of workers' situational awareness, limited previous work has utilized machine learning (ML) techniques for mental load classification models with Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals to passively identify at-risk workers suffering excessive mental loads. Within an immersive mixed-reality environment simulating an electrical construction task, this study employed ensemble modeling to classify workers' mental load via their fNIRS-captured brain activation. Beyond identifying the prefrontal and motor cortices as the most important brain areas contributing to ML-driven mental load classifications when using fNIRS, this paper also proposes a mental load classification methodology that synthesizes neuroimaging data with individuals' risk-propensity scores to address the limitations of existing personalized and generalized ML models. The results reveal better performance for fNIRS-based mental load classifications given participants' personal risk propensity (risk-seeker and risk-averse). This research, therefore, (1) offers valuable insights into the importance of identifying at-risk workers who are more likely to experience impaired cognitive processing and situational awareness due to increased mental load, and (2) sheds light on reliable pipelines for developing fNIRS-based mental load classification.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is a trend related to smart factories, which are cyber-physical spaces populated and controlled by the collective intelligence for the autonomous and highly flexible manufacturing purposes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.

AB  - Industrial tabular information extraction and its semantic fusion with text (ITIESF) is of great significance in converting and fusing industrial unstructured data into structured knowledge to guide cognitive intelligence analysis in the manufacturing industry. A novel end-to-end ITIESF approach is proposed to integrate tabular information and construct a tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph (TCEEKG). Specifically, an end-to-end joint learning strategy is presented to mine the semantic information in tables. The definition and modeling method of the intrinsic relationships between tables with their rows and columns in engineering documents are provided to model the tabular information. Due to this, an end-to-end joint entity relationship extraction method for textual and tabular information from engineering documents is proposed to construct text-based knowledge graphs (KG) and tabular information-based causality event evolutionary graphs (CEEG). Then, a novel NSGCN (neighborhoods sample graph convolution network)-based entity alignment is proposed to fuse the cross-knowledge graphs into a unified knowledge base. Furthermore, a translation-based graph structure-driven Q&A (question and answer) approach is designed to respond to cause analysis and problem tracing. Our models can be easily integrated into a prototype system to provide a joint information processing and cognitive analysis. Finally, the approach is evaluated by employing the aerospace machining documents to illustrate that the TCEEKG can considerably help workers strengthen their skills in the cause-and-effect analysis of machining quality issues from a global perspective.

AB  - There is a growing interest in exploring the use of wearable Augmented Reality (AR) devices to improve the task performance of construction workers. However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry.

AB  - Sustainable Manufacturing (SM) traditionally focused on optimization of environmental and economic aspects, by neglecting the human performance. However, the industrial plant's costs, productivity and process quality highly depend on the individual human performance (e.g., comfort perceived, physical and mental workload, simplicity of actions, personal satisfaction) and how much hazardous positions and uncomfortable tasks finally cost to the company. The present paper defines a human-centred virtual simulation environment to optimize physical ergonomics in workstation design and demonstrates its benefits on an industrial case study in pipe industry. The proposed environment aims at overcoming traditional approaches, where analysis are carried out at the shop-floor when the plant is already created, by providing a virtual environment to easily test and verify different design solutions to optimize physical, cognitive and organizational ergonomics.

AB  - Cyber threats are targeting vulnerabilities of human workers performing tasks in manufacturing processes, including visual inspection to bias their decision-making, thereby sabotaging product quality. This article examines the use of priming as a form of “cognitive hacking” to adversely affect quality inspection decisions in manufacturing, and investigates physiological measurements as means to detect such intrusion. In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection.

AB  - Since the start of industrialization, machine capabilities have increased in such a way that human control of processes has evolved from simple (with mechanization) to cognitive (with computerization), and even emotional (with semi/full automation). The processes have also evolved from simple to complicated, and now complex systems, in the emerging context of Industry 4.0. This is notably the case with Intelligent Manufacturing Systems in which processes have become so autonomous that humans are unaware of the processes running, while they may need to intervene to update the manufacturing plan or modify the process configuration if a machine breaks down, or to assist process-intelligent entities when they find themselves in a deadlock. This paper highlights the lack of attention paid to the correct integration of humans in Intelligent Manufacturing Systems and provides solutions based on Human-Machine Cooperation principles to retain humans in the process control loop with different levels of involvement identified by the levels of automation. The aim of these principles is to propose a human-centered approach to design and evaluate systems, processes, and their interactions with humans. Herein, these principles are detailed and applied to Intelligent Manufacturing Systems using Artificial Self-Organizing systems (ASO) as an example. An assistance system was designed to support cooperation between ASO and human operators. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system and its utility in improving the performance of Human-Machine Systems, as well as its acceptability with regard to human factors. The results presented highlight the advantages of the approach within the context of Industry 4.0.

Adaptive factory automation and management solutions integrating the man in the loop are proposed in order to achieve production performance, workers safety and well being in a balanced way in varying boundary and exogenous conditions. Particularly, this paper presents new methods and the related recent case studies in different sectors.

A thorough literature review and research findings indicate the new technologies that can be considered for mitigating these disparities. This paper then presents a case study for achieving high quality reliable e-axle bearings through a developed data-driven Bearing Test Rig (BTR). The second case study indicates the feasibility of high variety assembly of products in an e-axle through a cobot that is utilized for bearing assembly, sealing application, and bolting operations. Both depict the human-machine interaction as a core element in future e-axle assembly. The results are evaluated with the help of FMEA analysis, LoA matrix, and a simulation model.

AB  - With the production system shifting to a multi-variety and small-batch production mode, the production process faces more user requirements, changes, and uncertainties. To solve the above problems, it is necessary to obtain the status and trend changes information and provide information support for the optimization of decision-making and dynamic adjustment of the production system. However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems. In addition, as a formal expression of information processing and knowledge learning process in cognitive informatics, the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model can effectively guide the construction of the production process cognitive mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cognitive framework based on OAR model of the human cognitive world for the dynamic cognitive needs of production system. The framework carries out dynamic cognition from the three dimensions of the manufacturing unit, production situation, and production system, and builds the continuous cognitive abilities from the three dimensions of analysis, decision-making, and learning. By integrating intelligent algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, a computable digital twin model is constructed as a carrier to provide the cognitive enabling technologies and capabilities for the production system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated by the developed computational digital twin platform. The computable digital twin platform provides the production system with important cognitive capabilities such as states perception, trend prediction, optimization decision-making, and knowledge learning, to support the dynamic cognition and optimization decision-making of the production system, and lay a technical foundation for adaptive production and cognitive manufacturing.

AB  - Rising product variants and shortened product life cycles require more flexible and universally utilizable production systems and machines. Consequently, it can be expected that the importance of industrial robots in production will continuously increase, due to their suitability to take over the role of a universal production machine. However, robots are not yet able to fulfill this role. Industrial use of robots has so far been limited mainly to simple transport and handling tasks in the context of human-robot collaboration as well as highly repetitive automated tasks in the context of manufacturing and assembly. For universal use, robots must be capable to perform more demanding tasks in manufacturing with higher requirements on mechanical stiffness and accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a mechatronic system to couple two robots to a parallel kinematic system to temporarily increase the mechanical stiffness. The coupled state of the robots allows load sharing, higher process forces and eventually higher precision. The overall goal is to enable robots to perform more demanding manufacturing tasks and thus to be utilized in a wider range of applications. Design requirements, the development approach and optimization methods of the first coupling module prototype will be presented and discussed. The next development steps, a future demonstration system and possible use cases for the coupling module will be shown in the outlook.

AB  - Design for serviceability begins with understanding the customer needs related to availability, reliability, accessibility and visibility, and aims at designing optimized systems where maintenance operations are easy and intuitive in order to reduce the time to repair and service costs. However, service actions are difficult to predict in front of a traditional CAD model. In this context, digital manufacturing tools and virtual simulation technologies can be validly used to create mixed digital environments where service tasks can be simulated in advance to support product design and improve maintenance actions. Furthermore, the use of human monitoring sensors can be used to detect the stressful conditions and to optimize the human tasks. The paper proposes a mixed reality (MR) set-up where operators are digitalized and monitored to analyse both physical and cognitive ergonomics. It is useful to predict design criticalities and improve the global system design. An industrial case study has been developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial to demonstrate how the proposed set-up is used for design for serviceability, on the basis of experimental evidence.

AB  - With the fast growth of intelligent manufacturing industry, developing advanced industrial inspection robots is becoming a research and application hotspot in the fields of both computer vision and robotics. This kind of industrial inspection robots is expected to automatically detect anomalous structures (e.g., defects, damages, rejects, etc.) from the images of the manufactured products. Generally, the existing visual anomaly detection (VAD) methods mainly focus on modeling the complex and high-dimensional distribution of normal data, while neglecting the specific visual properties of abnormal data since their frequency of occurrence is much less than that of the normal data. In this paper, inspired by the human cognition on extracting abstractly visual properties and to distinguish the anomaly patterns from the observed data, we propose a novel cognitive VAD method for industrial inspection robot. Specifically, we introduce a constrained latent space to mimic the cognitive ability of humans, where the abstraction learned from the observed normal and anomaly data are represented. We build our method based on a convolutional generative adversarial network and a denoising auto-encoder, where the adversarial learning mechanism is adopted to establish the boundary between the normal and anomaly data. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real-world dataset where the images are captured for the manufactured products. The comprehensive results comparing with several recent VAD methods show that the proposed method is effective to detect the anomaly images of different categories with a high accuracy.

AB  - Advanced human–robot interaction becomes an essential resource in Industry 4.0. Specifically, the deployment of collaborative robots (cobots) has changed the game in modern smart factories. These robotic agents assist human operators, working with them side-by-side on joint task execution. Because cobots are designed to be more co-workers than tools, fluent interaction between the operators and their robotic counterparts is critical for employees’ task accomplishment and, thus, high performance. The current study investigates the relationships between four perspectives of human–robot interaction fluency (i.e., the human emotions-oriented, the human contribution-oriented, the robot-oriented, and the team-oriented fluency) and operators’ subjective job performance. It also examines the mediating role of work engagement in these relationships. The analysis carried out on 190 male and female cobot operators working on the shop floor showed positive associations between human–robot interaction (HRI) fluency and job performance. The study confirmed the mediating role of work engagement in the relationships of human contribution-oriented fluency and team-oriented fluency with job performance. The obtained results suggest that HRI fluency relates to employee job performance because of the positive affective–cognitive state experienced by the operator when cooperating with a cobot in a coordinated and well-synchronized manner. The findings of the study are discussed within the theoretical framework of cognitive ergonomics, the Job Demand-Control-Support model, the job demands-resources model, and the job design perspective. The article finishes with a conclusion of the results and implications for organizational practice.

AB  - As the pace of innovation in process automation continues to accelerate, the challenges of operationalizing these advances are of increasing interest. Reducing loss incidents in the process industry requires increasingly knowledgeable operators to access multiple sources of current and historic data through industrial informatics. To evaluate the effectiveness of new designs and design features, clear criteria for performance and performance improvements must be developed. The situational design model was developed to assess and develop problem solving skills, the higher cognitive processes necessary for high performing operators to employ in abnormal situations. The situational design model recognizes learner readiness and the disambiguation of “recurrent’ and “non-recurrent” skills. In this paper, the situational design model is demonstrated in a workplace-analogous study to evaluate the effectiveness of Distributed Control System interface adaptation. This type of structured assessment can be used to tie design features more directly to the specific skills of interest and improve the value propositions for new features and designs. The demonstration in this study shows the possibilities for structured assessment and suggests next steps toward aligning business and operations objectives with design evaluation techniques.

AB  - Force output and muscle activity represent the gold standards for measuring physical fatigue. This study explores using ocular metrics for tracking changes in physical fatigue during the completion of a repeated handle push/pull task. Participants completed this task over three trials, and pupil size was recorded by means of a head-mounted eye-tracker. Blink frequency was also measured. Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection.

AB  - Smart manufacturing allows for greater job autonomy and distributed decision-making. This job enrichment poses in turn higher demands on the industrial workforce. In this context, cognitive assistance systems are seen as a means to support human information processing and decision-making. However, the understanding of cognitive processes and actual needs is still somewhat vague. What is needed is a deeper understanding of the nature and scope of needs, to properly identify cases for assistance and select and design appropriate tools. Building on the concept of constraints as applied in Cognitive Work Analysis, we elaborate on this perspective by firstly proposing a general model of human cognition centered around the concept of constraints. A series of qualitative interviews with employees in various sectors is then conducted to test the approach. The results demonstrate that a participative method focusing on needs for assistance can yield relevant results. Based upon the experiences from the study, a taxonomy of assistance for cognitive work is finally proposed. This taxonomy can be embedded in facilitated workshops in order to satisfy identified needs.

AB  - Manufacturing industries are continually challenged to adapt to a competitive environment. Consequently, there is an urgency to opt for automation technologies to upgrade their manufacturing facilities and make them more flexible. Especially this relates to automating manual manufacturing processes, which is often challenging to structure to ensure repetitiveness and generalization to other processes within the facility. Consequently, innovating systematic approaches to identify robotization opportunities is an interesting proposition for manufacturing set-ups that would like to integrate collaborative robots on the shop floor and struggle with the decision steps to follow. In this paper, a framework for supporting robotization effort for manufacturing set-ups is proposed. The methodology consisting of five phases, culminating in the identification of robotization opportunities. A case for manual milling manufacturing processes is demonstrated as a ‘proof-of-concept’. The first step of the proposed approach focuses on task decomposition, in which manual manufacturing tasks are characterized. This is followed by task allocation to a robot and human agent based on intrinsic characteristics of the task to capabilities of the agent. Next, alternative layout configurations for candidate cell layouts are generated. In the final step, a candidate layout is selected and modeled in an agent-based simulation platform, considering factors such as realism, interaction safety between the robot and human agent, and interesting manufacturing metrics such as resource utilization and throughput rate. A final configuration is optimized, which visualizes a collaborative robot performs loading and unloading tasks alongside an operator performing highly cognitive tasks. For safety, zoning of the manufacturing cell is visualized, considering a working area separated by a safety fence.

AB  - The adoption of emerging technologies under the Industry 4.0 paradigm has resulted in an increased quantity of data projected on the human-machine interface (HMI). This complexity is imposed in combination with users’ limited cognitive capabilities to interpret such data quantity. We foresee this limitation fails to address the human-centric approach of the Industry 5.0 paradigm. To overcome this challenge, an automated approach is proposed to enable user-guided ad hoc visualization forms, which ultimately increases users’ situational awareness of supervised industrial processes. In this paper, we present a framework for introducing automated HMI design as a custom feature of standard SCADA-based HMI functionality and showcase an example of how open technology may be used for such purposes, thus opening new avenues for rapid innovation on SCADA HMI. The framework enables integration of the user-initiated additions for loosely coupled visualization components configurable and integrated into the standard HMI runtime layer to meet changing user needs.

AB  - The paper explores the dynamics of labor demand creation and displacement from adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). We combine unique online job postings and patent data to identify AI innovation and AI-skilled labor demand for specific industry sectors and locations. Our analysis shows that AI technologies are increasingly penetrating major industries and disproportionally generating new labor demand for AI-skilled workers in the MSAs in which AI innovation occurs. Our empirical model provides nascent evidence that demand for non-AI labor declines slightly in sectors and MSAs with higher AI skill adoption rates. This decline in labor demand is associated with non-routine cognitive analytical and inter-personal tasks in jobs not previously susceptible to displacement computerization.

AB  - Cognitive Cyber Physical Systems (C-CPS) have gained significant attention from academia and industry during the past few years. One of the main reasons behind this interest is the potential of such technologies to revolutionize human life since they intend to work robustly under complex visual scenes, which environmental conditions may vary, adapting to a comprehensive range of unforeseen changes, and exhibiting prospective behavior like predicting possible events based on cognitive capabilities that are able to sense, analyze, and act based on their analysis results. However, perceiving the environment and translating it into knowledge to be useful for the decision making process, still remains a challenge for real time applications due to the complexity of such process. In this paper, we present a multi-domain knowledge structure based on experience, which can be used as a comprehensive embedded knowledge representation for C-CPS, addressing the representation of visual content issue and facilitating its reuse. The implementation of such representation has been tested in a Cognitive Vision Platform for Hazard Control (CVP-HC) which aims to manage of workers’ exposure to risks in industrial environments, facilitating knowledge engineering processes through a flexible and adaptable implementation.

AB  - Depth cues are crucial to increase user perception and spatial awareness of the remote environment when remotely guiding complex robotic systems. A mixed reality (MR) integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping framework for immersive and intuitive telemanipulation of a complex mobile manipulator is presented. The proposed 3D immersive telerobotic schemes provide the users with depth perception through the merging of multiple 3D/2D views of the remote environment via MR subspace. The mobile manipulator platform consists of a 6°-of-freedom (DOF) industrial manipulator, 3D-printed parallel gripper, and mobile base, which can be controlled by non-skilled operators who are physically separated from the robot working space through a velocity-based imitative motion mapping approach. This work evaluates the impact of depth perception and immersion provided by integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes on teleoperation efficiency and user experience in an MR environment. In particular, the MR enhanced systems maintain spatial awareness and perceptual salience of the remote scene in 3D, facilitating intuitive mixed reality human-robot interaction (MR-HRI). This study compared two MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes against a typical 2D Baseline visual display method through pick-and-place, assembly, and dexterous manufacturing tasks. The MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes of teleoperation reduced overall task completion times by 34% and 17%, compared to the MR-2D Baseline, while minimizing training effort and cognitive workload.

AB  - Most of the operational tasks in the manufacturing process entail numerous physical involvements, despite the introduction of automated equipment. Due to this high physical demand in manufacturing, the need for proactive risk assessment to decrease potential injury cannot be ignored. Physical Demand Analysis (PDA) is a widely used tool recommended to all manufactures by the Canadian Workers’ Compensation Board to document the physical, cognitive, and environmental demands of essential tasks. However, limitations exist in utilizing the content generated in current PDA practice to conduct risk identification and risk assessment, and it has limited functionality for providing modified work to proactively mitigate risk. This paper summarizes the input requirements of risk assessment tools and proposes an improved PDA form with an integrated framework to facilitate the comprehensive and intelligent use of PDA. This paper focuses on three aspects of PDA implementation—risk identification, risk evaluation, and risk mitigation—targeting the development of modified work for the manufacturing industry. The framework is implemented in a window and door manufacturing facility, and a case study of a window glazing station is described in this paper in order to assess awkward body postures. Four main ergonomic risk assessments and identifications are recommended.

AB  - Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), often caused by working in non-ergonomic circumstances, are the most important category of work-related diseases. Different methods exist for examining ergonomics through a variety of postural evaluation techniques (e.g. Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA)), which are mostly performed through manual survey-based observations. Consequently, measuring ergonomics of operators is time-consuming and happens only sporadically, often after problems occur. Furthermore, as an ergonomist must assign a score to the performed activity, the ergonomics evaluation is subjective. These problems can be resolved by continuous and automated ergonomic load monitoring methods that directly provide feedback to operators. In order to monitor the operator without interfering the task at hand, a vision-based ergonomics monitoring system is developed. Here, ergonomic features (e.g. joint angles) are estimated based on multiple video streams, which are used to calculate an objective ergonomic score using a standard ergonomics evaluation technique. Although cognitive operator support systems (i.e. digital work instructions) for manual assembly environments are widely used, they do typically not include ergonomics information. The goal of the methodology presented in this work is to a) formulate or update digital work instructions, b) provide the operator feedback on its ergonomic soundness via work instructions and c) generate ergonomic risk level reports in an automated way based on the outcomes of the vision-based ergonomics evaluator. Making the ergonomic guidelines context-aware ensures that interventions occur at the right time. The methodology is integrated in a framework for context-aware work instructions and is validated via a proof of concept, based on an actual industrial case. Results show that context-awareness enhances user acceptance and ergonomics of the operator.

AB  - Thermal discomfort has a great dynamic impact on cognitive performance and occupants’ well-being during prolonged working. However, few studies have focused on the dynamic changes in cognitive functions and physiological responses under extreme heat stress. This study investigated the cognitive impairment over exposure time at various ambient temperatures, ranging from 21.15℃ WBGT to 38.93℃ WBGT, and its underlying physiological mechanism. 30 well-trained volunteers and 8 occupational operators participated in the experiments, with typical cognitive tests, ECG, and fNIRS measurements. Negative correlations were mainly observed between cognitive test accuracy, ECG RRI, ECG RMSSD, ECG HF/LF, fNIRS ALFF, fNIRS functional connectivity (CORRz, COH, PLV), and exposure time. This indicated that increased physical load, stress, and decreased regulation ability to sudden changes, cognitive resource input, and inter-regional brain cooperation were key factors contributing to cognitive impairments over time. A comprehensive performance index (CPI) was established by the weighted sum of accuracy in cognitive tests and physiological features of ECG and fNIRS. The weights suggested fNIRS ALFF, ECG RRI, and fNIRS functional connectivity could be potential biomarkers for cognitive assessment. A set of linear quantitative CPI curves over exposure time was supplied to calculate the thermal tolerance exposure time at various risk tolerances and ambient temperatures. A power-law relationship (R2>0.997) was observed between the thermal tolerance exposure time and the standardized temperature. This study provides a physiological insight into cognitive impairment under prolonged heat exposure, and quantitative thermal tolerance exposure curves to evaluate safe thermal working duration for both low-risk groups (officers and drivers) and high-risk groups (operators in industry).

AB  - Field assembly of large components for aircraft, ships, trains or big machinery is often done in a rather unstructured environment, with little concern for the individual needs of the involved personnel. Confronted with a shortage of qualified personnel and a generally aging workforce, workstation designers need to put more emphasis on improving ergonomics and allowing for individual adjustments and support for a particular worker. Human factor engineering traditionally uses a “percentile-approach” to work-design, preventing an exact adjustment to the ergonomic needs of particular users. New technological advances provide opportunities for major improvements; novel assistance and information systems allow the accommodation of the needs of an increasingly diverse assembly workforce, while minimizing overall physical and mental stress. Based on a recently developed synopsis of options for individualization of assembly workstations, an example of an application in field assembly is being presented and illustrated by a full-scale demonstrator for the assembly of large scale composite parts for the aerospace industry. The pilot-installation combines a projector-based augmented reality environment for dynamic worker-information with automated operator position tracking and field of vision positioning. Finally, a comprehensive concept, that includes other dimensions of individualization, is presented.

The paper proposes a cognitive robotic system that circumvents this problem by emulating the behaviour of operators through automated, cognitive skills. The approach uses a perception system, handling and skill modules and a skill-based control to automate in an industrial brownfield use case without additional interfaces to the existing control systems to reduce integration effort to a minimum.

AB  - The advent of advanced digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), image processing, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, robotics and cognitive computing that have been embedded in Industry 5.0, is considerably improving the sustainability, resilience, and human-centric performance of industrial organizations. Despite the increasing use of Industry 5.0 technologies in smart product platforming in industrial organizations, a critical issue remains how to assess the providers/suppliers of such technologies in highly competitive markets to fulfil personalized products and services. Following Lancaster's characteristics approach to consumer theory, in this study we contribute to assess digital technologies service providers in the Industry 5.0 era by focusing on both theoretical and empirical evidence inquiring about the convexity of conventional nonparametric frontier estimation methods. To do so, a nonparametric double frontier estimation of the hedonic price characteristics relation is developed from both the buyer's and seller's perspectives. Moreover, a separable directional distance function-based optimization model is developed for the efficiency estimation. Furthermore, a comparable estimation of the convex and nonconvex hedonic price function is proposed. We also explicitly test the impact of convexity in evaluating the efficiency of IoT service providers in the Industry 5.0 context. In this study, we also show that the hypothesis of convexity in assessing the efficiency of IoT service providers is rejected using the Li-test comparing entire densities in the case of the seller's perspective without ratio data. Differences are less pronounced for the buyer's perspective and in the case with ratio data.

AB  - Seeing the innovative character of exoskeletal devices, it appears that there is yet progress to be made in adopting exoskeletons to industry, and to the different users’ characteristics and needs. Their validation is mainly focused on technological aspects and seldom researchers presented methodological approaches including both physical and cognitive impact on operators, synergically with functional issues. This study proposes a multi-faced approach to investigate the impact of passive exoskeletons on functional and ergonomic aspects providing a preliminary experimental validation with an industrial task. The approach assesses the physical comfort, muscular fatigue, cognitive workload, and users’ technological acceptance, to map the overall user experience (UX). Participants were monitored by a mechanomyogram (MMG) and a motion capture (MoCap) system and a UX questionnaire was administered. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of passive exoskeletons regarding the specific task being strictly related to a correct definition of the level of assistance for each user.

AB  - The importance of human and organizational factors in the nuclear industry has been emphasized, and along these lines there have been various improvements to human–system interfaces (HSIs). Operator support systems are one of the key HSIs that can contribute to reduce human errors. The system proposed in this work, called the concealed intelligent assistant (CIA), is designed as an operator support system using artificial intelligence algorithms. The CIA system validates operator actions and notifies operators of human errors to prevent adverse effects on plant integrity. The operation validation system consists of two-step filtering, namely through a procedural compliance check module and a comparison of safety impact evaluation module. Both modules employ a prediction algorithm with deep neural networks, where the former predicts the results of operators’ decision-making, and the latter implements plant parameter prediction strategies. The CIA system minimizes any increase in the cognitive burden on operators because it provides additional information only when a mistake is actually expected to adversely affect the integrity of the power plant.

AB  - Measuring trust is an important element of effective human-robot collaborations (HRCs). It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.

AB  - Precise programming of robots for industrial tasks is inflexible to variations and time-consuming. Teaching a kinematic behavior by demonstration and encoding it with dynamical systems that are robust with respect to perturbations, is proposed in order to address this issue. Given a kinematic behavior encoded by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), this work proposes a passive control scheme for assisting kinesthetic modifications of the learned behavior in task variations. It employs the utilization of penetrable spherical Virtual Fixtures (VFs) around the DMP’s virtual evolution that follows the teacher’s motion. The controller enables the user to haptically ‘inspect’ the spatial properties of the learned behavior in SE(3) and significantly modify it at any required segment, while facilitating the following of already learned segments. A demonstration within the VFs could signify that the kinematic behavior is taught correctly and could lead to autonomous execution, with the DMP generating the newly learned reference commands. The proposed control scheme is theoretically proved to be passive and experimentally validated with a KUKA LWR4+ robot. Results are compared with the case of using a gravity compensated robot agnostic of the previously learned task. It is shown that the time duration of teaching and the user’s cognitive load are reduced.

AB  - In the realm of Digital Twins (DTs), industry experts have emphasised the pivotal concept of the Federation of Twins, envisioning seamless collaboration across sectors driven by shared semantics. In response to this challenge, the Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) integrates the DT framework with formal semantics, specifically ontologies. This paper introduces a comprehensive five-step methodology for CDT development. Furthermore, it becomes possible to incorporate human expertise into the DT ecosystem by adopting an ontological approach. The CDT enhances DT services with advanced reasoning capabilities, leading to a profound semantic enrichment of the data. The presented methodology has been validated using a use case where the CDT is employed to detect malfunctions, significantly reducing manual intervention. This paper advocates for the adoption of CDTs, which represent a harmonious fusion of formal semantics and human expertise, enhancing system efficiency and operational performance.

AB  - The benefits of Industry 4.0 are limited by the large computational requirements of ever-larger digital models of complex production systems. A complementary learning paradigm is thus proposed to cultivate knowledge in a team of machines and humans that represents the key to a high-performance manufacturing system. Two types of knowledge are created using light-weighted neural networks and meta-learning: general knowledge of tasks and specific knowledge on collaboration with humans given few interactions. AI-based teaming strategies are designed to enable machines to leverage human expertise in making decisions using local communications that make intricate sensor systems and expensive computation unnecessary.

AB  - Operators experience complicated physiological and psychological states when exposed to extreme heat stress, which can impair cognitive function and decrease performance significantly, ultimately leading to severe secondary disasters. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a feasible technique to identify their abnormal states to enhance the reliability of human-cybernetics systems. With the advancement of deep learning in physiological modeling, a model for evaluating operators’ performance driven by electrocardiogram (ECG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was proposed, demonstrating high ecological validity. The model fused a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a graph attention network (GAT) backbone to extract discriminative features from ECG time-frequency spectrums and fNIRS prefrontal cortex (PFC) network respectively with deeper neuroscience domain knowledge, and eventually achieved 0.90 AUC. Results supported that handcrafted features extracted by specialized neuroscience methods can alleviate overfitting. Inspired by the small-world nature of the brain network, the fNIRS PFC network was organized as an undirected graph and embedded by GAT. It is proven to perform better in information aggregation and delivery compared to a simple non-linear transformation. The model provides a potential neuroergonomics application to evaluate the human state in vital human-cybernetics systems under industry 5.0 scenarios.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution is a reality and involves digitalisation and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). AI refers to techniques that enable machines or devices to learn, make decisions and optimise processes in a way that simulates human cognitive processes. These capabilities can positively influence machining processes, making them more competitive, more efficient, more sustainable and increasing the quality of the workpieces produced. While in some sectors, such as medicine, these techniques are highly developed, there is not the same level of involvement in industry, especially in the Spanish machining industry. It is necessary to take a step forward in order to be competitive in the face of increasingly high customer demands and reduce the gap between the progress of machining research and actual use in industry. In addition, these technological advances have not been welcomed by workers and citizens as optimistically as would have been desired. This paper will list all the aspects in which AI is a powerful tool for the improvement of machining processes, review the state of industry, especially in Spanish machining companies, and finally examine the social vision of its implementation.

AB  - While being a fundamental driver of competitiveness in agroindustry, technological innovation has also introduced new critical elements related, for example, to the sustainability of the production processes as well as to the safety of workers. In such regard, the advent of the 4th industrial revolution (Agriculture 4.0) based on digitalization, is an unprecedented opportunity of rethinking the role of innovation in a new human-centric perspective. In particular, the establishment of an interconnected work environment and the augmentation of the operator’s physical, sensorial, and cognitive capabilities, are two technologies which can be effectively employed for substantially improving the ergonomics and safety conditions on the workplace. This paper approaches such topic referring to the vibration risk, which is a well-known cause of work-related pathologies, and proposes an original methodology for mapping the risk exposure of the operators to the activities performed. A miniaturized wearable device is employed to collect vibration data, and the signals obtained are segmented in time windows and processed in order to extract the significant features. Finally, a machine learning classifier has been developed to recognize the worker’s activity and to evaluate the related exposure to vibration risks. To validate the methodology proposed, an experimental analysis in real operating conditions has been finally carried out by monitoring the activities performed by a team of workers during harvesting operations. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the methodology proposed.

AB  - Human–Robot Collaboration is a critical component of Industry 4.0, contributing to a transition towards more flexible production systems that are quickly adjustable to changing production requirements. This paper aims to increase the natural collaboration level of a robotic engine assembly station by proposing a cognitive system powered by computer vision and deep learning to interpret implicit communication cues of the operator. The proposed system, which is based on a residual convolutional neural network with 34 layers and a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (ResNet-34 + LSTM), obtains assembly context through action recognition of the tasks performed by the operator. The assembly context was then integrated in a collaborative assembly plan capable of autonomously commanding the robot tasks. The proposed model showed a great performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.65% and a temporal mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.11% for the action recognition of the considered assembly. Moreover, a task-oriented evaluation showed that the proposed cognitive system was able to leverage the performed human action recognition to command the adequate robot actions with near-perfect accuracy. As such, the proposed system was considered as successful at increasing the natural collaboration level of the considered assembly station.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) interconnects a large number of interconnected sensors, actuators, and edge computing devices in the manufacturing systems, where the massive data collected in the manufacturing process has the characteristics of multi-dimensional, heterogeneous, and time series. An effective data representation manner, which can fuse such complex information and enable cognitive manufacturing decision-making from a global perspective, is necessary and challenging. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive manufacturing and applies it in a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) scenario. Based on the digital thread of manufacturing process data, a multi-layer manufacturing knowledge graph is established, including device sensing data, production processing data, and business processing data. With the established knowledge graph, a cognition-driven approach is proposed with a perception-cognition dual system, which achieves perception analysis and cognition decision-making in the resource allocation of the manufacturing process. Finally, responding to the orders of personalized products in a workshop is taken as an illustrative example. The performance of allocating resources of workshop devices under dynamic demand changes shows the advantages of the proposed approach. The proposed manner will lay the foundation for a human-like cognition for processing massive real-time industrial information in CPPS, thus paving a pathway towards the era of cognitive manufacturing.

AB  - The paper discusses about human-systems inclusion as a new way to take into account human factors on systems engineering. This process applies not only principles from human-supported by automation but also those on automation-supported by human to improve autonomy between humans and machines and autonomy between people. The main concern of human-systems integration is the consideration of a low number of future users in the design process or of the feedback of a majority of users in the evaluation process. Human-system inclusion considers that the system has to take into account and adapt to all users whatever their social, economic, physical or cognitive state, or disability. The concept of “human in the loop” or of “human touch” is usually limited to the definition of the role of humans and machines. It does not consider dynamic variability of users and systems abilities, and anticipate the feasible development of autonomous machines by reducing progressively human engagement in the control and supervisory loop. The paper presents both integration and inclusion concepts for Industry 4.0, and then suggests some challenging perspectives for use-centred inclusive manufacturing control systems in terms of opportunities and threats.

AB  - To advance Human-Robot Collaboration in standard assembly, cognitive interaction planning is essential. We propose a framework for interaction planning using Dynamic Field Theory, which is an established framework for modeling embodied cognition. With our framework, an assembly process is divided into phases with cognitive functionality. The robot can understand the human intention and react in a safe and efficient manner to perform the planned task. We illustrate our framework based on an application in an automotive assembly line. The task for the human-robot team is to assemble a chassis deformation element. To evaluate the proposed framework concerning efficiency and subjective acceptance, we conduct a subject study. The study consists of an objective efficiency evaluation and a subjective questionnaire. The result favors the idea of a combination of constant travel speed and obstacle circumvent mechanism for a cognitive Human-Robot Collaboration.

AB  - Nowadays, in order to cover the needs of market for product mass customization, industries have started to move to hybrid production cells, involving both robots and human operators. Research has been done during previous years to promote and improve the collaboration between humans and robots, trying to address topics such as safety, awareness and cognitive support in form of Augmented Reality based instructions. Results of previous research show bottlenecks related to the way of interaction of the operators with such supportive systems though. Direct interaction approach with the use of push buttons or indirect-gesture based interaction, which are most often adopted by the researchers, require operators to constantly occupy their hands performing the relevant button presses or gestures. Moreover, previous approaches are hardware dependent and need a lot of customization to work with different hardware. This work tries to address these bottlenecks proposing the usage of wearable devices enhanced with AI in order to support the interaction of human operators with robots in human-robot collaborative environments in a seamless and non-intrusive way, wrapped around a framework called “Operator Support Module” (OSM). Among others, OSM supports a variety of hardware to easily fit in various industrial scenarios. Two case studies will be presented to demonstrate the approach.

AB  - Recent developments in manufacturing technologies, also known as Industry 4.0, seek to build Smart Factories where supply chains and production lines are equipped with a higher level of automation. However, this significant innovation does not entirely eliminate the need for the presence of human operators; on the contrary, it requires them to collaborate with robots and execute hybrid tasks. Thus, creating safe workspaces for human operators is crucial for the future of factories where humans and robots collaborate closely in common workspaces. The uncertainty of human behavior and, consequently, of the actual execution of workflows, pose significant challenges to the safety of collaborative applications. This paper extends our earlier work, a formal verification methodology to analyze the safety of collaborative robotics applications (Askarpour et al. 2017) [1], with a rich non-deterministic formal model of operator behaviors that captures the hazardous situations resulting from human errors. The model allows safety engineers to refine their designs until all plausible erroneous behaviors are considered and mitigated. The solidity of the proposed approach is evaluated on a pair of real-life case studies.

AB  - Currently machine operator interface is mainly focused on providing the operator with easy control over the production processes and easy access to related information. However, myriad of recent technological advances in variety of fields including AI, raise the question of what could be added to the operator-machine interaction capabilities and how. This article explores the possibilities to harness new capabilities in cognitive and behavioral knowledge as well as AI and “Industry 4.0” literature in order to outline the architectural framework and capabilities of future work-station‒operator interaction as a principal component of the human‒machine interaction in the “Industry 4.0” era. The proposed system is named “Workstation‒Operator Interaction 4.0” (WOI 4.0). The equipment’s capabilities allows an adaptive ongoing interaction that aims to improve operator performance, safety, well-being, and satisfaction, as well as production measures. The paper describes the main elements of the proposed WOI 4.0 architecture, and illustrates a case of smart machine‒operator interactions. The contributions, limitations, and implications of the proposed WOI 4.0 system in the “Industry 4.0” arena are discussed, and future research directions are presented.

AB  - In complex human-computer interactions, issues such as task failures, system malfunctions, and frequent accidents caused by user errors are common. Therefore, it is necessary to study complex system interactions to enhance overall efficiency. This study focuses on the task interface of a digital twin system for computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools and examines the relationship between the user mental model and interface design elements. Key mental information is obtained through questionnaires and interviews, forming the basis for establishing a user mental model. High-frequency information words are extracted, experimental samples are designed, and importance rating surveys are conducted. Quantitative analysis methods, including factor analysis and weight calculation, are utilized to analyze the needs of target users. Consequently, a user demand hierarchy model is constructed. This approach aims to effectively reduce user errors in the human-computer interaction process within complex systems and enhance cognitive efficiency.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of season on cognitive function and psycho-physiological responses during a 14-day swing in mine-service workers. Cognitive function, thermal sensation and comfort, rating of perceived exertion, fatigue, hydration, core temperature and heart rate were assessed throughout a shift, on three separate days over a swing. Working memory and processing efficiency did not differ between seasons (p > 0.05), however counting and recall latencies improved throughout the swing (p < 0.05). Participants reported greater fatigue post-shift compared to pre-shift (p < 0.05). Thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and hydration were significantly elevated in summer compared to winter (p < 0.05). Specifically, workers were significantly/minimally dehydrated in summer/winter (urinary specific gravity = 1.025 ± 0.007/1.018 ± 0.007). Although cognitive function and thermal strain were not impaired in summer compared to winter, it is essential to reinforce worker's knowledge regarding hydration requirements. Additional education and/or incorporating scheduled rest breaks for hydration should be considered to ensure the health and safety of mine workers.

AB  - The Exoskeleton represents a promising technology aiming to improve physical and organizational ergonomics in manufacturing reducing the physical fatigue, thus enhancing cognitive ergonomics. The foundations of digital transformation of human-centred workplaces with integrated Exoskeletons have been well researched by the group, coping currently with the challenge of optimizing the ergonomics simulation parameters and embedding the Exoskeleton controller in simulation systems. A methodology of capturing in real-time workers’ physiological status wearing active and passive Exoskeletons, data interpretation and aggregation towards developing a hybrid human/Exoskeleton Digital Model represents the current work of the group.

AB  - Process Industry is one of the leading sectors of the world economy, characterized however by intense environmental impact, and very high-energy consumption. Despite a traditional low innovation pace in PI, in the recent years a strong push at worldwide level towards the dual objective of improving the efficiency of plants and the quality of products, significantly reducing the consumption of electricity and CO2 emissions has taken momentum. Digital Technologies (namely Smart Embedded Systems, IoT, Data, AI and Edge-to-Cloud Technologies) are enabling drivers for a Twin Digital-Green Transition, as well as foundations for human centric, safe, comfortable and inclusive workplaces. Currently, digital sensors in plants produce a large amount of data, which in most cases constitutes just a potential and not a real value for Process Industry, often locked-in in close proprietary systems and seldomly exploited. Digital technologies, with process modelling-simulation via digital twins, can build a bridge between the physical and the virtual worlds, bringing innovation with great efficiency and drastic reduction of waste. In accordance with the guidelines of Industrie 4.0 this work proposes a modular and scalable Reference Architecture, based on open source software, which can be implemented both in brownfield and greenfield scenarios. The ability to distribute processing between the edge, where the data have been created, and the cloud, where the greatest computational resources are available, facilitates the development of integrated digital solutions with cognitive capabilities. The reference architecture is being validated in the three pilot plants, paving the way to the development of integrated planning solutions, with scheduling and control of the plants, optimizing the efficiency and reliability of the supply chain, and balancing energy efficiency.

AB  - As the Industry 5.0 paradigm evolves to the forefront of research directions, a dissonance emerges between smart and sustainable elements. This stems from the misbalance of priorities appointed during the engineering design process. Selection of technology driven features, such as collaborative robots and IoT devices are often implemented at the expense of other criteria such as environmental sustainability. This observation is investigated on a workstation designed for human-robot collaboration (HRC), but with limited regard to the energy consumption and carbon footprint incurred during its life cycle. Consequently, this research work attempts to understand the consequences of design decisions for HRC safety (physical and cognitive) on environmental sustainability. The impacts of various HRC workstation scenarios (including various safety features and components) are evaluated using environmental metrics while Design for Environmental Sustainability (DfES) is adopted to close the rift between safety and sustainability. This work uses material substitution and dematerialisation to compensate for the negative impacts resulting from smart HRC features, achieving a reduction of 10 % in both energy consumption and carbon footprint when compared to the same workstation not having undergone the DfES exercise. This paves the way for academia and industrial designers seeking to strike a balance between human-centric and environmentally sustainable HRC.

AB  - In recent years, businesses have strived to align their manufacturing goods with the unique needs and preferences of their customers. However, the mass customization paradigm introduces challenges mostly associated to the manipulation of small product batches and knowledge management. This paper proposes a framework for intelligent reconfigurable manufacturing systems, that leverages robotic automation supported by a collaborative dual-arm manipulator, cognitive mechatronic devices, and machine-learning algorithms. In more detail, pioneer end-effectors and machinery provide the capacity of grasping and handling a variety of products without time-consuming hardware modifications. The backbone of this manipulation scheme is a set of machine learning tools for: a) the planning and synchronization of handling agents, b) identification and localization of workpieces, c) the generation of optimal packaging configurations based on customer orders and identified workpieces, and d) the allocation of the respective handling operations to robots, operators, and machinery. The proposed framework is evaluated through its implementation on a use case deriving from the metal industry. The particularities of this use case, as expressed in product variety, workpiece complexity, customer orders and intralogistics, provide a fertile ground for the validation of the discussed technologies.

AB  - In modern plants with high levels of automation, acquiring an adequate mental model of the process has become a challenge for operators. Studies indicate that sub-optimal decisions occur when there is a mismatch between the demands of the process and the human's capability. This mismatch leads to high cognitive workload in human operators, often a precursor for poor performance. Recently, researchers in various safety critical domains (aviation, driving, marine, NPP, etc.) have started to explore the use of physiological measurements from humans to understand their cognitive workload and its effect. In this work, we evaluate the potential of EEG to measure cognitive workload of human operators in chemical process control room. We propose a single dry electrode EEG based methodology for identifying the similarities and mismatch between the operators’ mental model of the process and the actual process behaviour during abnormal situations. Our results reveal that SƟ(ω), the power spectral density of theta (ɵ) waves (frequency range 4–7 Hz) in the EEG signal has the potential to identify such mismatches. Results indicate that SƟ(ω) is positively correlated with workload and hence can be used for assessing the cognitive workload of operators in process industries.

AB  - It is well known that exposure to light at the right time of the day is important to synchronise our circadian rhythm and enhance cognitive functioning. There is, however, a lack of field studies investigating which lighting characteristics are necessary to improve sleep and cognitive functioning. A controlled field study with 80 shift workers was set up, in which the impact of an integrative lighting (IL) scenario was investigated during the morning shift. Two groups were compared: a control group (no change in lighting settings) and a IL-group (exposed to a melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance of 192 lux, i.e., bright light with a high fraction of short-wavelengths). Pre-post measurement of visual comfort, cognitive functioning (D2 task, go-nogo reaction time task) and sleep (MotionWatch8) were performed. The IL-settings ameliorated sleep efficiency and sleep latency during morning shift and enhanced alertness (not inhibition) compared to standard lighting conditions. Changing lighting settings in an industrial setting should be considered as it seems worthwhile for employees’ sleep and cognitive performance.

AB  - This paper proposes a cognitive digital twin framework for smart manufacturing, and especially for human-robot-collaboration cases. The proposed framework comprises three layers (field, edge, and cloud layers) based on the 5G communication network. In the field layer, the physical twin’s data from the physical machine and human operators are transmitted through the edge layer and then to the cloud layer to virtualize the digital twin. The cloud layer generates inference model generation by deep learning training and updates the inference model in the edge layer to make the field’s machine smart. Especially, human operators’ models are built based on the multimodal fusion in the cloud layer for cognitive function. Also, edge-cloud collaborative computing is presented to implement the proposed framework. Finally, the study is validated with a human-robot-collaboration case involving 5G edge computing.

AB  - Hazardous industrial operations are highly stochastic, still human-dependent, and risky. Operators working in such an environment must understand the complex interrelation between several factors contributing to safe and effective operations. Therefore, being able to predict the effects of their actions on provoking or mitigating possible accidents is crucial. This study aims to utilize fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) to model the expert’s reasoning about occupational health and safety (OHS) in confined space. This knowledge is used by operators to build their mental models. The developed FCM displays all the possible incidents of a confined space and links these incidents with all their causing and preventing factors. This approach may facilitate the development of simulation-based training solutions and allow operators to act proactively during the operation.

AB  - The low volume-high variety strategy of the companies increases the need for well-trained operators. The operators have a much larger cognitive load than before and their expertise must be kept up to date at any time. To solve this problem, efficient training programs must be maintained. A physical replica of the real setting to perform an assembly training is often a too large investment. Therefore, a virtual replica is introduced in many cases. This paper gives an overview of reported experiments on virtual training for manual assembly. All experiments are classified based on some key elements: the evaluation method, the interaction interface and product complexity. An evaluation framework is proposed to compare different virtual training systems. This benchmark will be used in future research to determine the industrial usability of virtual training approaches for manual assembly in mixed-model environments.

AB  - Empowered by the advanced cognitive computing, industrial Internet-of-Things, and data analytics techniques, today’s smart manufacturing systems are ever-increasingly equipped with cognitive capabilities, towards an emerging Self-X cognitive manufacturing network with higher level of automation. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the readiness of ‘Self-X’ levels (e.g., self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adjust/adaptive/healing) is still in the infant stage. To pave its way, this work stepwise introduces an industrial knowledge graph (IKG)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for achieving the Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. Firstly, an IKG should be formulated based on the extracted empirical knowledge and recognized patterns in the manufacturing process, by exploiting the massive human-generated and machine-sensed multimodal data. Then, a proposed graph neural network-based embedding algorithm can be performed based on a comprehensive understanding of the established IKG, to achieve semantic-based self-configurable solution searching and task decomposition. Moreover, a MARL-enabled decentralized system is presented to self-optimize the manufacturing process, and to further complement the IKG towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. An illustrative example of multi-robot reaching task is conducted lastly to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. As an explorative study, limitations and future perspectives are also highlighted to attract more open discussions and in-depth research for ever smarter manufacturing.

This adaptation poses an additional challenge when multiple custom workpieces are enmeshed in complex processes. This paper presents a novel framework, Cognitive Engine Process Controller (CEPC), which realizes a human-centric manufacturing system by augmenting the human in workflow selection and providing the flexibility in using alternative methods in the workflow. The CEPC streamlines overwhelming information for the human to select the next manufacturing steps via dynamic web ontology language (OWL) ontologies, a conflict checker, and a learner. The CEPC can monitor the completion of each step, determine the effect of a failed step, and suggest a set of suitable steps. Simulation results showed the potential of the CEPC via demonstrations. The CEPC has also been compared with an existing cognitive engine framework for workflow planning.

AB  - In the context of Industry 4.0, cognitive ergonomics is crucial for improving the working conditions and the psychosocial well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart machines, as well as for the enhancement of production performances. Nevertheless, this topic is often neglected or ignored when implementing human-robot interaction in industrial settings. Starting from the results obtained from previous studies, this work proposes a structured process to develop and preliminarily validate a set of guidelines to support non-experts in human factors at the early stages of the design of human-centered and collaborative applications. A systematic analysis of the scientific literature has been performed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to identify relevant results on the topic. Successively, the guidelines have been developed starting from such an analysis by considering the target group and the final aim of the work. This phase involved the analysis, classification, summary, and abstraction of relevant statements and results from the selected articles, as well as the update of the previous set of guidelines. The guidelines have been preliminarily validated by an external team of researchers currently doing research in the field. Qualitative feedback on understandability and relevance has been collected to improve the guidelines before further investigations.

AB  - Today in the increasingly competitive market, consumers prefer to have a great variety of products to choose from; this preference is often coupled with demands for a relatively smaller lot size, shorter lead time, higher quality and lower cost. Consequently, manufacturing companies are being forced to consistently increase flexibility and responsiveness of their production systems in order to accommodate changes of the fluctuating market. Among various forms of production systems, human-centred manufacturing systems can offer such a capability in dealing with product variations and production volumes as human workers can always adapt themselves to perform multiple tasks after a learning process. However, human performance can also be unpredictable and it may alter due to varying psychological and physiological states, which are often overlooked by researchers when designing, implementing or evaluating a manufacturing system. This paper presents a study aiming to address these issues by exploring human factors and their interactions that may affect human performance on human-centred assembly systems. The study was carried out based on a literature review and an industrial survey. Critical system performance indicators, which are affected by human factors, were evaluated and the most significant human factors were identified using the fuzzy extent analysis method. The research findings show that experience is the most significant human factor that affects individual human performance, compared to age and general cognitive abilities in human-centred assembly. By contrast, both human reaction time and job satisfaction have the least effect on human performance. The significance of ageing on human performance was also studied and it was concluded that average assembly time of human workers rises by average 1% per year after the age of 38 years old.

AB  - In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have transcended their typical rapid prototyping role and become viable methods to directly manufacture end products in a highly versatile manner. Due to its low cost and relative ease of use, fused deposition modeling (FDM) has become the most universally applied AM technology. Nonetheless, skilled operators are often still required to perform maintenance, diagnostic, and repair tasks. Such operators need to be adequately trained. Here, Augmented reality (AR) technology could be used to automate this training and help to promptly provide new operators with the necessary skills to perform specific tasks as required. However, the most effective approach to designing such AR-based assistance systems has not yet been fully explored. Consequently, we address this need by reporting on how to design such guiding systems using well-known design engineering methodologies. We then further assess the applicability of our approach through a user study with domain experts. In addition, we complete our assessment with heuristical verification of system expressiveness to reason about the influence of cognitively important components of the AR interface on the operators.

AB  - Human-robot interaction is a key enabling technology of Industry 4.0 and the prospected pervasiveness of robotics in industrial environments will be not possible without enabling them to safety interact with humans. Such a fact imposes a relevant constraints because the limits imposed by the actual technical deliverables entail strong requirements in the operational velocity of robots when sharing their workspace with humans. In this paper, we address the theoretical limits of velocity under the light of current state-of-the-art trajectory planning and normative requirements. The main goal is to find a methodology to plan safe trajectories without neglecting cognitive ergonomics and production efficiency aspects. We start by considering the set of trajectories which are optimal with respect to a cognitive criteria and give a suitable parametrization to it. Then we are able to formulate the safety requirements in terms of constraints in an optimization problem. Finally, experimental results are provided. This allow the identification of the preferable sets of possible motions which satisfy the operator psychological wellbeing and the assembly process performance by complying the safety requirements in terms of mechanical risk prevention.

AB  - This paper introduces the Manufacturing-Uber concept for dynamic assignment of operators in the Connected Factory. In traditional non-IoT machining environments it is common to assign an operator to a (small) number of machines, clustered in close proximity within a cell. In contrast to “fixed” assignment within a cell, the Manufacturing-Uber approach leverages the connectivity of the IoT environment to allow on-demand “floating” operator assignment across cells. An intelligent assignment engine determines and assigns the operator to achieve best system performance. Results show that Manufacturing-Uber outperforms fixed assignment with respect to reduction in required operators, increased machine up-time and more parts completed.

AB  - This paper refers to the physical, sensing, and cognitive interaction in the Industry 4.0 concept and presents Human Cyber-Physical Production Systems in a laboratory environment. The Industry 4.0 defines new demands for productivity and effectiveness in production, which inevitably influences operators as well. A traditional operator is being transformed to the Operator 4.0. In this paper, we describe evolving roles of the operators in the factories. There are many ways to enhance the operator’s physical, sensing, and cognitive capabilities. Given case studies are based on the defined Operator 4.0 typology. Types can be used individually or in combination to put humans into the center of technological revolution. We also describe our laboratory case studies developed during the previous research. We have focused on legacy systems, healthcare monitoring platform, the concept of predictive maintenance, and machine to people interaction system based on operator position. These case studies illustrate the possible applications of smart and cognitive solutions for the Operator 4.0. The obtained results are then evaluated by a set of criteria to compare legacy systems with our laboratory case studies based on the Operator 4.0 concept.

AB  - Due to an increasing demand for individualized products and the resulting high variability in manufacturing processes, flexibility and cognitive skills of human workers are highly important for manual assembly processes. Nowadays, novice workers are often trained by colleagues or foremen in addition to and alongside their main work. Since time is usually scarce and the procedure can be highly variable, one solution for the companies can be the introduction of digital assistance systems. Hence, the focus of this contribution is the initial learning procedure of the assembly of a new and complex product. Therefore, a user study was conducted in close cooperation with an industrial partner to compare the traditional way of training to the self-paced learning with a digital assistance system. During the execution of the user study, objective data was recorded to allow precise measurements of the individual learning progress. Furthermore, the subjective learning experience was assessed using a customized questionnaire and a standardized task load metric. The evaluation of the study results suggests that learning autonomously with a digital assistance system leads to similar performance curves as learning the process through a personal explanation.

AB  - Higher complexity and increased global competition emphasises the need of flexibility for organisations in manufacturing. To achieve this puts challenges on todays manufacturing systems and the human operators doing the tasks. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as cognitive automation and to increase information sharing among the operators has been discussed as important tools to meet those challenges. A highly customized mobile application was developed at a large Swedish manufacturing company. This application has been introduced on smartphone devices to the operators in a manufacturing process. This paper presents empirical findings from the first year of this test. The study provides an example where information and communication technology have enabled manufacturing operators to perform new work tasks through increased trust and knowledge.

AB  - Easy-to-use collaborative robotics solutions, where human workers and robots share their skills, are entering the market, thus becoming the new frontier in industrial robotics. They allow to combine the advantages of robots, which enjoy high levels of accuracy, speed and repeatability, with the flexibility and cognitive skills of human workers. However, to achieve an efficient human–robot collaboration, several challenges need to be tackled. First, a safe interaction must be guaranteed to prevent harming humans having a direct contact with the moving robot. Additionally, to take full advantage of human skills, it is important that intuitive user interfaces are properly designed, so that human operators can easily program and interact with the robot. In this survey paper, an extensive review on human–robot collaboration in industrial environment is provided, with specific focus on issues related to physical and cognitive interaction. The commercially available solutions are also presented and the main industrial applications where collaborative robotic is advantageous are discussed, highlighting how collaborative solutions are intended to improve the efficiency of the system and which the open issue are.
