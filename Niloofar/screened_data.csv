A vision-enabled fatigue-sensitive human digital twin towards human-centric human-robot collaboration,"Within a Human-centric Human-Robot Collaboration (HHRC) system, monitoring, assessing, and optimizing for an operator's well-being is essential to creating an efficient and comfortable working environment. Currently, monitoring systems are used for independent assessment of human factors. However, the rise of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) has provided the framework for synchronizing multiple operator well-being assessments to create a comprehensive understanding of the operator's performance and health. Within manufacturing, an operator's dynamic well-being can be attributed to their physical and cognitive fatigue across the assembly process. As such, we apply non-invasive video understanding techniques to extract relevant assembly process information for automatic physical fatigue assessment. Our novelty involves a video-based fatigue estimation method, in which the boundary-aware dual-stream MS-TCN combined with an LSTM is proposed to detect the operation type, operation repetitions, and the target arm performing each task in an assembly process video. The detected results are then input into our physical fatigue profile to automatically assess the operator's localized physical fatigue impact. The assembly process of a real-world bookshelf is recorded and tested against, with our algorithm results showing superiority in operation segmentation and target arm detection as opposed to other recent action segmentation models. In addition, we integrate a cognitive fatigue assessment tool that captures operator physiological signals in real-time for body response detection caused by stress. This provides a more robust HDT of the operator for an HHRC system. © 2024 The Authors",Ergonomics; Fatigue assessment; Human digital twin; Human-centric manufacturing; Human-robot collaboration; Vision-based operation segmentation,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2024,Journal,Chand S.; Zheng H.; Lu Y.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.10.002
A Dualistic Perspective of Opportunity and Risk: The Impact of Head-Mounted Augmented Reality on Construction Onsite Hazard Identification of Workers,"Head-mounted augmented reality (HMD AR) technology in construction has shown promise in enhancing operational efficiency. Concurrently, the critical role of hazard identification (HI) in ensuring worker safety is well-documented. Despite this, studies delving into HMD AR's impact on HI, especially across varying task complexities, are limited. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the influence of HMD AR on construction workers' HI in diverse task environments. The research engaged 48 participants in an experiment to evaluate their hazard situation awareness (HSA), cognitive load (CL), and task performance (TP). These were assessed using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), the Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and measures of task accuracy. Findings indicated that environmental conditions significantly modulate HMD AR's effect on HI. In simple and safe scenes, HMD AR has a negligible impact on HI and might enhance hazard detection capabilities. However, in complex and hazardous situations with intense workloads, HMD AR can impair HI, potentially increasing safety risks. In other words, whether HMD AR brings opportunities or risks for HI depends on the different environmental conditions. This research contributes to the nascent field of cognitive safety in HMD AR, specifically regarding HI in construction, augmenting the current understanding and laying a theoretical groundwork for HMD AR's future safety applications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The insights gained inform the prudent implementation, training, and interface design of HMD AR on construction sites. In the context of HMD AR's rapid evolution, this study underscores the importance of critically assessing safety implications to guide the responsible utilization of new technologies. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Cognitive behavior and performance; Cognitive load (CL); Construction hazard identification; Head-mounted display augmented reality; Situational awareness,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,2024,Journal,Liu J.; Yan X.; Gao W.,10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-14684
Putting workers’ safety front and center: Employee-organization exchange and employee safety performance,"Introduction: The global occupational accident situation remains severe. As enhancing employee safety performance constitutes a crucial part of accident prevention and safety management, the study aims to examine, from an employment relationship perspective, the cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms through which employee-organization exchange (EOX), as a social exchange type of employment relationship, can affect employee safety performance. Method: Data were collected from 672 subordinates and their immediate 100 supervisors in three large manufacturing firms in Guangdong province, China. Results: The results shows that: (1) EOX has a positive effect on employees’ safety risk perception, psychological ownership of safety promotion, and safety communication; (2) safety risk perception, psychological ownership of safety promotion and safety communication (as cognitive, motivational and behavioral mechanisms) mediate the relationship between EOX and safety performance (both safety compliance and safety participation); and (3) management commitment to safety moderates the direct effect of EOX on safety risk perception, psychological ownership of safety promotion, and safety communication, and its indirect effect on two forms of safety performance via the three mediating mechanisms. The moderating effect and moderated indirect effect are stronger when management commits more to safety. The study contributes to the employee safety literature. Practical Applications: Employers should establish a long-term oriented social exchange relationship with their employees for effective safety management. © 2024 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd",Employee-organization exchange; Management commitment to safety; Psychological ownership of safety promotion; Safety communication; Safety performance; Safety risk perception,Journal of Safety Research,2024,Journal,Kuang H.-X.; Pan W.; Sun L.-Y.,10.1016/j.jsr.2024.08.007
Research on the Human–Robot Collaborative Disassembly Line Balancing of Spent Lithium Batteries with a Human Factor Load,"The disassembly of spent lithium batteries is a prerequisite for efficient product recycling, the first link in remanufacturing, and its operational form has gradually changed from traditional manual disassembly to robot-assisted human–robot cooperative disassembly. Robots exhibit robust load-bearing capacity and perform stable repetitive tasks, while humans possess subjective experiences and tacit knowledge. It makes the disassembly activity more adaptable and ergonomic. However, existing human–robot collaborative disassembly studies have neglected to account for time-varying human conditions, such as safety, cognitive behavior, workload, and human pose shifts. Firstly, in order to overcome the limitations of existing research, we propose a model for balancing human–robot collaborative disassembly lines that take into consideration the load factor related to human involvement. This entails the development of a multi-objective mathematical model aimed at minimizing both the cycle time of the disassembly line and its associated costs while also aiming to reduce the integrated smoothing exponent. Secondly, we propose a modified multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines chaos theory and the global cooperation mechanism to improve the performance of the algorithm. We add Gaussian mutation and crowding distance to efficiently solve the discrete optimization problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and sensitivity of the improved multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm by solving and analyzing an example of Mercedes battery pack disassembly. © 2024 by the authors.",disassembly; green manufacturing; human-factor load; human–robot collaborative,Batteries,2024,Journal,Jiao J.; Feng G.; Yuan G.,10.3390/batteries10060196
Multilinear principal component analysis-based tensor decomposition for fabric weave pattern recognition from high-dimensional streaming data,"Modern textile industry integrates video sensors with automated fabric reeling systems for real-time fabric weave pattern inspection. This automation system lessens the human-vision-based cognitive load and improves fabric weave pattern inspection work. However, this automation system poses a unique challenge, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional streaming data from highly precision digital microscope cameras. The complexity arises from the continuous acquisition and management of such high-dimensional streaming video data. Considering the challenges posed by dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional data, this study employs multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA)-based tensor decomposition, a statistical technique designed to effectively reduce high-dimensional datasets into low-dimensional features. This paper proposes an innovative method for fabric weave pattern recognition (FWPR) by leveraging MPCA-based tensor decomposition to extract low-dimensional features from the high-dimensional fabric’s surface texture descriptor tensor (STDT). This proposed method replicates fabric pattern monitoring in automated fabric reeling systems by integrating a digital microscope camera to capture high-dimensional streaming video data from fabric surface texture features. Subsequently high-dimensional video data is converted into sequential image frames representing different fabric weave patterns. These image frames are processed with local binary pattern (LBP) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) methods to aggregate fabric’s surface pattern features and construct the high-dimensional STDT. This STDT is subsequently decomposed into low-dimensional features by leveraging MPCA, resulting in an impressive 99.99% reduction in dimension. A supervised machine learning method utilizes the extracted low-dimensional features to enable FWPR, demonstrating superiority of the proposed method over the benchmark methods in evaluation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",Computer vision; Fabric pattern recognition; Feature extraction; Industrial automation; Linear binarization pattern; Tensor decomposition,Pattern Analysis and Applications,2024,Journal,Al Mamun A.; Islam M.I.; Shohag M.A.S.; Al-Kouz W.; Noor K.M.A.,10.1007/s10044-024-01318-4
Performance-Aware Trust Modeling within a Human-Multi-Robot Collaboration Setting,"In this study, a novel time-driven mathematical model for trust is developed considering human-multi-robot performance for a Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) framework. For this purpose, a model is developed to quantify human performance considering the effects of physical and cognitive constraints and factors such as muscle fatigue and recovery, muscle isometric force, human (cognitive and physical) workload, workloads due to the robots' mistakes, and task complexity. The performance of multi-robot in the HRC setting is modeled based upon the rate of task assignment and completion as well as the mistake probabilities of the individual robots. The human trust in HRC setting with single and multiple robots is modeled over different operation regions, namely unpredictable region, predictable region, dependable region, and faithful region. The relative performance difference between the human operator and the robot is used to analyze the effect on the human operator's trust in robots' operation. The developed model is simulated for a manufacturing workspace scenario considering different task complexities and involving multiple robots to complete shared tasks. The simulation results indicate that for a constant multi-robot performance in operation, the human operator's trust in robots' operation improves whenever the comparative performance of the robots improves with respect to the human operator performance. The impact of robot hypothetical learning capabilities on human trust in the same HRC setting is also analyzed. The results confirm that a hypothetical learning capability allows robots to reduce human workloads, which improves human performance. The simulation result analysis confirms that the human operator's trust in the multi-robot operation increases faster with the improvement of the multi-robot performance when the robots have a hypothetical learning capability. An empirical study was conducted involving a human operator and two collaborator robots with two different performance levels in a software-based HRC setting. The experimental results closely followed the pattern of the developed mathematical models when capturing human trust and performance in terms of human-multi-robot collaboration. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Decoding the silent language: A framework for advanced visual emotion recognition to enhance worker well-being on IIoT-enabled manufacturing,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), pivotal in the Industry 4.0 revolution, has transformed manufacturing, particularly assembly lines, by enabling real-time process monitoring and data analysis to enhance productivity. Yet, its potential impact on worker well-being has been less explored. As the National Association of Manufacturers anticipates an opening of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, the necessity for frameworks that not only understand but also improve employee well-being becomes apparent. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive visual emotion recognition framework that incorporates facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotional body posture recognition (EBPR) to assess workers’ psychological states. This initiative aims to mitigate human errors and accidents linked to stress or high cognitive load, thereby enhancing the manufacturing environment. Strategies such as optimized break time planning, line balancing, procedure modifications, and improved training are proposed to ensure both employee well-being and stakeholder benefits. This framework indirectly supports the industry's efforts to address the looming challenge of unfilled jobs by fostering a supportive work environment that enhances job satisfaction, potentially making positions more appealing and retaining valuable talent. By bridging the gap between technological advancements and human-centric considerations, our approach underscores the significance of integrating IIoT solutions with employee welfare initiatives to address both productivity and workforce sustainability challenges. © 2024 The Author(s)",Assembly line; Emotion recognition; Employee well-being; Facial expression; IIoT; Posture,Manufacturing Letters,2024,Journal,Rezaei N.; Vaezi S.A.; Camelio J.A.,10.1016/j.mfglet.2024.09.162
Aging in Industry 5.0: Enhancing Human-Robot Synergy in Manufacturing and Logistics,"This paper presents a systematic literature review exploring the impact of human-robot (HR) systems on older workers in manufacturing and logistics industries, drawing insights into how these systems can be optimally designed to address human factors in four key areas-perceptual, physical, cognitive, and psychosocial-aligning with the goals of Industry 5.0. By analyzing 19 articles selected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, we identified both the benefits and challenges that HR systems pose to the aging workforce. We conclude that to achieve Industry 5.0 goals, HR systems must be designed to balance automation with human skills, promoting adaptability and inclusivity tailored to the diverse responses of older workers.

The relation between cognitive and organizational factors in the production environment,"The adoption of I4.0's technologies in the work cells accompanied by societal changes calls for new approaches to manage the current production systems. Nevertheless, the current models simulating the behavior of the work cells limit the representation of the operators to the average human, without regard for their individual characteristics, cognitive abilities or psychosocial state. The aim of this paper is to achieve two objectives: firstly, the authors propose a conceptual model for enhancing a human-centered production environment. Secondly, the paper summarizes how the literature characterizes the different dimensions of relations between cognitive and organizational factors. By integrating the collaborative, psychological, social, cognitive, organizational and system performance dimensions, the proposed model focuses on the relationships between these dimensions. Thus, operational models should be closer to the real production environment to improve the design choices of the manufacturing systems.

A natural bare-hand interface-enabled interactive AR assembly guidance,"Augmented reality (AR) can benefit manual assembly operations by superimposing intuitive visual guidance on the workbench directly, alleviating the mental load to determine the next operation while improving assembly performance. Where the bare-hand gesture interface is considered a promising manner to manipulate the virtual assembly model, nevertheless, it usually suffers from unreliable recognition results and poor adaptability due to the unfamiliarity with gesture libraries in actual AR assembly tasks. In this paper, we try to establish a robust and easy-to-use natural bare-hand interactive AR assembly system, enabling the operator to interact against the ongoing virtual assembly models intuitively and resulting in a human-centric AR assembly performance. Firstly, a normalized feature information extraction for real-time bare-hand gestures is presented, which can establish a robust gesture model expression when encountering different sensing distances and varying operators. Followed by the definition of some typical bare-hand interaction functions related to manual assembly operations, and thus reliable interactions between hand gestures and virtual components are available. Then, a bare-hand-enabled interactive AR assembly system is established, where operators can explore and manipulate a large amount of assembly-related information with the help of real-time bare-hand interaction. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed bare-hand interactive AR assembly system, and results demonstrate that it can alleviate the cognitive load for the operators while providing a human-centric assembly performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",Augmented reality; Bare-hand interaction; Human-centric manufacturing; Smart assembly,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2024,Journal,Fang W.; Teng Z.; Zhang Q.; Wu Z.,10.1007/s00170-024-13922-z
Development and application of a quantitative index for predicting unsafe behavior of shop floor workers integrating cognitive failure reports and best worst method,"The reliability of shop floor workers, who are often as the final level of a socio-technical system, has been identified as a crucial factor in complex systems. This study aimed to develop and apply a quantitative and practical method to help safety practitioners manage unsafe behavior in industrial systems. This study is a descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional research conducted in an Iranian manufacturing company. A questionnaire containing six primary scales of unsafe behavior was used to evaluate the participants' scores for unsafe behavior. Since the impact of each of the six scales on the occurrence of unsafe behavior varied, the scales were weighted using the best–worst method (BWM). Finally, to quantify the workers' unsafe behavior, the total unsafe behavior index (USBITotal) score was calculated. The mean scores for routine violations (RVs) and exceptional violations (EVs) were 10.68 and 5.09, respectively, indicating the highest and lowest values. The present study introduces an innovative proactive tool to provide safety practitioners with a practical method for predicting cognitive unsafe behavior of shop floor workers. This tool is cost-effective, accessible, and utilizes quantitative measures. The developed method seems to be a suitable tool for measuring the frequency of slips, lapses, and mistakes, as well as various types of violations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Human error; Industrial settings; Unsafe behavior; Violations,Soft Computing,2024,Journal,Shakerian M.; Choobineh A.; Jahangiri M.; Alimohammadlou M.; Hasanzadeh J.; Nami M.,10.1007/s00500-024-09750-8
Personalizing Human–Robot Workplace Parameters in Human-Centered Manufacturing,"This study investigates the relationship between collaborative robot (CR) parameters and worker utilization and system performance in human–robot collaboration (HRC) environments. We investigated whether optimized parameters increase workplace efficiency and whether adapting these parameters to the individual worker improves workplace outcomes. Three experimental scenarios with different CR parameters were analyzed in terms of the setup time, assembly time, finished products, work in process, and worker utilization. The main results show that personalized CR parameters significantly improve efficiency and productivity. The scenario in which CR parameters were tailored to individual workers, balanced the workload, and minimized worker stress, resulting in higher productivity compared to non-people-centric settings. The study shows that personalization reduces cognitive and physical stress, promotes worker well-being, and is consistent with the principles of human-centered manufacturing. Overall, our research supports the adoption of personalized, collaborative workplace parameters, supported by the mathematical model, to optimize employee efficiency and health, contributing to human-centered and efficient HRC environments. © 2024 by the authors.",collaborative workplace; efficiency; human-centered manufacturing; human–robot workplace; modeling; stress index,Machines,2024,Journal,Ojsteršek R.; Buchmeister B.; Javernik A.,10.3390/machines12080546
The Cognitive Load Limits of Multiple Safety Signs,"Current construction safety practices heavily rely on the use of multiple safety signs to mitigate potential risks. This study investigates the cognitive load imposed on construction workers by various design characteristics of safety signs, including text-only, pictogram with text, and pictogram-only signs. A comprehensive cognitive assessment of 513 construction workers was conducted to measure recall rates and visual attention. The results revealed that text-only signs led to lower cognitive load compared with pictogram-based signs, with no significant split-attention effect observed when text and pictograms were combined. The average recall rate across all sign types was 3.32 items, with over 95% of participants recalling six or fewer items. Additionally, recall rates for pictogram-based signs decreased significantly when more than nine items were displayed. Visual attention analysis indicated that while color had no significant impact, the order of placement did. These findings highlight the importance of limiting the number of safety signs and carefully designing them to optimize recall and reduce cognitive load. Future research should explore additional factors such as sex, complexity of work, and environmental conditions to develop a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive load in construction settings. © 2024 by the authors.",cognitive load; construction industry; multiple safety signs; risk communication; working memory,Buildings,2024,Journal,Kwon Y.H.; Kwon Y.B.; Nwagbala D.C.; Park J.Y.,10.3390/buildings14082391
Show Me What's Wrong: Impact of Explicit Alerts on Novice Supervisors of a Multi-Robot Monitoring System,"With the rise of autonomous multi-robot systems, the role of the robot operator shifts from controlling and observing a single robot to that of a supervisor overseeing multiple robots. Previous studies suggest that timely warnings of problematic events improve a user's ability to monitor multiple robots, however, research has not examined the influence alerts have on user monitoring behavior and their perceptions of the system. We present a 2x2 study design where we manipulate the operator's cognitive load through the number of simultaneous robots under their control and the level of support through the absence or presence of warnings. Our findings suggest that users are more likely to fixate on alerts when shown explicitly, and task difficulty influenced the user's willingness to allow the robots to act autonomously. Our research offers insights for advancing the design of autonomous multi-robot interfaces, emphasizing strategies to enhance the simultaneous monitoring of numerous robots. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2024,Conference,Bahodi M.-T.; van Berkel N.; Skov M.B.; Merritt T.R.,10.1145/3686038.3686069
Assessment of a large language model based digital intelligent assistant in assembly manufacturing,"The use of Digital Intelligent Assistants (DIAs) in manufacturing aims to enhance performance and reduce cognitive workload. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research aims to understand the impact of DIAs on assembly processes, emphasizing human-centric design and operational efficiency. The study is novel in considering the three primary objectives: evaluating the technical robustness of DIAs, assessing their effect on operators' cognitive workload and user experience, and determining the overall performance improvement of the assembly process. Methodologically, the research employs a laboratory experiment, incorporating a controlled setting to meticulously assess the DIA's performance. The experiment used a between-subjects design comparing a group of participants using the DIA against a control group relying on traditional manual methods across a series of assembly tasks. Findings reveal a significant enhancement in the operators' experience, a reduction in cognitive load, and an improvement in the quality of process outputs when the DIA is employed. The article contributes to the study of the DIA's potential and AI integration in manufacturing, offering insights into the design, development, and evaluation of DIAs in industrial settings. © 2024 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Experimental design; Industry 4.0; Industry 5.0; Natural language processing,Computers in Industry,2024,Journal,Colabianchi S.; Costantino F.; Sabetta N.,10.1016/j.compind.2024.104129
Construction of a virtual simulation practical teaching system for intelligent manufacturing under the background of new engineering,"To adapt to the new direction of engineering education reform in China under the background of new engineering, and to promote the transformation and upgrading of intelligent manufacturing professionals, a virtual simulation practice teaching system based on Internet technology is constructed. Relying on “online + offline” resources, experimental modules are designed, a course resource library is built, a digital cloud platform is developed, and a “One Body, Two Wings” virtual simulation teaching and training system is established. Practice has shown that the virtual simulation system has the advantages of immersion, interaction, imagination, and reality, which can meet the basic needs of users and provide a safe and immersive experimental operation experience. The comparative data on practical effectiveness shows that virtual simulation teaching has significantly improved students' theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and innovative ability, making graduates highly desirable by enterprises. The virtual simulation system not only enhances user experience, but also improves students' learning effect, professional cognitive ability, and professional practice ability. The system provides strong technical support for the cultivation of intelligent manufacturing professionals, and is an efficient and practical tool in the field of teaching and training, with broad application prospects. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",digital resource system; human–computer interface; improving classroom teaching; virtual reality; virtual simulation practical teaching system,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2024,Journal,Wang Y.; Liu Y.,10.1002/cae.22768
Feasibility and performance enhancement of collaborative control of unmanned ground vehicles via virtual reality,"To support people working in dangerous industries, virtual reality (VR) can ensure operators manipulate standardized tasks and work collaboratively to deal with potential risks. Surprisingly, limited research has paid attention to the cognitive load of operators in their collaborative tasks, especially via VR interfaces. Once task demands become complex, many researchers focus on optimizing the design of the interaction interfaces to reduce the cognitive load on the operator. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative VR system with edge enhancement to support two teleoperators working in the VR environment to remote control an uncrewed ground vehicle. We use a compared experiment to evaluate the collaborative VR systems, focusing on the time spent on tasks and the total number of operations. Our results show that the total number of processes and the cognitive load during operations were significantly lower in the two-person group than in the single-person group. Our study sheds light on designing VR systems to support collaborative work with respect to the flow of work of teleoperators instead of simply optimizing the design outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024. corrected publication 2024.",Collaborative remote control; Human visual augmentation; Teleoperation; Unmanned ground vehicles; Virtual reality,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,2024,Journal,Li Z.; Luo Y.; Wang J.; Pan Y.; Yu L.; Liang H.-N.,10.1007/s00779-024-01799-4
Assembly complexity and physiological response in human-robot collaboration: Insights from a preliminary experimental analysis,"Industry 5.0 paradigm has renewed interest in the human sphere, emphasizing the importance of workers’ well-being in manufacturing activities. In such context, collaborative robotics originated as a technology to support humans in tiring and repetitive tasks. This study investigates the effects of assembly complexity in Human-Robot collaboration using physiological indicators of cognitive effort. In a series of experiments, participants performed assembly processes of different products with varying complexity, in two modalities: manually and with cobot assistance. Physiological measures, including skin conductance, heart rate variability and eye-tracking metrics were collected. The analysis of physiological signals showed trends suggesting the impact of assembly complexity and cobot support. One key finding of the study is that a single physiological signal usually may not provide a complete understanding of cognitive load. Therefore, a holistic approach should be followed. This approach highlighted the importance of considering multiple measures simultaneously to accurately assess workers’ well-being in industrial environments. © 2024 The Author(s)",Assembly complexity; Human-robot collaboration; Humans’ well-being; Industry 5.0; Physiological signals,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2024,Journal,Capponi M.; Gervasi R.; Mastrogiacomo L.; Franceschini F.,10.1016/j.rcim.2024.102789
A knowledge transfer method for human-robot collaborative disassembly of end-of-life power batteries based on augmented reality,"The disassembly of power batteries poses significant challenges due to their complex sources, diverse types, variations in design and manufacturing processes, and diverse service conditions. Human memory capacity and robot cognitive and understanding capabilities are limited when faced with different dismantling tasks for end-of-life power batteries. Insufficient human-computer interaction capabilities greatly hinder the efficiency of human-robot collaboration (HRC) operations. The existing HRC relies heavily on the experience of operators, while the existing disassembly system fails to update new disassembly strategies in real time when facing new battery varieties. Therefore, this paper proposes an augmented reality-assisted human-robot collaboration (AR-HRC) power battery dismantling system based on transfer learning. It consists of three modules: AR-HRC knowledge modeling, dismantling subgraph similarity assessment, and strategy transfer update. The AR-HRC knowledge modeling module aims to establish an intelligent mapping from tasks to collaborative strategies based on part features. Based on the evaluation of task similarity, the mobility assessment model divides subtasks into similar and dissimilar classes. For similar subtasks, the original dismantling strategy can be applied to the current task. However, for different subtasks, operators can issue instructions to the AR-HRC system through the human-computer interaction function of AR and develop new collaborative strategies based on actual conditions. Finally, a case study of power battery dismantling is conducted, and the results show that compared to traditional pre-programmed assembly, this system can improve dismantling efficiency and reduce cognitive burden.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Pupil Responses as Indicators of Learning and Adaptation in Human-Robot Collaboration Scenarios,"The shift towards a more human-centric manufacturing approach in Industry 5.0 emphasizes the integration of technologies that augment rather than replace human capabilities, highlighting the role of collaborative robots (cobots). These cobots, designed to work closely with human operators, bring adaptability and efficiency to the manufacturing floor, adjusting to various tasks and production needs. This integration, while promising, introduces challenges, especially in terms of human adaptation and learning in dynamic work settings. To date, research has primarily focused on the technological advancement of cobots, often overlooking the human component in this collaborative equation. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by employing pupillometry to explore learning effects within human-robot collaboration (HRC), specifically examining human adaptation to complex and extended tasks reflective of industrial environments. Through a multifactorial design involving 19 participants engaged in three trials repeated for two task difficulty levels, the research analyzes performance metrics along with changes in pupil diameter. The results discovered that repetitive task execution is related to decreased operation time and pupil diameter, suggesting reduced cognitive load levels. These findings imply the potential utility of pupillometry as an indicator of human adaptation to complex task execution, promoting further investigation into physiological measures to optimize cobot integration into the workplace.  © 2024 Owner/Author.",Collaborative Cobots; Eye-tracking; Industry 5.0; Task learning,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2024,Conference,Zanardi D.; Nenna F.; Orlando E.M.; Nannetti M.; Mingardi M.; Buodo G.; Gamberini L.,10.1145/3652037.3663909
Effects of multitasking and task interruptions on task performance and cognitive load: considering the moderating role of individual resilience,"Given the complex presentation of multi-source information and the intertwining and fusion of task types, multitasking and task interruptions have become the norm of human-machine cooperative operations in complex industrial systems. Aiming to address nested and overlapping multitasking and task interruptions, this study investigated their interaction mechanisms on task performance and cognitive load. The study utilized AX-CPT and VFT to form a multitasking situation, and simple math problems with positive and negative judgments to form a task interruption. It tested the task performance of 30 subjects under task interruptions (with interruption vs. without interruption) with different task types (single task vs. multitasking) and analyzed the interaction effects of multitasking and task interruptions on task performance and cognitive load. Finally, the study aimed to verify the moderating role of individual resilience. The results showed that (1) multitasking resulted in a significant decrease in correctness, a significant increase in reaction time, and a significant increase in cognitive load; (2) Task interruptions significantly increased reaction time and cognitive load, while they decreased task correctness only during monotasking; this effect was not significant in multitasking; (3) Moderate and high resilience significantly modulated the increase in cognitive load associated with task interruptions during multitasking. These findings are instrumental in optimizing human-machine collaborative job scheduling, enhancing workflow efficiency, identifying the equilibrium between task performance and cognitive load, and providing crucial support for task management and performance improvement. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Individual resilience; Multitasking; Task interruption; Task performance,Current Psychology,2024,Journal,Yuan X.; Zhong L.,10.1007/s12144-024-06094-2
Effect of ergonomic aspects on single- and multiproduct assembly-line balancing problems,"Incorporating ergonomic considerations into an assembly-line balancing problem (ALBP) enhances productivity and minimizes ergonomic concerns. The assembly process, characterized by repetitive motions and handling numerous components, can lead to worker overload. Consequently, the inclusion of ergonomic aspects results in an appropriate distribution of assembly operations and relative workloads. This study investigates a multi-objective ALBP aimed at minimizing the number of workstations, overall skill level required, and variance in workers' energy expenditure across workstations. To address the ALBP while considering the ergonomic aspects, this study proposes an approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) using Pareto optimality. A comparative analysis of the NSGA-II and MOSA is conducted in single- and multiproduct production scenarios, and a computational study involving various factors is performed to identify the dominant algorithm.

Exploring the Effects of Industry 4.0/5.0 on Human Factors: A Preliminary Systematic Literature Review,"Industry 5.0, built on the foundation of Industry 4.0, aims to integrate human capabilities and principles for a sustainable and human-centric industrial paradigm. This article proposes a systematic literature review to explore the empirical effects of Industry 4.0/5.0 (I4.0/5.0) technologies on human factors, emphasizing the often overlooked physical, psychological, and cognitive dimensions. The methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, involved a Scopus search spanning from 2005-2023, ultimately resulting in a selection of 15 articles. The preliminary results depict the studied I4.0/5.0 technologies and their impact on workers' physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects. Some (I4.0/5.0) technologies received significant attention, such as human-robot communication and human-robot interaction, while others remain understudied. The limited number of papers makes it difficult to compare and generalize the empirical results reported. In this regard, we propose avenues for refining this systematic literature review in future research endeavors.

Keep Track! Supporting Spatial Tasks with Augmented Reality Overviews,"In industrial environments, efficient management of task takeovers is critical, especially when tasks are complex and workers face frequent interruptions such as shift changes. These takeovers often increase the cognitive load and the potential for errors. We propose the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) to assist users in handling takeovers of complex, and spatial distributed tasks. We developed three visualization techniques with increasing levels of spatial registration - Diagram View as Baseline, Map View, and Location-bound View - ranging from a simple overview to spatially anchored to enhance spatial and temporal awareness during task takeovers. A comparative user study (n=24) was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in improving task takeovers efficiency. Our results showed that the Location-bound View, in particular, significantly reduced cognitive load and improved task performance by integrating contextual information directly into the user's field of view (FOV). This work provides insights for AR system designers and suggests that AR overviews with increasing levels of spatial registration can effectively support the takeover of complex distributed tasks in industrial settings.  © 2024 ACM.",assembly; assistance; augmented reality; overviews; spatial registration; take over; time criticality,Proceedings - SUI 2024: ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction,2024,Conference,Illing J.; Gruenefeld U.; Heuten W.,10.1145/3677386.3682093
Neurophysiological Approach for Psychological Safety: Enhancing Mental Health in Human–Robot Collaboration in Smart Manufacturing Setups Using Neuroimaging,"Human–robot collaboration (HRC) has become increasingly prevalent due to innovative advancements in the automation industry, especially in manufacturing setups. Although HRC increases productivity and efficacy, it exposes human workers to psychological stress while interfacing with collaborative robotic systems as robots may not provide visual or auditory cues. It is crucial to comprehend how HRC impacts mental stress in order to enhance occupational safety and well-being. Though academics and industrial interest in HRC is expanding, safety and mental stress problems are still not adequately studied. In particular, human coworkers’ cognitive strain during HRC has not been explored well, although being fundamental to sustaining a secure and constructive workplace environment. This study, therefore, aims to monitor the mental stress of factory workers during HRC using behavioural, physiological and subjective measures. Physiological measures, being objective and more authentic, have the potential to replace conventional measures i.e., behavioural and subjective measures, if they demonstrate a good correlation with traditional measures. Two neuroimaging modalities including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been used as physiological measures to track neuronal and hemodynamic activity of the brain, respectively. Here, the correlation between physiological data and behavioural and subjective measurements has been ascertained through the implementation of seven different machine learning algorithms. The results imply that the EEG and fNIRS features combined produced the best results for most of the targets. For subjective measures being the target, linear regression has outperformed all other models, whereas tree and ensemble performed the best for predicting the behavioural measures. The outcomes indicate that physiological measures have the potential to be more informative and often substitute other skewed metrics. © 2024 by the authors.",EEG; fNIRS; human–robot collaboration (HRC); machine learning; mental stress analysis; neuroimaging; occupational safety and wellbeing,Information (Switzerland),2024,Journal,Arif A.; Zakeri Z.; Omurtag A.; Breedon P.; Khalid A.,10.3390/info15100640
Ontology-based Digital Twin for maintenance decisions in manufacturing systems: an application at laboratory scale,"In the Industry 4.0 environment, the maintenance of industrial assets is of increasing importance, and, in this domain, the recently emerged technology of Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) is particularly suitable for the satisfaction of today's manufacturers' needs for flexibility, dynamism, broad vision of the systems, and responsiveness to stimuli. Although this technology shows considerable potential in supporting the execution of maintenance applications with minimum human intervention, in most cases the to-date technological level is not capable of achieving full automation, making the human role still fundamental in relation to the existing Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In this context, this paper proposes the development of an ontology-based DT aiming at supporting the maintenance fault diagnosis decision-making process in manufacturing systems through the synergistic exploitation of the maintenance ontology KARMA supported by algorithms and database technologies integrated with human knowledge. The solution is meant to enable the cognitive capabilities leading toward the CDT concept. The ontology-based Digital Twin has been applied and assessed in the reality-like facility TELMA, at the Research Center for Automatic Control (CRAN) in Nancy, through the implementation of a fault scenario.

The trickle-down effect of strengths use support: examining the linkage between “support from superiors” and “support for subordinates”,"Purpose: Although strengths use support (SUS) has been shown to facilitate employee strengths use and work engagement, little is known about how senior managers’ SUS affects middle managers’ SUS. The purpose of the present research was to examine the trickle-down effect of SUS from superiors on SUS for subordinates. Design/methodology/approach: A two-wave questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from middle managers (n = 228) at a global manufacturing firm in Japan. Findings: The results of structural equation modeling indicated that (1) SUS from superiors indirectly promoted SUS for subordinates mediated through middle managers’ strength use, and (2) SUS from superiors indirectly promoted SUS for subordinates mediated through middle managers’ strength use, and subsequently through their work engagement. Research limitations/implications: As the respondents were middle-level managers at a manufacturing firm in Japan and were all Japanese nationals, indigenous culture and traditional work mentality may have affected the results. Practical implications: To create a supportive learning culture in an organization, human resource (HR) managers need to encourage senior-level managers to provide SUS for middle managers through HR systems such as training, appraisal, and survey feedback. Originality/value: This study may be the first to clarify how SUS from superiors is linked to SUS for subordinates by identifying the mediating effects of strength use and work engagement, based on the Job-Demand Resources model, the Social Cognitive theory, and the trickle-down effect. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Strengths use; Strengths use support; Trickle-down effect; Work engagement,Personnel Review,2024,Journal,Matsuo M.,10.1108/PR-11-2022-0771
Virtual numerical control: an approach towards autonomous manufacturing with a case study in welding,"Today’s customer lifestyles have reshaped their expectations and preferences, driving a growing demand for tailor-made products. While current conventional manufacturing (MNF) systems are robust, they often lack the flexibility needed to accommodate customization. Most MNF systems, despite advances in technology and machinery, still rely on executing predefined instructions, limiting their flexibility. In contrast, human workers excel at handling product variations due to their cognitive abilities, which allow them to perceive, analyze, and make appropriate decisions to adapt to changing conditions. This study introduces virtual numerical control (VNC) as a solution to upgrade MNF systems and overcome these limitations. VNC aims to transform MNF systems into cognitive entities capable of autonomous decision-making, enabling greater flexibility to meet customization demands. To demonstrate the potential of VNC, we implemented it in a welding system as a practical case study. The results showed that VNC enabled the system to operate autonomously. It accurately identified the shape of the objects to be welded, determined the appropriate welding paths, and executed them with high precision, all without human intervention. This highlights the significant potential of VNC technology for broader applications in industrial automation in welding and beyond. © The Author(s) 2024.",Autonomous welding; Cognitive manufacturing systems; Industrial automation; VNC,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2024,Journal,Nasser M.A.; Asy M.M.,10.1007/s00170-024-14598-1
Barriers and enablers for the adoption of sustainable design practices using new design methods – Accelerating the sustainability transformation in the manufacturing industry,"Product development and manufacturing organizations struggle in their sustainability transformation and do not sufficiently contribute to sustainable production and consumption. Design researchers, at the same time, develop and propose a plethora of new and improved design methods that can support the manufacturing industry in such transformation. It is, despite this, well-documented in literature that the industrial adoption of such proposed design methods is challenging. Previous research in the design domain has mainly studied this issue from a process and methodological perspective, whereas previous research in the management domain instead has focused on organizational, and human-behavioral aspects. This poses a research gap for more interdisciplinary research that studies the adoption of design methods from all three perspectives (i.e., process and methodology, organization, and human behavior). Six parallel case studies were carried out with three different product development and manufacturing organizations to collect qualitative empirical data. Glaserian grounded theory was used to analyze the collected data. This resulted in a descriptive framework that captures 53 interdisciplinary factors influencing the adoption of sustainable design practices using new and improved design methods. The descriptive framework is compared to interdisciplinary literature to further clarify and explain the findings, highlighting both practical and theoretical implications. This research provides three main contributions to theory and practice: (1) Two new concepts are introduced and used to explain the empirical findings, which are referred to as the dualism of design methods, and the situational design problem; (2) Nine systemic barriers and eight propositions are formulated, which highlight the need for a paradigm shift in how design is practiced in industry, how cognitive biases inside organizations can lead to a state of pseudo-sustainability, and the need for improved information and data management capabilities in organizations; (3) Sustainable design thinking is proposed as an potential enabler to address several of the main barriers, as it aims to provide a base competence of sustainable design to systematically challenge cognitive biases inside organizations. © 2024 The Authors",Design methods; Glaserian grounded theory; Industrial adoption; Sustainability transformation; Sustainable design practices,Sustainable Production and Consumption,2024,Journal,Mallalieu A.; Isaksson Hallstedt S.; Isaksson O.; Watz M.; Almefelt L.,10.1016/j.spc.2024.08.023
Low-Cost Photoelectric Flow Rate Sensors Based on a Flexible Planar Curved Beam Structure for Clinical Treatments,"In clinical treatments, reliable flow rate measurements ensure accurate drug delivery during infusions, precise gas delivery during artificial ventilations, etc., thereby reducing patient morbidity and mortality. However, precise flow rate sensors are costly, so medical devices with limited budgets choose cheaper but unsatisfactory flow rate measurement approaches, leading to increased medical risks. Here, a photoelectric flow rate sensor based on a flexible planar curved beam structure (FPCBS) is proposed. The FPCBS ensures low out-of-plane stiffness of the sensitive sheet and allows large deformation in the elastic range, enabling the flow rate sensor to measure the flow rate with high sensitivity over a wide range. Meanwhile, the flow rate sensor can be mass-produced using mature materials and manufacturing technology at less than $5 each. The flow rate sensors are integrated into a commercial infusion pump to measure drug infusion and a home ventilator to monitor respiration. The results are comparable to those measured by a commercial flow rate sensor, demonstrating the applicability of the sensor. Considering its proven outstanding performance at low cost, the flow rate sensor shows great potential in clinical treatment, medical diagnosis, and other medical fields. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",flexible structure; medical device; photoelectric flow rate sensor; planar curved beam,Advanced Healthcare Materials,2024,Journal,Cao X.; Li Q.; Li S.; Xu X.; Wang L.; Wang M.; Ding B.; Bao S.; Wang S.; Sun B.; Cui J.; Wang G.; Li H.; Su Y.,10.1002/adhm.202304573
AR/VR assisted integrated framework of autonomous disassembly system for industrial products,"An immersive Augmented Reality (AR) technology enhances productivity and flexibility in manufacturing by providing real-time instructions within workers’ field of view, aiding in complex tasks. According to cognitive load and attention-based theories, AR guidance can reduce cognitive strain, enhancing task performance. The affordance of AR in industrial processes like assembly or disassembly for repair/maintenance has been exploited broadly. However, the prevailing studies on automated user interfaces for AR instruction development, specifically virtual scene creation and target generation for object mapping rendering, still need to be explored. Notably, production industries currently rely on outsourcing skilled professionals to create AR overlaying instructions using manufacturer input. However, the exactness of the disassembly repository is substantial to avoid defects in AR guidance particulars. This underscores the significance of generalized automated AR instruction development and emphasizes the demands for further research. In this work, the autonomous AR-integrated framework is developed for the disassembly context, empowering manufacturers to acquire desired outcomes across various modules. These modules include the validation of the manual user disassembly sequence repository during the prefatory phase of AR instruction creation and the provision of Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) input. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation/rendering of disassembly efforts in a virtual platform and the generation of rendering virtual display scenes for appropriate AR-guided object mapping. Furthermore, it enables the generation of essential model targets for registering the AR scenes. Subsequently, the extracted repositories (virtual scenes and model targets) are input into the Unity AR tool to create AR mapping guidance for disassembly operations. The performance of the autonomous disassembly module is evaluated through three case studies with different AR visualizations. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed framework is exploited by extracting feedback from experts regarding flexibility, compatibility, completion time, and cognitive level. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",AR object mapping; Augmented reality; Automated AR scene extraction; Disassembly sequence; Virtual reality,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2024,Journal,M.

Using gesture and speech communication modalities for safe human-drone interaction in construction,"Drones are increasingly being used in the construction industry for numerous applications. However, their presence poses safety risks to construction workers who work around them but have limited control and information about these drones. To ensure safety, general construction workers who are not part of the pilot teams should also be able to communicate their concerns with drones effectively and naturally. Despite its importance, research on human-drone communication within construction for non-operator workers is scarce. This study developed and evaluated communication protocols using gesture and speech modalities to ensure safe human-drone interactions for non-operator workers in construction environments. An immersive VR environment replicating construction site dynamics was developed, enabling workers to utilize gesture or speech communication protocols while working with drones. A total of 100 participants were recruited for the user-centered study analysis on an immersive VR construction site, and the safety implications and cognitive loads of both protocols were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that gesture-based communication is more effective than speech-based communication in mitigating risks and alleviating the negative impacts of drones without imposing additional cognitive strain on users on construction sites. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Construction; Drone; Gesture; Human-Drone Interaction; Safety; Speech; Virtual Reality (VR),Advanced Engineering Informatics,2024,Journal,Zhu Z.; Cheng J.-Y.; Jeelani I.; Gheisari M.,10.1016/j.aei.2024.102827
Investigating the productivity in different assembly system configurations for a better inclusion of disabled workers,"One of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is focused on decent work and growth which aims to reduce and, finally, remove all barriers for people with a form of diversity like disability. In such a context, manufacturing and production systems should be adapted by adopting specific equipment to help workers with disability while executing jobs according to the type of disability they report. Jobs must be properly planned since disabled workers have physical or cognitive disabilities and specific rights to work. Further, aiming to guarantee a real inclusion of workers with disability production systems should be designed to include these workers in the same working environment as workers without disability. This paper focuses on assembly systems, and it aims to investigate how different designs could impact both the productivity and inclusion of disabled workers. Then, due to the higher variety of products belonging to the same family mixed model assembly systems are considered. For each assembly system design, the daily productivity is calculated by using a simulation approach. Finally, according to the obtained results we provide some considerations about the convenience of adopting parallel flows to guarantee higher inclusion without affecting too much the productivity of the assembly system.

Design for safety training for construction professionals: A digital game-based learning approach,"Globally, there is a pressing need to train more construction professionals in Design for Safety (DfS). Conventional instructional methods like video watching and lectures may not effectively meet professionals’ need for training programmes that are relevant to real-life. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) is a proven educational tool, yet its application in professional DfS training remains inadequately explored. This study examined DGBL's effectiveness using the SafeSim Design game to train construction professionals in DfS. A quasi-experiment was conducted to compare the effect of DGBL with that of online videos covering the same training contents. In total, 246 construction professionals participated in the course and 61 were interviewed or took part in a focus group discussion. We evaluated the change in pre- and post-course quiz scores, assignment scores, questionnaire responses, and qualitative data. We found that DGBL benefitted trainees more equally across different levels of prior experience. The results contribute to the literature by pointing out the importance of occupational background in influencing trainee performance, a factor not well explored in the literature. The results indicate that providing optional scaffolding support and detailed explanations for in-game activities is crucial, as this approach avoids the expertise reversal effect and helps manage trainees’ cognitive load. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of designing and implementing DGBL as an instructional tool for professional training. The above findings inform the development of effective DfS training and contribute to the wider implementation of DfS in construction industry around the world. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Construction safety; Design for Safety; Digital game-based learning; Expertise reversal effect; Professional training,Safety Science,2024,Journal,Tay J.; Safiena S.; Lan T.; Lim M.S.; Goh Y.M.,10.1016/j.ssci.2024.106588
Wrist Extensor Muscle Fatigue During a Dual Task With Two Muscular and Cognitive Load Levels in Younger and Older Adults,"Objective: To examine the effect of concurrent physical and cognitive demands as well as age on indicators of muscle fatigue at the wrist. Background: There are few studies examining risk indicators for musculoskeletal disorders associated with work-related physical and cognitive demands that often occur simultaneously in the workplace. Methods: Twenty-four gender-balanced older and 24 gender-balanced younger (mean age 60 and 23 years) participants performed four 30 min dual tasks. Tasks differed by the muscular load level during force tracking: 5% and 10% of maximum voluntary contraction force (MVC) and concurrent cognitive demands on the working memory: easy and difficult. Muscle fatigue was assessed by MVC decline and changes in surface electromyography (increased root mean square: RMS, decreased median frequency: MF) at the extensor digitorum (ED) and extensor carpi ulnaris (EU). Results: A decline in MVC was found in all participants when tracking was performed at 10% MVC (mean ± SD: 137.9 ± 49.2 – 123.0 ± 45.3 N). Irrespective of age, muscular, or cognitive load, RMS increased (ED 12.3 ± 6.5 – 14.1 ± 7.0% MVE, EU 15.4 ± 7.6 – 16.9 ± 8.6% MVE) and MF decreased (ED 85.4 ± 13.6 – 83.2 ± 12.8 Hz, EU 107.2 ± 17.1 – 104.3 ± 16.7 Hz) in both muscles. However, changes in MF of EU tended to be more pronounced in the older group at higher cognitive and lower muscular load, without reaching statistical significance. Conclusion: Maximum voluntary contraction indicated no interaction between muscle fatigue, cognitive load, or age. However, the tendencies toward altered muscle activity due to an increase in cognitive load and older age suggest muscular adaptations while maintaining tracking performance during the onset of fatigue signs in the sEMG signal. Application: If the tendencies in muscle activity are confirmed by further studies, ergonomic assessments in industrial workplaces should consider cognitive load and age when describing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. © 2023 The Author(s).",cognitive task; maximum voluntary contraction force; muscle fatigue; surface electromyography; tracking task; wrist extensors,Human Factors,2024,Journal,Wagenblast F.; Läubli T.; Seibt R.; Rieger M.A.; Steinhilber B.,10.1177/00187208231218196
Co2iAR: Co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative industrial AR wiring harness assembly,"Existing augmented reality (AR) assembly mainly provides visual instructions for operators from a first-person perspective, and it is hard to share individual working intents for co-located workers on the shop floor, especially for large-scale product assembly task that requires multiple operators working together. To bridge this gap for practical deployments, this paper proposes Co2iAR, a co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative AR assembly. Firstly, according to the stereo visual-inertial fusion strategy, robust and accurate self-contained motion tracking is achieved for the resource-constrained mobile AR platform, followed by a co-located alignment from multiple mobile AR clients on the shop floor. Then, a lightweight text-aware network for online wiring harness character recognition is proposed, as well as the audio-based confirming strategy, enabling natural audio-visual interaction among co-located workers within a shared immersive workplace, which can also monitor the current wiring assembly status and activate the step-by-step tutorials automatically. The novelty of this work is focused on the deployment of audio-visual aware interaction using the same device that is being used to deploy the co-located collaborative AR work instructions, establishing shared operating intents among multiple co-located workers. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on the collaborative performance among multiple AR clients, and results illustrate that the proposed Co2iAR can alleviate the cognitive load and achieve superior performance for the co-located AR assembly tasks, providing a more human-centric collaborative assembly performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",audio-visual interaction; Augmented reality; co-located AR; collaborative assembly,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2024,Journal,Fang W.; Chen L.; Zhang T.; Hu H.; Bi J.,10.1016/j.rcim.2024.102795
A neuroergonomics model for evaluating nuclear power plants operators’ performance under heat stress driven by ECG time-frequency spectrums and fNIRS prefrontal cortex network: A CNN-GAT fusion model,"Operators experience complicated physiological and psychological states when exposed to extreme heat stress, which can impair cognitive function and decrease performance significantly, ultimately leading to severe secondary disasters. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a feasible technique to identify their abnormal states to enhance the reliability of human-cybernetics systems. With the advancement of deep learning in physiological modeling, a model for evaluating operators’ performance driven by electrocardiogram (ECG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was proposed, demonstrating high ecological validity. The model fused a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a graph attention network (GAT) backbone to extract discriminative features from ECG time-frequency spectrums and fNIRS prefrontal cortex (PFC) network respectively with deeper neuroscience domain knowledge, and eventually achieved 0.90 AUC. Results supported that handcrafted features extracted by specialized neuroscience methods can alleviate overfitting. Inspired by the small-world nature of the brain network, the fNIRS PFC network was organized as an undirected graph and embedded by GAT. It is proven to perform better in information aggregation and delivery compared to a simple non-linear transformation. The model provides a potential neuroergonomics application to evaluate the human state in vital human-cybernetics systems under industry 5.0 scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Electrocardiogram; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy; Graph attention network; Heat stress; Neuroergonomics,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2024,Journal,Zhang Y.; Jia M.; Chen T.; Li M.; Wang J.; Hu X.; Xu Z.,10.1016/j.aei.2024.102563
A new XR-based human‐robot collaboration assembly system based on industrial metaverse,"The industrial metaverse is an emerging paradigm of integrated information technologies. A human-robot collaboration assembly system is developed using extended reality (XR) and blockchain technologies. This system includes the physical, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) supporting, and blockchain systems. Virtual avatars represent physical operators and mobile robots in the XR environment. The VR system emulates real-time physical operations, facilitating pre-planning, online task optimization, and converting strategic decisions into executable instructions for physical robots. The AR system enhances the cognitive experience of intelligent operators, contributing to decision-making and VR system control through multi-modal interactions. The integration of the VR and AR systems in perception-decision-control enables real-time process optimization and the reverse control of physical operations. The system is implemented using a decentralized blockchain and end-edge-cloud collaborative network architecture to regulate interaction permissions for each scene characters, ensuring systematic functionality, robust communication, and comprehensive data management. A case study of a gearbox assembly is used to demonstrate the system's development and efficacy. The results indicate the VR system's comprehensive perception and the AR system's detailed insights, yielding reliable information on global and local levels. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and spatiotemporal visualization during VR decision-making provides computational advantages. Incorporating human input into the AR system enables human-in-the-loop operational decision-making, providing optimal instructions to improve human-robot collaboration performance.

Ergonomic analysis in nuclear decommissioning: A comprehensive path planning strategy for workers well-being,"Recent studies on path planning in nuclear decommissioning focus on efficient algorithms, often overlooking workers’ physical and cognitive well-being. However, there is a need to consider the effect of the paths recommended by algorithms on workers’ health to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This study introduces a computational dynamic body map tool designed to assess and monitor musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among workers in high-risk decommissioning environments. Utilizing color-coded body maps, the study identifies key ergonomic risk factors and their impact on different body parts. The strategy begins by identifying job tasks requiring ergonomic assessment, distilling the tasks into different activities and the time spent on each activity, and using the result to dynamically compute the average pain severity experienced by workers across different body parts. Subsequent body mapping, hazard surveys, and structured interviews are used to rank workplace risks and worker-specific risk factors. The major contribution of this work is the development of a computational dynamic tool to regularly track worker body maps regularly, ensuring optimal performance. To evaluate the proposed strategy, the study utilized data from a 35-response online MSD questionnaire for safety professionals. To demonstrate the methodology across diverse roles, 10 worker examples were analyzed, aligning with 5 key IAEA nuclear decommissioning categories. Analysis of the computational dynamic body map data reveals specific pain distributions among workers. The most severe pain occurs in the lower back (13.08 %), followed by the right wrist/hand (10 %), the right shoulder, the left elbow (8.46 % each), the left shoulder, the upper back (7.69 % each), the neck and the left wrist/hand (6.92 % each). The findings further reveal that the 36–45 years age category experiences the most pain. In addition, awkward posture was found in the study to be the most likely ergonomic risk factor affecting workers. The results show that incorporating ergonomics into path planning aids risk-informed decision-making for ergonomic interventions and continuous monitoring to maintain a safe and healthier workplace. Integrating the tool presented in this work with a conventional path-planning algorithm provides a comprehensive path-planning strategy for nuclear decommissioning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Digital Health Tracking; Ergonomics; Nuclear Decommissioning; Occupational Health; Path Planning; Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorder,Nuclear Engineering and Design,2024,Journal,Onyinyechukwu Adibeli J.; Liu Y.-K.; Junior Awodi N.; Kipkosgei Chepkwony A.; Ayodeji A.,10.1016/j.nucengdes.2024.113409
Eye-Tracking in Physical Human–Robot Interaction: Mental Workload and Performance Prediction,"Background: In Physical Human–Robot Interaction (pHRI), the need to learn the robot’s motor-control dynamics is associated with increased cognitive load. Eye-tracking metrics can help understand the dynamics of fluctuating mental workload over the course of learning. Objective: The aim of this study was to test eye-tracking measures’ sensitivity and reliability to variations in task difficulty, as well as their performance-prediction capability, in physical human–robot collaboration tasks involving an industrial robot for object comanipulation. Methods: Participants (9M, 9F) learned to coperform a virtual pick-and-place task with a bimanual robot over multiple trials. Joint stiffness of the robot was manipulated to increase motor-coordination demands. The psychometric properties of eye-tracking measures and their ability to predict performance was investigated. Results: Stationary Gaze Entropy and pupil diameter were the most reliable and sensitive measures of workload associated with changes in task difficulty and learning. Increased task difficulty was more likely to result in a robot-monitoring strategy. Eye-tracking measures were able to predict the occurrence of success or failure in each trial with 70% sensitivity and 71% accuracy. Conclusion: The sensitivity and reliability of eye-tracking measures was acceptable, although values were lower than those observed in cognitive domains. Measures of gaze behaviors indicative of visual monitoring strategies were most sensitive to task difficulty manipulations, and should be explored further for the pHRI domain where motor-control and internal-model formation will likely be strong contributors to workload. Application: Future collaborative robots can adapt to human cognitive state and skill-level measured using eye-tracking measures of workload and visual attention. © 2023, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",motor learning; psychometrics; reliability; strategies; virtual environments,Human Factors,2024,Journal,Upasani S.; Srinivasan D.; Zhu Q.; Du J.; Leonessa A.,10.1177/00187208231204704
The impact of Industry 4.0 on occupational health and safety: A systematic literature review,"Introduction: Industry 4.0 has brought new paradigms to businesses based on high levels of automation and interconnectivity and the use of technologies. This new context has an impact on the work environment and workers. Nevertheless, these impacts are still inconclusive and controversial, requiring new investigative perspectives. This study aimed to investigate the requirements sought, the risk factors identified, and the adverse effects on workers caused by the characteristics of I4.0. Method: The methodology was based on a systematic literature review utilizing the PRISMA protocol, and 30 articles were found eligible. A descriptive and bibliometric analysis of these studies was performed. Results: The results identified the main topics that emerged and have implications for workers' Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and divided them into categories. The requirements are related mainly to cognitive, organizational, and technological demands. The most significant risk factors generated were associated with the psychosocial ones, but organizational, technological, and occupational factors were also identified. The adverse effects cited were categorized as psychic, cognitive, physical, and organizational; stress was the most cited effect. An explanatory theoretical model of interaction was proposed to represent the pathway of causal relations between the requirements and risk factors for the effects caused by I4.0. Conclusions and practical applications: This review has found just how complex the relationships between the principles of Industry 4.0 are (e.g., requirements, risk factors, and effects) and the human factors. It also suggests a pathway for how these relationships occur, bridging the gap left by the limited studies focused on connecting these topics. These results can help organizational managers understand the impacts of I4.0 on workers' safety and health. © 2024 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd",Human factors and Ergonomics (HF/E); OHS impacts; Operator 4.0; Psychosocial factors; Requirements,Journal of Safety Research,2024,Journal,Bispo L.G.M.; Amaral F.G.,10.1016/j.jsr.2024.04.009
Enhancing human-guided robotic assembly: AR-assisted DT for skill-based and low-code programming,"Efficient and natural programming strategies play a crucial role in enabling human-guided robotic assembly to adapt quickly to dynamic tasks. The combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twins (DT) has shown promising potential in enhancing the intuitiveness of human–robot interaction while leveraging digital representations of human intelligence to empower robots in manufacturing tasks. However, traditional programming methods lack intuitive interaction and rely heavily on simulation environments or pre-set CAD models, leading to high costs for both initial setup and sim-to-real deployment. On the other hand, existing AR-based robot control methods have primarily focused on the basic movements of robots, overlooking higher-level skills necessary for complex tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces a four-layer system architecture that integrates AR-assisted DT into skill-based robotic assembly scenarios. Additionally, a skill-based and low-code programming system for human-guided robotic assembly is designed and implemented, which incorporates natural human guidance and robot autonomous intelligence to generate adaptive and feasible action plans. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are verified by two case studies and a quantitative experiment comparing to traditional programming methods. The results demonstrate the usability of our AR-assisted DT approach in improving programming efficiency, intuitiveness, and safety for human-guided robotic assembly while reducing cognitive load. © 2024",Augmented reality; Digital twin; Human–robot interaction; Robot programming; Robotic assembly,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2024,Journal,Yin Y.; Zheng P.; Li C.; Wan K.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.04.016
Bridging minds and machines in Industry 5.0: neurobiological approach,"Introduction: In transitioning from Industry 4.0 to the forthcoming Industry 5.0, this research explores the fusion of the humanistic view and technological developments to redefine Continuing Engineering Education (CEE). Industry 5.0 introduces concepts like biomanufacturing and human-centricity, embodying the integration of sustainability and resiliency principles in CEE, thereby shaping the upskilling and reskilling initiatives for the future workforce. The interaction of sophisticated concepts such as Human-Machine Interface and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) forms a conceptual bridge toward the approaching Fifth Industrial Revolution, allowing one to understand human beings and the impact of their biological development across diverse and changing workplace settings. Methods: Our research is based on recent studies into Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities taxonomies, linking these elements with dynamic labor market profiles. This work intends to integrate a biometric perspective to conceptualize and describe how cognitive abilities could be represented by linking a Neuropsychological test and a biometric assessment. We administered the brief Neuropsychological Battery in Spanish (Neuropsi Breve). At the same time, 15 engineering students used the Emotiv insight device that allowed the EEG recollection to measure performance metrics such as attention, stress, engagement, and excitement. Results: The findings of this research illustrate a methodology that allowed the first approach to the cognitive abilities of engineering students to be from neurobiological and behavioral perspectives. Additionally, two profiles were extracted from the results. The first illustrates the Neuropsi test areas, its most common mistakes, and its performance ratings regarding the students' sample. The second profile shows the interaction between the EEG and Neuropsi test, showing engineering students' cognitive and emotional states based on biometric levels. Discussions: The study demonstrates the potential of integrating neurobiological assessment into engineering education, highlighting a significant advancement in addressing the skills requirements of Industry 5.0. The results suggest that obtaining a comprehensive understanding of students' cognitive abilities is possible, and educational interventions can be adapted by combining neuropsychological approaches with EEG data collection. In the future, it is essential to refine these evaluation methods further and explore their applicability in different engineering disciplines. Additionally, it is necessary to investigate the long-term impact of these methods on workforce preparation and performance.

Optimizing Human–Robot Teaming Performance through Q-Learning-Based Task Load Adjustment and Physiological Data Analysis,"The transition to Industry 4.0 and 5.0 underscores the need for integrating humans into manufacturing processes, shifting the focus towards customization and personalization rather than traditional mass production. However, human performance during task execution may vary. To ensure high human–robot teaming (HRT) performance, it is crucial to predict performance without negatively affecting task execution. Therefore, to predict performance indirectly, significant factors affecting human performance, such as engagement and task load (i.e., amount of cognitive, physical, and/or sensory resources required to perform a particular task), must be considered. Hence, we propose a framework to predict and maximize the HRT performance. For the prediction of task performance during the development phase, our methodology employs features extracted from physiological data as inputs. The labels for these predictions—categorized as accurate performance or inaccurate performance due to high/low task load—are meticulously crafted using a combination of the NASA TLX questionnaire, records of human performance in quality control tasks, and the application of Q-Learning to derive task-specific weights for the task load indices. This structured approach enables the deployment of our model to exclusively rely on physiological data for predicting performance, thereby achieving an accuracy rate of 95.45% in forecasting HRT performance. To maintain optimized HRT performance, this study further introduces a method of dynamically adjusting the robot’s speed in the case of low performance. This strategic adjustment is designed to effectively balance the task load, thereby enhancing the efficiency of human–robot collaboration. © 2024 by the authors.",human–robot teaming; machine learning; performance maximization; performance prediction; physiological data; Q-learning; task engagement; task load,Sensors,2024,Journal,Korivand S.; Galvani G.; Ajoudani A.; Gong J.; Jalili N.,10.3390/s24092817
Enhancing Fault Troubleshooting through Human-Machine Collaboration: A Multi-Stage Reasoning Approach,"Ensuring the stable operation of critical industrial equipment is pivotal for maintaining production efficiency and economic gains. The complexity of modern industrial machinery, however, places a substantial cognitive load on maintenance personnel. To alleviate this, a Diagnostic Semantic-Enhanced Fault Causality Knowledge Graph (DSFCKG) is proposed to formalize fault information for computational analysis. Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) method is introduced for the automated assembly of DSFCKG. Building upon this, a multi-stage reasoning approach is designed for human-machine collaborative fault Troubleshooting. Experiments on real-world fault tickets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances fault diagnosis and troubleshooting accuracy, especially in complex scenarios with long fault causal chains, which bring insights into futuristic smart maintenance. © 2024 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering,2024,Conference,Wen S.; Chen Y.; Pan X.; Zhuang W.; Li X.,10.1109/CASE59546.2024.10711734
Geting Closer to Real-world: Monitoring Humans Working with Collaborative Industrial Robots,"Detecting behavior and cognitive states of operators collaborating with industrial robots in the field is among the primary objectives and challenges in current human-robot collaboration research. To achieve this goal, it is first essential to introduce dynamic elements of the industrial settings into the lab to examine how to effectively detect, read, and interpret operators' psychophysical reactions associated with complex and dynamic workflows. As a first step toward this goal, we designed a realistic collaborative assembly task, encompassing common manufacturing operations performed jointly by humans and cobots. The task involves sequential sub-operations in a practical workflow (manual screwing, pick-and-place, supported screwing) and dual-tasking simulating conditions of fatigue and high workload. Early results cover users' performance, mental workload, and affective reactions, along with acceptance, engagement, and participants' perception of the experimenter's influence on the task execution. We finally discuss how such an experimental approach represents a first step toward field-based interventions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Assembly task; Human measurements; Human-Robot Collaboration; Industry 5.0; Robotics,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,2024,Conference,Nenna F.; Zanardi D.; Orlando E.M.; Nannetti M.; Buodo G.; Gamberini L.,10.1145/3610978.3640632
Facilitation or hindrance: The contingent effect of organizational artificial intelligence adoption on proactive career behavior,"The advent of Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is catalyzing significant transformations in human work dynamics. Nonetheless, there exists no unanimous consensus among researchers regarding whether organizational AI adoption has a favorable or unfavorable impact on employees' career development. Building upon social cognitive theory, we explores the underlying mechanism through which organizational AI adoption influences employees' proactive career behavior. A three-wave time-lagged survey involving 348 employees from three hotels and five advanced manufacturing enterprises in Chengdu, China, was conducted. The findings revealed that organizational AI adoption led to a reduction in employees' self-perceived employability. The prominence of an employee's future work self-salience was found to be a determining factor in how their self-perceived employability influenced proactive career behaviors. Specifically, this impact manifested negative for employees exhibiting high levels of future work self-salience, while it appears positive for those with low levels. Finally, this study confirmed the moderating role of future work self-salience in the indirect impact of organizational AI adoption on proactive career behavior through self-perceived employability. Our study underscores the significance of considering individual characteristics, such as future work self-salience, in analyzing how organizational AI adoption affects employees' career-related behaviors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Future work self-salience; Organizational AI adoption; Proactive career behavior; Self-perceived employability,Computers in Human Behavior,2024,Journal,Lin H.; Tian J.; Cheng B.,10.1016/j.chb.2023.108092
Determining Cognitive Workload Using Physiological Measurements: Pupillometry and Heart-Rate Variability,"The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing systems has accelerated in recent years, with a shift towards understanding operators’ well-being and resilience within the context of creating a human-centric manufacturing environment. In addition to measuring physical workload, monitoring operators’ cognitive workload is becoming a key element in maintaining a healthy and high-performing working environment in future digitalized manufacturing systems. The current approaches to the measurement of cognitive workload may be inadequate when human operators are faced with a series of new digitalized technologies, where their impact on operators’ mental workload and performance needs to be better understood. Therefore, a new method for measuring and determining the cognitive workload is required. Here, we propose a new method for determining cognitive-workload indices in a human-centric environment. The approach provides a method to define and verify the relationships between the factors of task complexity, cognitive workload, operators’ level of expertise, and indirectly, the operator performance level in a highly digitalized manufacturing environment. Our strategy is tested in a series of experiments where operators perform assembly tasks on a Wankel Engine block. The physiological signals from heart-rate variability and pupillometry bio-markers of 17 operators were captured and analysed using eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant differences in both cardiac and pupillometry-based cognitive load indices across the four task complexity levels (rest, low, medium, and high). Notably, these developed indices also provide better indications of cognitive load responding to changes in complexity compared to other measures. Additionally, while experts appear to exhibit lower cognitive loads across all complexity levels, further analysis is required to confirm statistically significant differences. In conclusion, the results from both measurement sensors are found to be compatible and in support of the proposed new approach. Our strategy should be useful for designing and optimizing workplace environments based on the cognitive load experienced by operators. © 2024 by the authors.",cognitive workload; cognitive-workload index; heart-rate variability; pupillometry; task performance,Sensors,2024,Journal,Ma X.; Monfared R.; Grant R.; Goh Y.M.,10.3390/s24062010
Social Signal Modeling in Human-Robot Interaction,"This workshop focuses on the understanding and modeling of social signals to create human-aware HRI. The three fundamental themes are: understanding social signals (gain insights into human internal states), modeling social signals for the generation of a human's mental state (translating social signals into actionable computational models), and operationalizing human models for human-aware applications (integrating these cognitive models into robotic systems to develop new human-aware capabilities). The invited speakers, paper presentations, and discussions will aim to focus on the social science background of social signals, acquisition and availability of benchmarking datasets, social signal modeling techniques, integration of models into real-time systems, usage of these models-such as error management, personalization, and mental model alignment-and applications of these models (i.e., healthcare, education, manufacturing). We expect these topics to demonstrate how modeling social signals, both explicit and implicit, is necessary for fluent, intuitive and trustworthy interactions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Datasets; HRI; Human Behavior Modeling; Social Signals,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,2024,Conference,Stiber M.; Spitale M.; Gunes H.; Huang C.-M.,10.1145/3610978.3638163
Cognitive technology development and end-user involvement in the Norwegian petroleum industry – Human factors missing or not?,"The petroleum industry is a high-hazard industry depending on reliable technical solutions. The industry tends to use increasingly advanced technologies including machine learning technology with increased difficulties for end users to keep abreast of how these technologies work. Thus, our research question was: How are end users involved in the development and implementation of cognitive technologies in the Norwegian petroleum industry to contribute to safe and reliable technical solutions? We used a qualitative explorative approach, with semistructured interviews with 31 informants from 10 companies. Thematic analysis revealed the categories ‘technology focus’, ‘understanding of end-user involvement versus end users’ actual involvement’, ‘lack of access to end users’, ‘lack of human factors methods in early phases’, and ‘lack of official rules and regulations’. Findings show that during the earlier phases of designing algorithms and training data, end users are hardly involved. Regarding later phases with offshore testing, implementation, use, and improvement, end users are much more integrated in the process. © 2023 The Author(s)",Artificial intelligence; Automated technology; Cognitive technology; End-user involvement; Human factors; Petroleum; Technology development,Safety Science,2024,Journal,Sætren G.B.; Ernstsen J.; Phillips R.; Aulie E.G.; Stenhammer H.C.,10.1016/j.ssci.2023.106337
Leveraging cognitive digital twins in industry 5.0 for achieving sustainable development goal 9: An exploration of inclusive and sustainable industrialization strategies,"In the emerging landscape of Industry 5.0, the integration of innovative technologies such as Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) is pivotal for steering industrial processes towards sustainability and inclusivity, particularly in developing nations striving to align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study explores the transformative capabilities of CDTs in Industry 5.0, concentrating on India's quest for inclusive and sustainable industrialization in alignment with SDGs. The inclusion of the TOE-HOT framework enriches the research's analytical foundation, providing a nuanced perspective to investigate the multifaceted dynamics of technology, organization, environment, and human aspects within the sphere of industrial evolution.

Analyzing psychophysical state and cognitive performance in human-robot collaboration for repetitive assembly processes,"One of the main paradigms of Industry 5.0 is represented by human-robot collaboration (HRC), which aims to support humans in production processes. However, working entire shifts in close contact with a robotic system may introduce new hazards from a cognitive ergonomics perspective. This paper presents a methodological approach to monitor the evolution of the operator’s psychophysical state noninvasively in shifts of a repetitive assembly process, focusing on stress, mental workload, and fatigue. Through the use of non-invasive biosensors, it is possible to obtain objective information, even in real time, on the operator’s cognitive load and stress in a naturalistic manner (i.e., without interrupting or hindering the process). In the HRC setting, recognition of the operator’s psychophysical state is the first step in supporting his or her well-being and can provide clues to improve collaboration. The proposed method was applied to a case study aimed at comparing shifts performed both manually and with a cobot of a repetitive assembly process. The results showed significant differences in terms of process performance evolution and psychophysical state of the operator. In particular, the presence of the cobot resulted in fewer process failures, stress and cognitive load especially in the first phase of the work shift. The case study analyzed also showed the adequacy of noninvasively collected physiological data in providing important information on the evolution of the operator’s stress, cognitive load, and fatigue. © 2023, The Author(s).",Cognitive ergonomics; Human-robot collaboration; Industry 5.0; Physiological data; Process failures; Repetitive assembly,Production Engineering,2024,Journal,Gervasi R.; Capponi M.; Mastrogiacomo L.; Franceschini F.,10.1007/s11740-023-01230-6
Development of Variable Scaling Teleoperation Framework for Improving Teleoperation Performance,"Teleoperation systems have been used in various industrial field to extend abilities of operator. However, different characteristics between master device and slave robot, and limited information from a remote environment increase difficulties of teleoperation and the cognitive load of operators. In this study, we propose the user controlled variable scaling teleoperation framework to improve manipulation abilities for both contact and non-contact tasks. The proposed framework includes the position scaling mode, impedance scaling mode and unit process recognition system. The operator can modulate a position scale or impedance scale of slave robot in real-time. The scaling mode is switched between two scaling mode according to a result of the unit process recognition system. The unit process recognition system recognizes whether a current subtask is a contact task or non-contact task. Teleoperation experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed teleoperation framework. Contact force, task completion time, and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) were measured to evaluate the performance of operators. Using the proposed framework reduced the contact force, completion time and NASA-TLX score by 48.9%, 20.2% and 36.6%, respectively, compared to the fixed-scale teleoperation framework. Results of experiments show that the proposed framework improves manipulation abilities for both non-contact and contact tasks. © ICROS, KIEE and Springer 2024.",Extending manipulation ability; impedance scaling; improve teleoperation performance; position scaling; unit process recognition system,"International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems",2024,Journal,Lee H.; Han J.; Yang G.-H.,10.1007/s12555-022-1099-z
Towards a Cognition-Based Framework Describing Interdisciplinary Expert Team Processes for Cognitive Robotics in Industry 5.0 Technologies,"With the evolution of traditional production towards smart manufacturing, humans and machines interact dynamically to handle complex production systems in semi-automated environments when full automation is not possible. To avoid undesirable side effects, and to exploit the full performance potential of experts, it is crucial to consider the human perspective when developing new technologies. Specifically, human sub-tasks during machine operation must be described to gain insights into cognitive processes. This research proposes a cognition-based framework by integrating a number of known psychological concepts. The focus is on the description of cognitive (team) processes in the resolution of anomalies within a manufacturing process with interdisciplinary experts working together. An observational eye tracking study with retrospective think-aloud interviews (N = 3) provides empirical evidence for all cognitive processes proposed in the framework, such as regular process monitoring and—in case of a detected anomaly—diagnosis, problem solving, and resolution. Moreover, the role of situation awareness, individual expertise and (cognitive) team processes is analyzed and described. Further, implications regarding a human-centered development of future production systems are discussed. The present research provides a starting point for understanding and supporting cognitive (team) processes during intelligent manufacturing that will dominate the production landscape within Industry 5.0. © 2024 by the authors.",cognitive robotics; cognitive systems engineering; expertise; human-cyber-physical production systems; Industry 5.0; robotic roll forming; situation awareness,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2024,Journal,Morgenstern T.; Klichowicz A.; Bengler P.; Todtermuschke M.; Bocklisch F.,10.3390/app14104121
Updating design guidelines for cognitive ergonomics in human-centred collaborative robotics applications: An expert survey,"Within the framework of Industry 5.0, human factors are essential for enhancing the work conditions and well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart manufacturing systems and machines and increasing production performances. Nevertheless, cognitive ergonomics is often underestimated when implementing advanced industrial human-robot interaction. Thus, this work aims to systematically update, develop, and validate guidelines to assist non-experts in the early stages of the design of anthropocentric and collaborative assembly applications by focusing on the main features that have positively influenced workers' cognitive responses. A methodology for structured development has been proposed. The draft guidelines have been created starting from the outcomes of a systematic and extended screening of the scientific literature. Preliminary validation has been carried out with the help of researchers working in the field. Inputs on comprehensibility and relevance have been gathered to enhance the guidelines. Lastly, a survey was used to examine in depth how international experts in different branches can interpret such guidelines. In total, 108 responders were asked to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the guideline's comprehensibility and provide general comments or suggestions for each guideline. Based on the survey's results, the guidelines have been validated and some have been reviewed and re-written in their final form. The present work highlights that integrating human factors into the design of collaborative applications can significantly bolster manufacturing operations' resilience through inclusivity and system adaptability by enhancing worker safety, ergonomics, and wellbeing. © 2024 The Authors",Cognitive ergonomics; Collaborative robotics; Human-centred design; Human-robot interaction; Industry 5.0,Applied Ergonomics,2024,Journal,Gualtieri L.; Fraboni F.; Brendel H.; Pietrantoni L.; Vidoni R.; Dallasega P.,10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104246

Assessing user performance in augmented reality assembly guidance for industry 4.0 operators,"In the realm of smart manufacturing, Augmented Reality (AR) technology has gained increasing attention among researchers and manufacturers due to its practicality and adaptability. For this reason, it has been widely embraced in various industrial fields, especially for helping operators assemble products. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a debate in the research community about how effective AR is for improving user performance in assembly tasks, particularly when using handheld devices. These disparities can be attributed to differences in experimental approaches, such as the frequent use of qualitative methods, the inclusion of non-representative users, and the limited number of comprehensive case studies. In response to this, the paper delved into the benefits of AR applications, with a specific focus on measuring user performance and the cognitive workload perceived by users during assembly activities. To this end, an AR assembly guidance tool has been developed to assist users during assembly tasks, running on a mobile device, specifically a tablet, for freedom of movement and high portability. Experimentation involved the assembly of a comprehensive case study and a diverse user group, allowing the comparison representative users and experienced industrial operators. The results were promising, indicating that AR technology effectively enhances user performance during assembly-guided activities compared to conventional methods, particularly when users are unfamiliar with the task at hand. This study brings valuable insights by addressing previous research limitations and providing strong evidence of AR's positive impact on user performance in real-world assembly scenarios. © 2024 The Authors",AR Foundation; Assembly guidance; Augmented Reality; Hand-held devices; Industry 4.0; User performance,Computers in Industry,2024,Journal,Marino E.; Barbieri L.; Bruno F.; Muzzupappa M.,10.1016/j.compind.2024.104085
"GRAAL—modeling, prototyping and assessing a gamified responsible augmented assembly line system","Human errors are prevalent in manual assembly line statistics, but humans are still a necessary and numerous working force for assembly tasks. Since faster and shorter production cycles lead to higher mental efforts, an alternative to decrease the cognitive load and errors of manual assembly lines is using augmented reality (AR). AR increases system interaction and assists operators in the step-by-step of any tasks performed. Its use allows granular production data, enabling an increase in quality control and timely detection of assembly problems. However, AR alone is not enough to avoid demotivation and lack of engagement in the task, which is repetitive. Gamification can become an auxiliary resource to increase operators’ motivation and engagement. This paper presents a system model to integrate AR and gamification for a manual assembly line of printed circuit boards (PCBs) called GRAAL, used to develop an actual system for PCB assembly, which can guide operators using AR but also tracks down their efficiency and efficacy which is then used for gamifying their performance. A prototype system was implemented and assessed by 34 specialist respondents. TAM 3 (Technology Acceptance Model 3) Questionnaire was used to assess the system, which allowed us to find that GRAAL was well accepted (all scores were above the center of a Likert scale from 1 to 7 values), suggesting that GRAAL may be useful as an auxiliary resource to manual assembly lines. We conclude that modeling a system that merges AR and gamification is feasible but a non-trivial task in industry. The system’s features are dependent on conditioning factors such as Application Environment, Application Context, Application Audience, AR hardware, and gamification elements. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",Augmented reality; Gamification; Industry 4.0; Manual assembly lines; Manufacturing,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2024,Journal,Agati S.S.; Hounsell M.D.S.; Paterno A.S.,10.1007/s00170-024-13460-8
"Working Conditions of Industrial Robot Operators-An Overview of Technology Dissemination, Job Characteristics, and Health Indicators in Modern Production Workplaces","Flexible robotic systems change not only the production workflow as a whole but also the individual working conditions of their operators. The aim of this analysis of our study with more than 5900 participants was to get an overview of demographics, job characteristics, and health indicators of robot operators in comparison to nonrobotic machine operators and employees in Germany. We collected data by telephone interviews measuring technology use, stressors, and resources at work as well as health indicators. Results indicate systematic differences in working stressors and resources for robot users compared to other machine users as well as employees in general. In particular, the scope for decision-making at work was smaller for robot users, especially regarding the amount of work or the speed of work. Only isolated links could be found regarding the health indicators. The results therefore imply constant consideration of human factors to ensure productive as well as healthy working conditions with robots in modern industry. © 2013 IEEE.",Cognitive ergonomics; human factors; human-robot interaction; robots,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,2024,Journal,Hartwig M.; Rosen P.; Wischniewski S.,10.1109/THMS.2024.3368525
Multimodal data extraction and analysis for the implementation of Temporal Action Segmentation models in Manufacturing,"With Industry 5.0, operators' physical and cognitive behavior is crucial in any field, particularly manufacturing and production lines. To this end, the need to monitor humans performing specific tasks when working alongside robotic systems has grown further. Guaranteeing the well-being of operators sharing a workspace with industrial robots can drastically reduce risky and harmful situations for the operators while leading the robot to adapt to humans fully. For this purpose, monitoring systems can be very helpful in studying the most suitable deep learning methodologies to obtain information from the movements of the individual operator performing a specific task. Therefore, action segmentation can be fundamental to establishing a new and safe way of communication among operators and robots. In this work, a system for segmenting actions performed by operators assembling an industrial object is developed. The public HA4M dataset has been used to train and test temporal action segmentation models by using MS-TCN++ architecture. Highly discriminant features have been extracted from the dataset, and different training approaches based on multimodal data, including RGB and skeletal joints in Depth and RGB resolutions, have been considered.

Making Cognitive Ergonomics in the Human–Computer Interaction of Manufacturing Execution Systems Assessable: Experimental and Validation Approaches to Closing Research Gaps,"Cognitive ergonomics and the mental health of production workers have attracted increasing interest in industrial companies. However, there is still not much research available as it is regarding physical ergonomics and muscular load. This paper designs an experiment to analyze the cognitive ergonomics and mental stress of shop floor production workers interacting with different user interfaces of a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) that is adjustable for analyzing the influence of other assistive systems, too. This approach is going to be designed with the Design of Experiments (DoE) method. Therefore, the respective goals and factors are going to be determined. The environment will be the laboratories of the University of Applied Sciences Amberg-Weiden and its Campus for Digitalization in Amberg. In detail, there will be a sample assembly process from the automotive supplier industry for demonstration purposes. At this laboratory, the MES software from the European benchmark SAP is installed, and the respective standard Production Operator Desk is going to be used with slight adaptions. In order to make the cognitive ergonomics measurable, different approaches are going to be used.

Task reallocation of human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model,"As collaborative robots become more popular in industry, they are used to collaborate with human workers and free human workers from repeated and heavy work and reduce the risk of physical injuries. However, human workers need to finish tasks that require high cognitive abilities, which increases the risk of mental fatigue. Fatigue can negatively impact workers and even threaten the safety of workers. Currently, the dynamics of human fatigue model are rarely considered. Hence, it is crucial to develop a dynamic allocation method for human-robot collaborative tasks that considers dynamic human fatigue to ensure efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. This paper proposes a task reallocation method for human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model. A fatigue feature extraction method from multimodal data and a fatigue evaluation network are proposed to evaluate the current fatigue status of human workers. Based on the evaluation results, the human fatigue model is dynamically updated. If the worker's fatigue state changes, a task reallocation scheme is generated by an improved genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning and the dynamic human fatigue model. The experimental results show that the proposed model and algorithm are effective and efficient, and can provide innovative insights for realizing a human-centered manufacturing workshop. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Dynamic human fatigue model; Human-robot collaboration (HRC); Improved genetic algorithm; Reinforcement learning; Task reallocation,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2024,Conference,Yao B.; Li X.; Ji Z.; Xiao K.; Xu W.,10.1016/j.cie.2023.109855
Multimodal Learning-Based Proactive Human Handover Intention Prediction Using Wearable Data Gloves and Augmented Reality,"Efficient object handover between humans and robots holds significant importance within collaborative manufacturing environments. Enhancing the efficacy of human–robot handovers involves enabling robots to comprehend and foresee human handover intentions. This article introduces human-teaching–robot-learning-prediction framework, allowing robots to learn from diverse human demonstrations and anticipate human handover intentions. The framework facilitates human programming of robots through demonstrations utilizing augmented reality and a wearable dataglove, aligned with task requirements and human working preferences. Subsequently, robots enhance their cognitive capabilities by assimilating insights from human handover demonstrations, utilizing deep neural network algorithms. Furthermore, robots can proactively seek clarification from humans via an augmented reality system when confronted with ambiguity in human intentions, mirroring how humans seek clarity from their counterparts. This proactive approach empowers robots to anticipate human intentions and assist human partners during handovers. Empirical results underscore the benefits of the proposed approach, demonstrating highly accurate prediction of human intentions in human–robot handover tasks. © 2023 The Authors.

RHYTHMS: Real-time Data-driven Human-machine Synchronization for Proactive Ergonomic Risk Mitigation in the Context of Industry 4.0 and Beyond,"Human-machine work system (HMWS) represents a composite system that integrates machine precision and strength with human cognitive abilities, flexibility, and adaptability, aiming to achieve enhanced performance in various tasks aligned with a common goal, which is getting smarter in the era of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and has received extensive attention from academia and industry. However, the lack of real-time information sharing during HMWS implementation and operation, coupled with uncertainties stemming from human instability and the complexities introduced by smart networking environments in the context of I4.0, poses challenges to the synchronous coordination of this distributed human-centric manufacturing system. Failure in synchronization not only compromises overall system integrity, leading to unrealistic decision-making and potential harm to human health but also goes against the principles of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which proposes placing human well-being at the center of the production process for human-centric smart manufacturing in the future. In this context, this research presents real-time data-driven hyper objects orchestrating for the human-machine synchronization (RHYTHMS) based on a service-oriented human-to-machine architecture (SOH2M) and a model reference adaptive fuzzy control for real-time information sharing and synchronous coordination of the smart HMWS. Based on these, a real-life assembly case is carried out by a full-scale HMWS prototype to quantitatively analyze the benefits of the proposed approach in proactive ergonomic risk mitigation (PERM), contributing to the human-centric value-oriented I5.0 era. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Assembly Workstation 4.0; Ergonomics; Human-machine system; Industry 4.0; Industry 5.0; synchronization,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2024,Journal,Ling S.; Yuan Y.; Yan D.; Leng Y.; Rong Y.; Huang G.Q.,10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102709
"Unlocking Human-Robot Dynamics: Introducing SenseCobot, a Novel Multimodal Dataset on Industry 4.0","In the era of Industry 4.0, the importance of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the advancement of modern manufacturing and automation is paramount. Understanding the intricate physiological responses of the operator when they interact with a cobot is essential, especially during programming tasks. To this aim, wearable sensors have become vital for real-time monitoring of worker well-being, stress, and cognitive load.

HAR2bot: a human-centered augmented reality robot programming method with the awareness of cognitive load,"In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing enterprises are actively adopting collaborative robots (Cobots) in their productions. Current online and offline robot programming methods are difficult to use and require extensive experience or skills. On the other hand, the manufacturing industries are experiencing a labor shortage. An essential question, therefore, is: how would a new robot programming method help novice users complete complex tasks effectively, efficiently, and intuitively? To answer this question, we proposed HAR2bot, a novel human-centered augmented reality programming interface with awareness of cognitive load. Using NASA’s system design theory and the cognitive load theory, a set of guidelines for designing an AR-based human-robot interaction system is obtained through a human-centered design process. Based on these guidelines, we designed and implemented a human-in-the-loop workflow with features for cognitive load management. The effectiveness and efficiency of HAR2bot are verified in two complex tasks compared with existing online programming methods. We also evaluated HAR2bot quantitatively and qualitatively through a user study with 16 participants. According to the user study, compared with existing methods, HAR2bot has higher efficiency, a lower overall cognitive load, lower cognitive loads for each type, and higher safety. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Augmented reality; Cognitive load; Collaborative robot; Human–robot interaction,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,2024,Journal,Yang W.; Xiao Q.; Zhang Y.,10.1007/s10845-023-02096-2
Using Metrics For The Assessment of Human Interaction With Worker Assistance Systems,"Factories often include worker assistance systems to support assembly through cognitive guidance, connected tools and sensors. The benefits are improvements in productivity and quality. While the measurement and display of productivity and quality is widely spread, the underlying human interaction with worker assistance systems is not yet established to be assessed in key performance indicators. Those metrics are necessary to measure the level of human-centered design of assembly stations and worker assistance systems. The metrics are meant to yield detailed insights on the information perception of workers and the resulting work activities. Besides the discovery of needs for reconfiguration of worker assistance systems and assembly stations, the metrics can also be used as a basis for comparison to quantify differences between multiple setups. This paper investigates metrics for the assessment of human-centered assembly station design and worker assistance systems. Therefore, multiple categories of metrics on human-technology-interaction are derived from literature and contextualized for worker assistance systems. For validation, selected metrics are implemented at an industrial-grade assembly station for an electric motor replica in a learning factory. The findings in the validation allow the assessment of the information perception and the work activities regarding material picking, handling and ergonomics. © 2024, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

Large Language Model for Humanoid Cognition in Proactive Human-Robot Collaboration,"Proactive Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which aims to achieve mutual-cognitive, predictable, and self-organizing collaboration between multiple humans and robots, is crucial for today's human-centric smart manufacturing. To enable Proactive HRC, various methods have been explored, including deep neural networks for visual detection, scene graph for decision-making, and reinforcement learning for robot execution. However, these methods often require re-training with domain-specific datasets in different scenarios, lacking generalizability and transferability for diverse manufacturing activities. The advent of Large Language Model (LLM) technology offers a promising solution for comprehending diverse tasks, modelling human intentions, and planning robot operations using natural vision-language instructions. This ability closely resembles human intelligence, specifically humanoid cognition, which allows flexible knowledge acquisition of the surrounding environment and exerting physical influence on tasks. Therefore, this paper delves into the concept of humanoid cognition in Proactive HRC and evaluates relevant LLM methods from the perspectives of task explainability, human-centricity, and robot executability. Based on the testing results, the authors provide discussions and future prospects for successfully integrating LLM approaches into Proactive HRC in the manufacturing domain. © 2024 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering,2024,Conference,Li S.; Wang Z.; Yan Z.; Gao Y.; Jiang H.; Zheng P.,10.1109/CASE59546.2024.10711379

How to Decrease Negative Impressions towards Multiple Social Robots: A Preliminary Investigation,"Recently, research using multiple social robots has been actively conducted for advanced communication. Using multiple social robots has a positive effect of enhancing their influence. However, interacting with multiple robots may impose a cognitive load on people, potentially yielding negative impressions towards the social robots and adversely affecting human-robot interaction. In this study, we sought to decrease negative impressions in a scenario where participants could perceive the robot as a friend or family member. Specifically, we conducted a preliminary experiment using multiple robots, where a group of friends and family members participated, and investigated impressions towards multiple robots. The finding in this study revealed that approximately 70% of the participants had no negative impressions and more than 80% of the participants felt that 10 social robots had the most enhanced influence. This study provided interesting perspectives for the design of interactions aimed at enhancing the influence of multiple robots. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Interaction design; Multiple robots; Social robot,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,2024,Conference,Hatano Y.; Baba J.; Nakanishi J.; Yoshikawa Y.; Ishiguro H.,10.1145/3610978.3640639
Augmented reality guided autonomous assembly system: A novel framework for assembly sequence input validations and creation of virtual content for AR instructions development,"In recent years, industries are striving to adapt immersive technologies in the real-time assembly shop floor setting to achieve effective outcomes in terms of enabling the worker to handle the complex cognitive assembly task execution/training circumstances. The manufacturers are presently facing difficulties with the process of Augmented reality (AR) instruction creation for the required product assembly system. The existing AR instruction development process demands highly skilled experts and more time consumption. Hence, the manufacturers are presently relying on third parties to acquire the required AR instructions by providing the necessary assembly particulars as input. Where, the cost of developing AR instruction is another big challenging concern. Predominantly, the significance of providing exact assembly input is vital for the experts to develop the appropriate AR content without any errors. An automated approach is developed in this study to resolve the difficulties with assembly sequence input for the AR instructions development process. The automated approach affords four different provisions that include validation of an assembly sequence input prior to the AR instructions development stage, suggestions for assembly sequence input generation, simulation of validated assembly sequence in the Virtual reality (VR) environment for user perception, and generation of virtual content for AR visualizations. Subsequently, the generated digital contents from the automated approach are imparted into the AR Unity platform to develop the required AR instructions for the product assembly system. Notably, this study explores the AR customized marker technique to visualize the AR content in the user's view of the physical context. Finally, the AR guidelines are built as apps for the selected 11-part assembly and deployed on the shop floor for the user to perceive the AR content through visualization devices for execution of assembly operations in a real-time context. In addition, the effectiveness of the automated approach is analyzed with the existing approach, and the consequences are explored through the process of receiving feedback from the experts about the error rate, cognitive level, and creation time. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Assembly input validation; Assembly sequence; Assembly system; Augmented reality; Manufacturing system; Virtual reality; Virtual scene creation,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2024,Journal,Eswaran M.; Prasad V.S.S.V.; Hymavathi M.; Bahubalendruni M.V.A.R.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2023.11.002
Active YOLO for lobster part detection in industrial contexts,"The manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant transformation driven by digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) -based solutions. As manufacturers aim to boost productivity while maintaining human involvement, integrating robots poses new challenges. Emerging technologies like brain-machine interfaces and advanced AI are essential, leading to a new paradigm known as Industry 5.0 [1]. Industry 4.0 revolutionized manufacturing with AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cognitive computing, creating ""smart"" environments where interconnected machines autonomously optimize production. This shift has significantly increased productivity and performance. However, Industry 5.0 further evolves by emphasizing collaboration between humans and robots, leveraging human creativity and advanced machinery. It aims to enhance efficiency and enable mass personalization, where products are tailored to individual needs. The core value of Industry 5.0 is human centricity, with machines handling repetitive tasks and humans focusing on cognitive and critical thinking tasks [2]. On the one hand and according to [3], the key technologies supporting a human-centric AI in manufacturing include i) Active Learning (AL): AI systems continuously learn from human feedback, enhancing human-machine synergy; ii) Explainable AI (XAI): Ensures AI decisions are transparent and understandable, fostering trust and collaboration; iii) Simulated Reality: Uses virtual environments to simulate real-world scenarios for training and decision-making; iv) Conversational Interfaces: Enable natural language interactions between humans and machines, improving usability; v) Security: Ensures data and system security as digitalization increases the attack surface. On the other hand and within this transformation, object detection (OD) plays a crucial role [4] by applying it in different systems like defect detection for quality control, in collaborative robots (cobots), with robot arms for palletising and pick and place automated system, and in video surveillance systems. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning, that the most recent development of these systems is based on YOLO detectors for their precision and inference speed efficiency trade-off [5]. In eastern Canada, the lobster fishery industry is the most commercially important fishery in Atlantic Canada [6, 7]. Integrating cutting-edge techniques and technologies within New Brunswick lobster manufacturers is crucial to match the industrial development era. To this end, a large lobster parts detection dataset has been collected by the R.E.I.4.0 laboratory at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Moncton. It includes several thousand color and grayscale images of lobsters collected in a context simulating an industrial environment [8]. All collected images have been annotated into six classes: Tail, claw, head, body, force claw, and folded tail, with their corresponding bounding box coordinates. The dataset also contains images without the lobster or its parts appearing (background). Thus, we propose a new YOLO-based lobster part detection system by exploiting an AL approach. Considering a limited label budget, AL aims to select the most effective images to be annotated to improve the model efficiency by applying a selection-based metric for N cycles until the label budget is reached. While AL is an annotation cost optimization-based machine learning approach, it is still underexploited and applied in OD. Three main selection categories exist in the general literature: Those based on the informativeness of samples, representativeness, and hybrid approaches [9]. In this work, we first evaluate the uncertainty selection metric based on entropy with the latest YOLO series update, i.e. YOLOv10 [10]. This detector presents the best holistic inference speed-accuracy performance for real-time detection. The initial active YOLOv10 training cycle used 0.5% randomly selected annotated data; then, 4 active cycles were carried out with an increment of 0.5%. The label quota budget is 2.5%, representing about 500 annotated images from the training dataset. For evaluation, we used a noisy version of the test set, simulating adverse industrial environment conditions, such as the addition of blur, and textures simulating the effect of water on images, reflections, and more severe intensity variations compared to the original images. The preliminary mAP50 result of active YOLOv10 compared to YOLOv10 trained from scratch and fine-tuned from the COCO trained model, when using a 2.5% random annotated image, are very competitive with 0.778, 0.802, and 0.831, respectively. Indeed, the entropy calculation only considers the prediction score. However, the consistency and reliability of the predicted bounding boxes should also be considered in the strategy applied to object detection systems. This is the primary objective of our ongoing experiments. © 2024, Avestia Publishing.

Comparison of concurrent cognitive load measures during n-back tasks,"The cognitive load experienced by humans is an important factor affecting their performance. Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Cognitive load; Detection response task; Eye-tracking; Human-computer interface; Pupil diameter,Applied Ergonomics,2024,Journal,Pillai P.; Balasingam B.; Jaekel A.; Biondi F.N.,10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104244
The effects of representation of industrial icons on visual search performance,"With innovations in intelligent manufacturing technology and the enhancement of intelligent manufacturing systems, the quantity of information held and transmitted by interactive interfaces has increased significantly, which also increases the cognitive load on the operators. As a component of an interactive interface, the icon has the vital mission of communicating semantics. The eye-movement experiments were conducted to research the effects of visual representations of industrial icons on search performance. The results show that the visual search performance is optimal for negative polarity icons with the line width of 1.0px and the figure/background area ratio of 50%. Furthermore, we concluded the visual search strategy of operator for industrial icons on the basis of analysis for pictorial icons and multi-semantic icons with eye movement data. This study takes the visual representation of industrial icons as perspective on design evaluation and optimization. The cognitive load on the operator can be minimized and the interface information can be accessed quickly and accurately by following our icon design recommendation. It is significant to improve the efficiency of manufacturing operation and ensure the safety of the manufacturing process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Industrial icons; Intelligent manufacturing; Representation; Visual search performance; Visual search strategy,Displays,2024,Journal,Shao J.; Zhan Y.; Zhu H.; Zhang M.; Qin L.; Tian S.; Qi H.,10.1016/j.displa.2024.102661
Visual analytics for digital twins: a conceptual framework and case study,"The new generation of intelligent manufacturing systems requires a deep integration of human-cyber-physical spaces. Visual analytics plays a critical role in effectively navigating humans through twin data, enabling them to make better decisions and discover new knowledge, contributing to the evolution of digital twins. However, due to the lack of study of visual analytics components and their inter-relations in the context of the digital twin, the visual analytic process of digital twin systems lacks guidance to fully integrate human domain experience and cognitive abilities into the intelligent decision-making process of digital twin systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a conceptual visual analytics framework for digital twins (DTVA). Moreover, from the perspective of data and models in digital twins, the works concerning key factors of visual analytics, including digital-twin visual representation (DTV), analytical reasoning (DTA), and human–machine interface (DTI), are analyzed from data flow, task flow, and visual flow. At last, a case study of DTVA-based anomaly detection, which focuses on the abnormality detection of crane operation status, is presented.

Multi-sensor fusion based industrial action recognition method under the environment of intelligent manufacturing,"In the context of intelligent manufacturing and Industry 4.0, the manufacturing industry is rapidly transitioning toward mass personalization production. Despite this trend, the assembly industry still relies on manual operations performed by workers, considering their cognitive ability and flexibility. Thereinto, studying operator action perception and recognition methods is a vital filed and of great significance for improving the production efficiency and ensuring product quality.

To address this, an AR guidance system was developed for a head-mounted display device, utilizing image, object, and gesture recognition to minimize user interaction and enhance system adaptiveness, ultimately reducing cognitive load. A user study employing video observations and questionnaires was conducted to evaluate the AR system's impact on usability and cognitive load. Results indicate that the prototype effectively facilitated tool change tasks, providing a user-friendly experience with reduced cognitive load. The integration of image, object, and gesture recognition contributed to streamlined user guidance, minimizing the need for constant user interventions.

Why not work with anthropomorphic collaborative robots? The mediation effect of perceived intelligence and the moderation effect of self-efficacy,"Collaborative robots (cobots) are an essential component of intelligent manufacturing. However, employees working alongside them have negative attitudes toward cobots that assist humans' work. To address this industrial human–robot interaction problem, this study adopted the idea of cognitive ergonomics research, invited 323 participants, and conducted an empirical study using an experimental vignette methodology. This study found that (1) perceived intelligence plays a mediating role in the relationship between cobots anthropomorphism and negative attitudes toward cobots; (2) perceived intelligence and perceived threat play a serial mediating role in the relationship between cobots anthropomorphism and negative attitudes toward cobots; (3) robot use self-efficacy plays a moderating role in the relationship between perceived threat and negative attitudes toward cobots.

Development and comparison studies of XR interfaces for path definition in remote welding scenarios,"The recent pandemic and associated hybrid work culture reignites the importance of extended reality (XR) technologies for remote collaboration across the world. As different ranges of automation are introduced in the industry with an increasing focus on digitalization, safety, and productivity, it is important to understand the context and physiological metrics of existing human operators. This paper describes the implementation of a virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) interface of a welding process and compares operators' performance using such technologies. Initially, MR and VR were compared with respect to a pointing task followed by a welding task involving trajectory definition and actual robotic arm movement. A plethora of parameters involving ocular data, Electroencephalography (EEG), hand movement, subjective opinion and quantitative measures were recorded and analyzed. The results of physiological parameters such as EEG based Task Load Index, Task Engagement Index, ocular fixation rate and average fixation duration indicated that the VR interaction involved higher levels of engagement, lower mental processing load and distinct visual processing mechanisms in the optical cortex compared to the MR interaction. Similar comparison trends observed in these parameters across both tasks confirmed the reproducibility of the experiment methodology and results. Results from the study can be used in terms of selecting rendering media for other immersive applications such as teleoperation, path planning and navigation scenarios in multiple domains such as manufacturing, robotics, healthcare, and education. The results were used to develop a multi-modal VR interface with a novel collision-based weld path definition method suitable for industrial deployment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",Cognitive workload; Mixed reality; Remote telerobotic welding; User performance; Virtual reality,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2024,Journal,Rao M.C.A.; Raj S.; Shah A.K.; Harshitha B.R.; Talawar N.R.; Sharma V.K.; Sanjana M.; Vishwakarma H.; Biswas P.,10.1007/s11042-023-17604-y
Investigating the effect of intelligent assistance systems on motivational work characteristics in assembly,"Intelligent assistance systems (IAS) are designed to counteract rising cognitive demands caused by increasingly individualized manufacturing processes in assembly. How IAS affect work characteristics which are crucial for promoting work motivation of employees is yet unclear. Based on the cyber-physical systems transformation framework, the model of routine-biased technological change, and a comprehensive model of work design, we expected in- and decreases in motivational work characteristics (MWC) when working with IAS. Furthermore, we posited a buffering effect of the option of voluntary use on decreasing knowledge characteristics. Applying an online case study with experimental vignette methodology (EVM) allowed us to identify effects of the IAS on MWC before it is widely implemented. 203 German and British blue-collar workers evaluated an assembly workplace according to three experimental conditions (work without IAS, work with IAS, work with voluntary use of IAS). We identified enhanced feedback from the job and information processing in work with IAS in contrast to a traditional assembly workplace but found no restrictions (or elevations) in terms of other task (i.e., autonomy) or knowledge characteristics (i.e., job complexity, problem solving, specialization, skill variety). Thus, our results indicate that the IAS improves some motivational work characteristics of the assembly workplace, although it misses the primary goal of cognitive relief. Our study highlights the need for work design theories that specify the effect of IAS on motivational work characteristics and the potential benefit of IAS in assembly of the future. © The Author(s) 2023.",Assembly; Intelligent assistance systems; Motivational work characteristics; Voluntary use; Work design,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,2024,Journal,Walczok M.; Bipp T.,10.1007/s10845-023-02086-4
Investigating Whether the Mass of a Tool Replica Influences Virtual Training Learning Outcomes,"Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a promising solution to address the pressing concern of transferring know-how in the manufacturing industry. Making an immersive training experience often involves designing an instrumented replica of a tool whose use is to be learned through virtual training. The process of making a replica can alter its mass, making it different from that of the original tool. As far as we know, the influence of this difference on learning outcomes has never been evaluated. To investigate this subject, an immersive training experience was designed with pre and post-training phases under real conditions, dedicated to learning the use of a rotary tool. 80 participants took part in this study, split into three groups: a control group performing the virtual training using a replica with the same mass as the original tool ($\mathrm{m}=100\%$), a second group that used a replica with a lighter mass than the original tool ($\mathrm{m}= 50\%$) and a third group using a replica heavier than the original tool ($\mathrm{m}=150\%$). Despite variations in the mass of the replica used for training, this study revealed that the learning outcomes remained comparable across all groups, while also demonstrating significant enhancements in certain performance measures, including task completion time. Overall, these findings provide useful insights regarding the design of tool replicas for immersive training. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",Prop Design; User Study; Virtual Reality; Virtual Training; Weight Perception,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2024,Journal,Cauquis J.; Peillard E.; Dominjon L.; Duval T.; Moreau G.,10.1109/TVCG.2024.3372041
Response Preparation Affects Cognitive Motor Control,"Objective: We investigated how the ability to control whether or not to inhibit an action is affected by the response preparation. Background: The ability to control actions is a central skill to properly behave in complex environments. Increased levels of response preparation are associated with reduced response times, but how they directly affect the ability to control actions is not well explored. We investigated how the response preparation affects the ability to control the generation of actions in the context of a stop selective task. Method: Participants performed a visuo-motor stop selective task. Results: We found that an increased level of response preparation reduced the ability to control actions. In the condition with high preparation, we observed shorter response times and increased probability of wrong responses to a request to stop, compared to a condition with a lower level of preparation. Conclusion: We demonstrated that high response preparation hinders action control. Application: Understanding the cognitive factors that affect the ability to properly control actions is crucial to develop devices that can be exploited in different contexts such as the aviation, industrial, and military. We demonstrated that subjects’ response preparation is a key factor influencing their ability to flexibly control their reaction to different stimuli. This study offers a suitable paradigm that can be used to investigate which system features in a controlled task promote an optimal balance between response speed and error rate. © 2022, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",control process; decision making; motor control; perceptual-motor performance; response time,Human Factors,2024,Journal,Andujar M.; Marc I.B.; Giuffrida V.; Ferraina S.; Brunamonti E.; Pani P.,10.1177/00187208221132749
Exploring Cognition and Affect during Human-Cobot Interaction,"This work addresses the challenge of understanding and responding to variations in human cognitive and emotional states during Human-Robot Interaction in manufacturing settings. We investigate the use of consumer-grade EEG devices to gather the operator's brain signals and infer their emotional and cognitive states. These states are then communicated to the robot. A Raspberry Pi-controlled robotic arm, programmed with an adaptive algorithm, allows it to react in real-time to changes in the operator's stress and concentration levels. Aiming to facilitate smoother interactions, the robot dynamically adjusts its motor speed according to the operator's concentration and stress levels. Additionally, it uses RGB lighting to notify the operator when stress levels increase above a predefined threshold, suggesting a break to maintain optimal well-being. This exploration paves the way for delving into more complex scenarios involving multiple users and robots collaborating simultaneously. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",Affect; Affective-Driven; BCI; Cobot; Cognition; Collaborative Robots; EEG; Self-Adaptation,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,2024,Conference,Canete A.; Gonzalez-Sanchez J.; Guerra-Silva R.,10.1145/3610978.3641082
UX-Driven Methodology to Design Usable Augmented Reality Applications for Maintenance,"In recent decades industrial development has led to increasingly sophisticated machinery and systems, which require complex maintenance routines. Consequently, maintenance operators may not have the sufficient skills to perform recovery procedures properly and quickly, so that the need of assistance from the manufacturer's after-sales service or companies specialized in maintenance services. Such actions usually lead to very long recovery times, high maintenance costs, and a temporary drop in production. In this scenario, we should consider that Industry 4.0 is making available innovative technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), suitable for improving the skills and competencies of operators without burdening their cognitive load, and consequently wellbeing. However, technologies must be selected, designed, and used according to the users' needs to be effective and useful. The paper presents a user experience (UX)-driven methodology for designing user-centric AR applications for complex maintenance procedures. The methodology was applied to a real industrial case concerning the management of CNC machines in a plant producing tractors components, where a smartphone-based AR application was designed and tested with users. The satisfactory results highlighted the potential benefits of AR in industry and specifically in maintenance.  © 2023 The Authors.",Augmented Reality; Industry 4.0; Maintenance; Operator 4.0; User experience design,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2023,Conference,Valentini L.; Grandi F.; Peruzzini M.; Pellicciari M.,10.3233/ATDE230596
Effect of Changes in the Sequence of Assembly Operations on Error Rates: A Case Study from the Car Manufacturing Industry,"Human operator-induced assembly errors affect the quality of car manufacturing. Understanding the factors influencing assembly errors is critical for quality improvement. The sequence of assembly operations, a factor markedly affecting cognitive load, remains largely understudied. We aimed to assess the effect of changing the sequence of assembly operations on error rates through four field experiments conducted in a car manufacturing plant. The parts (and errors) under study were child lock labels (missing labels), sunroofs (missing bolts), windshield wiper arms (loose bolts), and armrests (wrong selection). Parts were chosen based on data from quality records, and they represent different scenarios regarding the sequencing of assembly operations. Minitab was used to conduct the statistical test for two proportions at a significance level of 0.05. The experiments ran for a period varying from 9 to 25 weeks (22292 to 138456 cars). All four experiments exhibited significant differences in the proportion of errors. MODAPTS cycle-time calculations revealed no negative effect of assembly sequence variations on productivity. The study findings show that changing the assembly operation sequence can reduce the error rates, possibly due to the intermediary effect in reducing the operator's cognitive load. Overall, realizing quality improvement requires optimizing the assembly operation sequence in terms of time and productivity while considering its possible impact on error rates.  © 2013 IEEE.",Assembly systems; automobile manufacture; cognitive load; human factors; quality control,IEEE Access,2024,Journal,Real C.; Torres Y.,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3371980
Robot Trajectron: Trajectory Prediction-based Shared Control for Robot Manipulation,"We address the problem of (a) predicting the trajectory of an arm reaching motion, based on a few seconds of the motion's onset, and (b) leveraging this predictor to facilitate shared-control manipulation tasks, by reducing the operator's cognitive load through assistance in their anticipated direction of motion. Our novel intent estimator, dubbed the Robot Trajectron (RT), produces a probabilistic representation of the robot's anticipated trajectory based on its recent position, velocity and acceleration history. By taking arm dynamics into account, RT can capture the operator's intent better than other SOTA models that only use the arm's position, making it particularly well-suited to assist in tasks where the operator's intent is susceptible to change. We derive a novel shared-control solution that combines RT's predictive capacity to a representation of the locations of potential reaching targets. Our experiments demonstrate RT's effectiveness in both intent estimation and shared-control tasks. We will make the code and data supporting our experiments publicly available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/detry-lab/public/robot-trajectron © 2024 IEEE.",,Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation,2024,Conference,Song P.; Li P.; Aertbelien E.; Detry R.,10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611507
Development of a Neuroergonomic Assessment for the Evaluation of Mental Workload in an Industrial Human–Robot Interaction Assembly Task: A Comparative Case Study,"The disruptive deployment of collaborative robots, named cobots, in Industry 5.0 has brought attention to the safety and ergonomic aspects of industrial human–robot interaction (HRI) tasks. In particular, the study of the operator’s mental workload in HRI activities has been the research object of a new branch of ergonomics, called neuroergonomics, to improve the operator’s wellbeing and the efficiency of the system. This study shows the development of a combinative assessment for the evaluation of mental workload in a comparative analysis of two assembly task scenarios, without and with robot interaction. The evaluation of mental workload is achieved through a combination of subjective (NASA TLX) and real-time objective measurements. This latter measurement is found using an innovative electroencephalogram (EEG) device and the characterization of the cognitive workload through the brainwave power ratio β/α, defined after the pre-processing phase of EEG data. Finally, observational analyses are considered regarding the task performance of the two scenarios. The statistical analyses show how significantly the mental workload diminution and a higher level of performance, as the number of components assembled correctly by the participants, are achieved in the scenario with the robot. © 2023 by the authors.",cobots; collaborative robotics; EEG; ergonomic assessment; experimental design; human–robot interaction; IR5.0; mental workload; neuroergonomics; performance,Machines,2023,Journal,Caiazzo C.; Savkovic M.; Pusica M.; Milojevic D.; Leva M.C.; Djapan M.,10.3390/machines11110995
"Multimodal Assessment of Cognitive Workload Using Neural, Subjective and Behavioural Measures in Smart Factory Settings","Collaborative robots (cobots) have largely replaced conventional industrial robots in today's workplaces, particularly in manufacturing setups, due to their improved performance and intelligent design. In the framework of Industry 5.0, humans are working alongside cobots to accomplish the required level of automation. However, human-robot interaction has brought up concerns regarding human factors (HF) and ergonomics. A human worker may experience cognitive stress as a result of cobots' irresponsive nature in unpredictably occurring situations, which adversely affects productivity. Therefore, there is a necessity to measure stress to enhance a human worker's performance in a human-robot collaborative environment. In this study, factory workers' mental workload was assessed using physiological, behavioural, and subjective measures. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were collected to acquire brain signals and track hemodynamic activity, respectively. The effect of task complexity, cobot movement speed, and cobot payload capacity on the mental stress of a human worker were observed for a task designed in the context of a smart factory. Task complexity and cobot speed proved to be more impactful. As physiological measures are unbiased and more authentic means to estimate stress, eventually they may replace the other conventional measures if they prove to correlate with the results of traditional ones. Here, regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were utilised to determine the correlation between physiological data and subjective and behavioural measures. Regression performed better for most of the targets and the best correlation (rsq-adj = 0.654146) was achieved for predicting missed beeps, a behavioural measure, using a combination of multiple EEG and fNIRS predictors. The k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm was used to evaluate the accuracy of correlation between traditional measures and physiological variables, with the highest accuracy of 77.8% achieved for missed beeps as the target. Results show that physiological measures can be more insightful and have the tendency to replace other biased parameters.",cognitive stress analysis; EEG; fNIRS; human robot collaboration (HRC); machine learning; neuroimaging,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Journal,Zakeri Z.; Arif A.; Omurtag A.; Breedon P.; Khalid A.,10.3390/s23218926
Supporting human supervision in autonomous collision avoidance through agent transparency,"Ongoing trends in society point towards the adoption of intelligent agents across safety critical industries. In the maritime domain, artificially intelligent agents may soon be capable of autonomously performing collision and grounding avoidance (CAGA); a task traditionally performed by humans. Consequently, the role of humans is anticipated to change from those performing collision avoidance to those supervising an agent performing collision avoidance. One of the key concerns with regards to human factors is avoiding the out-of-the-loop performance problem where humans lose situation awareness (SA) and become susceptible to misinterpreting the agent's decisions and planned actions. Despite previous research addressing human factors in autonomous shipping and remote control, few studies have focused on how to support the humans’ mental processes in this new role. Therefore, this study performed a goal-directed task analysis addressing goals, decisions, and SA requirements for human-supervised collision avoidance. Data was obtained from in situ observations and interviews with nine navigators onboard passenger ferries, an appraisal of the collision regulations, and of relevant company documentation. The task analysis identified specific SA requirements to make agents, capable of collision and grounding avoidance, transparent to their users. The results further indicate a change towards increased cognitive activities required to verify agent performance. Therefore, providing insight into the agents’ internal reasoning and actions becomes a key consideration in supporting future supervisors. Given the trends towards the application of artificially intelligent agents capable of autonomous behaviour, this study anticipates that transparency becomes an essential prerequisite for safe and effective human-autonomy system oversight. © 2023 The Author(s)",Autonomous agents; Autonomous shipping; Cognitive task analysis; Collision avoidance; Goal-directed task analysis; Human-Machine Interaction; Safety; Situation Awareness; Transparency,Safety Science,2024,Journal,van de Merwe K.; Mallam S.; Nazir S.; Engelhardtsen Ø.,10.1016/j.ssci.2023.106329
Evaluating the Efficiency of Voice Control as Human Machine Interface in Production,"Cars, mobile phones, and smart home devices already provide automatic speech recognition (ASR) by default. However, human machine interfaces (HMI) in industrial settings, as opposed to consumer settings, operate under different conditions and thus, present different design challenges. Voice control, arguably the most natural form of communication, has the potential to shorten complex command sequences and menu structures in order to directly execute a final command. Therefore, this contribution explored how differing HMI scenarios could possibly be optimized, by either replacing or complementing existing touch control interactions with voice control. Typical commands from CNC milling machines and industrial robots were categorized by their complexity, quantified by menu level and the necessary number of interactions. The collected interaction data showed that voice control can already provide a time efficiency advantage at either one additional menu level or three touchscreen interactions. For complex commands, such as those needing five menu levels and seven interactions on the touchscreen, the time efficiency advantage of voice control can reach up to 67 %. Furthermore, the study shows the possibility of reducing machine operator training times when using voice control by significantly lower interaction times for the first repetition of the participants. Note to Practitioners - Several publications investigate the ergonomics, usability, and cognitive load of classic mouse and keyboard control, button control, touch control, gesture control, gaze control, or voice control in specific interaction scenarios. All publications state that these factors need to be considered for the development of modern human machine interfaces (HMI). Due by the complexity of these factors, it is difficult to develop general guidelines to build efficient HMIs independent from the machine or process. A lack of efficiency guidelines potentially hampers the development of new HMIs, currently necessary to address the new challenges in the digital production hall like increasingly complex machines, processes that become more individual as well as multiple machine operation. In order to inform HMI development, voice and touch control alternatives were empirically measured. Based on the collected data complexity time equivalents for each menu level and number of interactions were calculated. These time equivalents provide the opportunity for machine and programmable logic controller (PLC) manufacturers to evaluate their production processes and the related interaction processes regarding the potential efficiency benefits of voice control as a complement or substitute for the conventional HMI system. Using this model, the efficiency advantage of voice control can be estimated without implementing and testing a voice control on a real production machine. Thus, the potential benefit of implementing voice control can be assessed directly, avoiding expensive test runs.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Automatic speech recognition (ASR); human-computer interaction; human-robot interaction; machine control; machinery production industries; man-machine systems; optimized production technology; productivity; robot control; robust control; user interfaces,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024,Journal,Norda M.; Engel C.; Rennies J.; Appell J.-E.; Lange S.C.; Hahn A.,10.1109/TASE.2023.3302951
Reinvestigation of the Psychological Mechanisms of Construction Experience on Hazard Recognition Performance,"Objective: The study aimed to reinvestigate psychological mechanisms of the influence of construction workers’ experience on hazard recognition performance, with signal detection theory (SDT) and electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Background: Existing evidence regarding the effect of experience on hazard recognition performance in the construction industry remains inconsistent. Behavior-wise, identification of dominant hazard recognition factors (sensitivity or response bias, or both) would help determine appropriate training strategies to improve hazard recognition. In terms of neuro-responses, induced gamma-band activity was expected to reflect the cognitive functions mediating the psychological effects of experience. Method: Seventy-seven construction workers participated in a predesigned hazard recognition task, in which participants judged whether a hazard was present from a series of construction scenario pictures. We computed and compared the sensitivity and response bias of SDT and time-frequency representations of recorded EEG signals of the two experience-level groups. Results: Novice workers had higher hazard recognition rates. Behavior-wise, novices were more sensitive than more experienced workers. Compared with experienced workers, novices showed stronger gamma-band difference power (hazardous minus safe) in the left frontal and right posterior parietal areas during the hazard recognition process. Conclusion: Novices performed better at hazard recognition, indicating their sensitivity to the hazards without a clear difference in response bias. Based on the EEG data, novices’ sensitivity may be attributed to more efficient working memory and attentional control. Application: There is a need for continuous refreshment of hazard recognition skills for experienced workers for safety interventions. © 2022, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",construction industry; hazard recognition; neural oscillation; signal detection theory; work experience,Human Factors,2024,Journal,Zhou X.; Liao P.-C.; Xu Q.,10.1177/00187208211066666
Visual Encoding Method for MR Interface Operation Process Prompts Supporting Blind Area Assembly,"Recently, research on the accuracy of visual cues in human-machine interface prompts within industrial settings remains insufficient, particularly when dealing with manual assembly tasks that face multiple physical obstructions and limited visibility. Centering on the two dimensions of visual element layout and visual spatial depth, the blind zone visual information coding model is constructed to reveal the real-time occlusion relationship between manual operational gestures and the objectives of tasks within blind zones. Leveraging the principle of '3D image geometric transformation', this model adeptly translates intricate three-dimensional information onto a more manageable two-dimensional plane to reveal the real-time occlusion relationship between manual operational gestures and the objectives of tasks within blind zones. Through a case study experiment, the proposed visual encoding method was shown to effectively reduce the dispersion of operators' attention during assembly tasks in blind zones, compared to traditional assembly setups and visual encoding groups with digital mirror scenes. It can improve efficiency and accuracy in operators' assembly tasks in blind zones and reduce the cognitive load in understanding the intent of these tasks. Furthermore, in the aspect of enhancing user performance, the alignment of dynamic guiding cues with the intuitiveness of cognitive operations and the effectiveness of the cognitive framework of the MR interface presented within the operator's field of view are identified as two pivotal controllable factors for elevating user performance. The findings hold significant implications for guiding research in this direction. © 2024 IEEE.",Blind zone; Manual assembly; Mixed reality; Visual encoding,"2024 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Control, Electronics and Computer Technology, ICCECT 2024",2024,Conference,Wang Z.; Zhou Y.; Xiong F.; Xiao J.; Lu R.; Han F.,10.1109/ICCECT60629.2024.10546058
Inclusive manufacturing: A contribution to assembly processes with human-machine reciprocal learning,"This study explores the potential synergy between neurodiversity and advanced technology within Industry 5.0, focusing on the integration of neurodiverse individuals in the workforce through Human-Machine Collaboration and Reciprocal Learning (RL).

Studying the Effects of Back-Support Exoskeletons on Workers' Cognitive Load during Material Handling Tasks,"Exoskeletons, also known as wearable robots, are being studied as a potential solution to reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in construction. The exoskeletons can help enhance workers' postures and provide lift support, reducing the muscular demands on workers while executing construction tasks. Despite the potential of exoskeletons in reducing the risk of WMSDs, there is a lack of understanding about the potential effects of exoskeletons on workers' psychological states. This lack of knowledge raises concerns that exoskeletons may lead to psychological risks, such as cognitive overload, among workers. To bridge this gap, this study aims to assess the impact of back-support exoskeletons (BSE) on workers' cognitive load during material lifting tasks. To accomplish this, a physiologically based cognitive load assessment framework was developed. This framework used wearable biosensors to capture the physiological signals of workers and applied Autoencoder and Ensemble Learning techniques to train a machine learning classifier based on the signals to estimate cognitive load levels of workers while wearing the exoskeleton. Results showed that using BSE increased workers' cognitive load by 33% compared to not using it during material handling tasks. The findings can aid in the design and implementation of exoskeletons in the construction industry. © 2024 ASCE.",,"Construction Research Congress 2024, CRC 2024",2024,Conference,Liu Y.; Gautam Y.; Ojha A.; Shayesteh S.; Jebelli H.,10.1061/9780784485262.067
A real-time interactive decision-making and control framework for complex cyber-physical-human systems,"Over the past decade, the advancement of digital technology has significantly enhanced operations management in complex cyber-physical systems (CPSs), especially in the production and manufacturing sectors. In such systems, the physical and cyber spaces are generally connected through sensors, networking, and control actions. With the surge in available real-time data, automation and intelligence have become increasingly prevalent. However, full automation and sophisticated intelligence often remain challenging to achieve in real-world CPSs. Currently, many practical tasks in CPSs are best tackled through the integration of human cognitive skills with autonomous systems, highlighting the indispensable role that humans play in these settings. In this study, we present a framework for real-time decision-making and control in complex cyber-physical-human systems. The framework consists of three main modules: intelligent data processing, intelligent decision-making and control, and human-computer interaction. It is designed to provide a practical and implementable framework for supporting real-time decision-making and control in cyber-physical-human system applications. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we build a comprehensive decision support tool to manage several important real-time decision-making and control tasks at a container terminal. The tool is seamlessly integrated into the main operating system of the container terminal and aids decision-makers in making optimal decisions and generating appropriate control actions. The effectiveness of the tool is confirmed by observed improvements in several key operational efficiency indicators at the container terminal. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Cyber-physical-human systems; Decision-making; Human-computer interaction; Human-in-the-loop; Real-time control,Annual Reviews in Control,2024,Journal,Hu C.-L.; Wang L.; Chen M.-L.; Pei C.,10.1016/j.arcontrol.2024.100938
Extension of HAAS for the Management of Cognitive Load,"The rapid advancement of technology related to Industry 4.0 has brought about a paradigm shift in the way we interact with assets across various domains. This progress has led to the emergence of the concept of a Human Digital Twin (HDT), a virtual representation of an individual's cognitive, psychological, and behavioral characteristics. The HDT has demonstrated potential as a strategic tool for enhancing productivity, safety, and collaboration within the framework of Industry 5.0. In response to this challenge, this paper outlines a process for tracking human cognitive load using the galvanic skin response as a physiological marker and proposes a novel method for managing cognitive load based on the extended Human Asset Administration Shell (HAAS). The proposed HAAS framework integrates real-time data streams from wearable sensors, user skills, contextual information, task specifics, and environmental and surrounding conditions to deliver a comprehensive understanding of an individual's cognitive state, physical wellness, and skill set. Through the incorporation of skills set, physical, physiological, and psychological variables, and task parameters, the developed HAAS framework enables the identification, management, and development of individual capabilities, thereby facilitating individualized training and knowledge exchange. The applicability of the developed framework is proved by an experiments in the Operator 4.0 laboratory with the detailed HAAS parameters.  © 2013 IEEE.",Cognitive load; GSR; human asset administration shell,IEEE Access,2024,Journal,Eesee A.K.; Jasko S.; Eigner G.; Abonyi J.; Ruppert T.,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3359902
Leveraging Cognitive Conflict and Organizational Unlearning for Digital Mastery in SMEs: Insights from Upper Echelons,"In the rapidly evolving digital economy, digital transformation has emerged as a crucial strategy for firms to navigate market crises and improve operational efficiency. However, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face significant resource and capability constraints in their digital transformation efforts, presenting unique challenges compared with larger corporations. In this article, we focus on Chinese manufacturing SMEs, integrating upper echelons and dynamic capability theories to explore how top management team (TMT) cognitive conflict influences digital transformation competency (DTC) through organizational unlearning. The study also examines the moderating roles of CEO agile leadership and strategic consensus. An empirical analysis of 139 manufacturing SMEs over one year reveals that TMT cognitive conflict positively impacts DTC and promotes organizational unlearning. Furthermore, organizational unlearning mediates the relationship between TMT cognitive conflict and DTC. The findings also indicate that strategic consensus and CEO agile leadership positively moderate the effect of cognitive conflict on organizational unlearning.

Towards Operator Digital Twins in Industry 5.0: Design Strategies & Experimental Evaluation,"The concept of Industry 5.0 is set to revolutionize the landscape of modern manufacturing, emphasizing human-centricity and elevating the well-being of industry workers as a central tenet of the production process. This paper extends this vision by integrating the dimension of health, focusing not only on the well-being of the operator but also on the detection of their health condition, predicting potential issues, and consequently enhancing their overall welfare. Building upon this enhanced perspective, our work explores the role of Operator Digital Twins (ODTs), which are instrumental in creating a symbiotic relationship between human operators and industrial machinery. ODTs act as digital counterparts, reflecting the physical and cognitive states of operators, thus facilitating real-time monitoring of their capabilities, workload, stress levels, and various health-related parameters.

Inclusive manufacturing through the application of lean tools to sustainability issues,"Lean Thinking is a management philosophy that focuses on reducing waste and enhancing customer value. This study applies the concept of Lean Thinking to confront sustainability challenges in manufacturing companies, particularly with regards to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the Agenda 2030 that aim to integrate people with disabilities. Some commonly used and less frequently used tools, including the Ishikawa Diagram, Value Stream Mapping, and Cognitive Maps, were revised to mitigate the risks posed to the inclusion, full utilization, and well-being of workers. The findings indicate that adopting a lean thinking approach can facilitate the inclusive design of new production processes and enhance the efficiency of current operations, promoting social sustainability. The study identified certain challenges and drawbacks associated with applying Lean Thinking to sustainability concerns, including the necessity for stakeholder involvement, organizational cultural transformations, and steadfast devotion.

Remarks from an experimental study on human-robot collaborative assembly,"Human robot collaboration is becoming the norm in the workplace, due to the benefits robots can bring to efficiency and production. However, this creates highly complex and dynamic workplaces that human operators need to adapt to. Industry 5.0 promotes the use of robotics and smart technologies in a more human-centric way. However, research on how operators are affected by those changes is needed to better understand how to move towards human-centricity. As such, an experimental study was designed and performed on human robot collaborative assembly. The main aim was to investigate the correlation between cognitive load and quality due to collaboration. Here, the preliminary results of the experimental study are presented in order to remark relevant states influencing work allocation. The results showcased the need for better training and more knowledge for the operators, as well as involving operators in process and workplace design. This study helps contribute knowledge on robot implementation and process design for human robot collaboration for both researchers and operations management, as it showcases the need to involve operators in those steps due to the feedback they can provide due to their experience. © 2024 The Authors.

Multi-assistance systems in manufacturing - a user study evaluating multi-criteria impact in a high-mix low-volume assembly setting,"Understanding how skilled workers interact with assistance systems in manufacturing and how they experience the factory environment is fundamental to modeling human interaction and optimizing the processes correctly. This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners’ evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multi-criteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human–machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems. © 2023 The Author(s)",Assistance systems; Human factors; Manufacturing; Multi-criteria evaluation; User study,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023,Journal,Zigart T.; Zafari S.; Stürzl F.; Kiesewetter R.; Kasparick H.-P.; Schlund S.,10.1016/j.cie.2023.109674
Issues and Research Fields of Medical Robotics: A Review,"The goal for collaborative robots has always driven advancements in robotic technology, especially in the manufacturing sector. However, this is not the case in service sectors, especially in the health sector. Thus, this lack of focus has now opened more room for the design and development of service robots that can be used in the health sector to help patients with ailments, cognitive problems, and disabilities. There is currently a global effort towards the development of new products and the use of robotic medical devices and computer-assisted systems. However, the major problem has been the lack of a thorough and systematic review of robotic research into disease and epidemiology, especially from a technology perspective. Also, medical robots are increasingly being used in healthcare to perform a variety of functions that improve patient care. This scoping review is aimed at discovering the types of robots used in healthcare and where they are deployed. Moreover, the current study is an overview of various forms of robotic technology and its uses the healthcare industry. The considered technologies are the products of a partnership between the healthcare sector and academia. They demonstrate the research and testing that are necessary for the service of robot development before they can be employed in practical applications and service scenarios.

Human-robot collaboration assembly personalised safety detection method based on digital twin,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in assembly is becoming increasingly popular in the field of intelligent manufacturing. However, safety concerns remain the most critical issue to be addressed. The complex assembly environment and the individual differences of workers make it challenging to ensure safety effectively. Furthermore, the concept of human-centric manufacturing also places higher requirements on safety and efficiency of HRC assembly. The application of digital twin (DT) technology has bolstered the cognitive and decision-making capabilities in the context of HRC assembly. This technological advancement provides essential support for addressing safety concerns in HRC assembly processes guided by a human-centric approach. A personalised safety detection method for HRC assembly based on DT technology is proposed. This approach involves personalised modelling and simulation of real objects within the HRC process, establishing a collision detection model based on skeleton points. Subsequently, human motion prediction methods drive safety monitoring between humans and robots. Ultimately, personalised safety warning strategies are applied to ensure the safety of the assembly process. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital twin; Human-Robot collaboration assembly; personalised assembly; safety detection,Journal of Engineering Design,2024,Journal,Luo G.; Yan L.; Wang H.; Li H.; Wen X.; Liu G.; Zhang Y.; Sun C.; Yang W.; Xing H.,10.1080/09544828.2024.2357525
A human-centered perspective in repetitive assembly processes: preliminary investigation of cognitive support of collaborative robots,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is one of the paradigms of the emerging Industry 5.0, aimed at supporting humans in production processes. However, the introduction of an industrial robotic system in close contact with a human opens new challenges not only for safety but also for ergonomics. This paper aims to study whether the introduction of a collaborative robot into an assembly process can support the human operator not only physically but also cognitively. To address this research question, shifts of a repetitive assembly process were implemented in both manual and HRC settings. The two settings were compared over time by analyzing the evolution of generated process failures and physiological response, revealing potential differences in process quality and operator stress. © 2024 The Authors.

Pilot study of powered wearable robot use for simulated flooring work,"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders pose a significant threat to the health, safety, and retention of skilled workers in the construction industry. Construction trades, such as floor layers, perform physically demanding work involving lifting materials and maintaining awkward postures, triggering low back disorders. Active back-support exoskeletons have emerged as potential preventive technology. This paper evaluates the suitability of a commercially available active back-support exoskeleton for a simulated flooring task by assessing measures such as range of motion, perceived level of exertion, and cognitive load. No significant difference was observed in the comparison of these measures with and without the active exoskeleton. However, the use of the exoskeleton triggered slight reductions in the range of motion of the back, perceived exertion, and mental demand. These preliminary findings could motivate more studies into the design and evaluation of similar technologies for improving construction workforce health and safety. © International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2023.All rights reserved.",,"Computing in Civil Engineering 2023: Data, Sensing, and Analytics - Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2023",2024,Conference,Okunola A.; Akanmu A.; Gonsalves N.; Yusuf A.; Jebelli H.,10.1061/9780784485224.098
Validating the effectiveness of a self-report tool to predict unsafe behavior of industrial workers: a QEEG analysis,"Objectives. Unsafe behavior (UB) is defined as the likelihood of intentionally or unintentionally deviating from pre-defined plans. This study aims to investigate the validation of a self-report tool for measuring workers’ cognitive-based UB using quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Methods. The cognitive-based unsafe behavior questionnaire (CUBQ) was completed by 632 front-line workers in a manufacturing industry to identify differences in the backgrounds of the subjects regarding UBs. Two groups were then selected as extreme groups and QEEG was conducted based on the international 10–20 electrode placement. Results. The mean values of absolute power (AP), alpha/beta ratio (ABR) and alpha/gamma ratio (AGR) from brain oscillations in different regions of the cortex were significantly different between the studied groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, these values were found to be significantly correlated with slips, lapses and mistakes, as measured by certain scales of the CUBQ (p < 0.05). Conclusions. The findings of this study indicated differences in brain oscillation activities among industrial workers with different UB backgrounds. These results confirm the effectiveness of CUBQ as a proactive tool for safety practitioners to predict industrial workers’ UBs. © 2024 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).",cognitive factors; industrial workers; quantitative electroencephalography; unsafe behavior,International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics,2024,Journal,Shakerian M.; Nami M.; Jahangiri M.; Hasanzadeh J.; Alimohammadlou M.; Choobineh A.,10.1080/10803548.2024.2330249
Effects of Visual Prompts in Human-machine Interface for Construction Teleoperation System,"In construction teleoperation, particularly in disaster restoration, delicate manipulation of heavy machinery is crucial, based on a thorough understanding of the surroundings. Current practices have utilized multiple viewpoints to facilitate a thorough understanding of the site's 3D spatial layout. However, challenges might arise as visual cues within the surroundings could create distractions for teleoperators. Drawing from visual search theory and Gibson’s perception theory, exploring visual prompts in teleoperation interface could enhance performance by directing attention to key visual cues, reducing cognitive workload. Nonetheless, the evaluation of different visual prompts from human factors perspectives has been underexplored. Addressing challenges of potential distraction from multiple viewpoints and inappropriate visual prompts, this study emphasizes the necessity of exploring different visual prompts to most effectively guide operators’ attention in given work environments. The experiment, designed with low and high visual cue environments, focuses on debris removal and extended 3D Fitts' law tasks, evaluating spatial awareness and depth perception during teleoperation. The experiments were conducted with participants in construction-related fields with industrial experience. Performance measurements and subjective ratings with open-ended discussion was conducted. The findings show visual prompts' effects on distraction and visibility conditions concerning task-oriented difficulty levels in teleoperation. The experimental results can inform the optimal design of visual prompts in human-machine interface for teleoperation for complicated construction environments, highlighting the importance of the considerations of environments and task characteristics. © 2024 ISARC.

AI impacts on supply chain performance : a manufacturing use case study,"The integration of cross-company activities to form global supply chains (SC) has several benefits, including reducing costs, minimizing energy and resource waste, and promoting relationships for improving all network actors. However, as the number of tiers of suppliers and customers increases, monitoring processes and identifying problems becomes more challenging, which can threaten the continuity of the SC. To address this issue, the EU knowlEdge project proposes using artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that are distributed, scalable, and collaborative to enable automatic monitoring and learning in the SC. This approach replaces rigid organization with flexible networks that leverage self-learning algorithms and automatic value creation, thereby facilitating knowledge sharing. The project unifies technologies from various domains, including AI, data analytics, edge, and cloud computing, into a software architecture that offers a systemic solution rather than an incremental improvement. This architecture enhances SC performance, including adaptability and autonomy, and enables industry to adopt adaptive strategies. The platform’s functionality is tested in manufacturing, where it will improve production monitoring and planning and enable human intervention and learning. The AI application is expected to increase performance on various business and production indicators, which will also have an impact beyond the factory floor. With this approach, managers can respond quickly to changing customer requirements, while deviations in planned processes can be addressed more effectively. Additionally, the research conducted by the project will provide insights into future management and learning in SC. © The Author(s) 2023.",Artificial intelligence; Cognitive technologies; Digitalisation; IT architecture; Manufacturing; Supply chain,Discover Artificial Intelligence,2023,Journal,Walter S.,10.1007/s44163-023-00061-9
An integrated methodology for the assessment of stress and mental workload applied on virtual training,"The importance of training for operators in industrial contexts is widely highlighted in literature. Virtual Reality (VR) is considered an efficient solution for training, since it provides immersive, realistic, and interactive simulations environments promoting a learn-by-doing approach, far from the risks of the real field. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by several studies, but a proper assessment of the operator’s cognitive response in terms of stress and cognitive load during the use of such technology is still lacking. This paper proposes an integrated methodology for the analysis of user’s cognitive states, suitable for each kind of training in the industrial sector and beyond, fostering the human-centred design and manufacturing perspective. The methodology has been assessed using an industrial case study where virtual training is used for assembly of agricultural vehicles. Experimental results highlighted that, with VR additional supportive information, while operators’ errors drastically decrease, the stress increases for complex tasks, due to the greater amount of information to manage. The proposed protocol allows understanding the operators’ cognitive conditions in order to optimize the VR training application, avoiding operators’ stress, mental overload, and improving performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cognitive ergonomics; mental workload; stress; virtual assembly; Virtual reality; virtual training,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,2024,Journal,Brunzini A.; Grandi F.; Peruzzini M.; Pellicciari M.,10.1080/0951192X.2023.2189311
Mutual-cognition for proactive human–robot collaboration: A mixed reality-enabled visual reasoning-based method,"Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is key to achieving the flexible automation required by the mass personalization trend, especially towards human-centric intelligent manufacturing. Nevertheless, existing HRC systems suffer from poor task understanding and poor ergonomic satisfaction, which impede empathetic teamwork skills in task execution. To overcome the bottleneck, a Mixed Reality (MR) and visual reasoning-based method is proposed in this research, providing mutual-cognitive task assignment for human and robotic agents’ operations. Firstly, an MR-enabled mutual-cognitive HRC architecture is proposed, with the characteristic of monitoring Digital Twins states, reasoning co-working strategies, and providing cognitive services. Secondly, a visual reasoning approach is introduced, which learns scene interpretation from the visual perception of each agent’s actions and environmental changes to make task planning strategies satisfying human–robot operation needs. Lastly, a safe, ergonomic, and proactive robot motion planning algorithm is proposed to let a robot execute generated co-working strategies, while a human operator is supported with intuitive task operation guidance in the MR environment, achieving empathetic collaboration. Through a demonstration of a disassembly task of aging Electric Vehicle Batteries, the experimental result facilitates cognitive intelligence in Proactive HRC for flexible automation. © Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

A Review of HRV and EEG Technology Applications in Industry 5.0: Emphasising Manufacturing Efficiency and Worker Well-Being,"This review paper examines the role of physiological monitoring techniques in the manufacturing industry, particularly through the use of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Electroencephalography (EEG), aligning with the human-centric approach of Industry 5.0. Delving into the current applications and potential of these biometric tools, the paper highlights their significance in enhancing worker well-being, safety, cognitive workload management, and the optimisation of human-machine interactions. A systematic literature search employing the PRISMA framework was conducted, revealing a marked preference for HRV over EEG in current research, although both have been shown to offer substantial benefits. The review underscores the precision of ECG-based HRV measurements as pivotal for assessing autonomic nervous system activity, with implications for employee health outcomes. The analysis of EEG studies reflects its utility in mapping psychological states and fostering advanced Brain-Computer Interface technologies, contributing to safer and more efficient manufacturing processes. As the review concludes, the integration of HRV and EEG monitoring is poised to become a standard practice within the industry, signalling a shift towards manufacturing operations that prioritize the health and satisfaction of the workforce while maintaining operational excellence. The findings advocate for the adoption of these monitoring techniques as part of a larger strategy to ensure a responsive, adaptive, and worker-centric manufacturing environment.

Pick the Right Co-Worker: Online Assessment of Cognitive Ergonomics in Human-Robot Collaborative Assembly,"Human-robot collaborative assembly systems enhance the efficiency and productivity of the workplace but may increase the workers' cognitive demand. This article proposes an online and quantitative framework to assess the cognitive workload induced by the interaction with a co-worker, either a human operator or an industrial collaborative robot with different control strategies. The approach monitors the operator's attention distribution and upper body kinematics benefiting from the input images of a low-cost stereo camera and cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms (i.e., head pose estimation and skeleton tracking). Three experimental scenarios with variations in workstation features and interaction modalities were designed to test the performance of our online method against state-of-the-art offline measurements. The results proved that our vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the new generation of collaborative robotic technologies. The latter would enable human cognitive state monitoring and robot control strategy adaptation for improving human comfort, ergonomics, and trust in automation. © 2023 The Authors.",Cognitive ergonomics; human factors; human-robot collaboration (HRC); trust in automation,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,2023,Journal,Lagomarsino M.; Lorenzini M.; Balatti P.; Momi E.D.; Ajoudani A.,10.1109/TCDS.2022.3182811
WebAR as a Mediation Tool Focused on Reading and Understanding of Technical Drawings Regarding Tailor-Made Projects for the Scenographic Industry,"Among the leading immersive technologies, augmented reality is one of the most promising and empowering for supporting designers in production environments. This research investigates the application of mobile augmented reality, based on the Web, as a mediation tool focused on cognitive activities of reading and understanding of technical drawings in the production and assembly of tailor-made projects of the scenographic industry. In this context, the research presents a method to use WebAR to improve the reading of technical drawings, seeking efficiency in the visualization of models and the exchange of information between professionals involved in the processes of design, production, and assembly of products, in the scope of scenography. This mediation tool was developed using Web AR platforms, compatible with native libraries (ARCore and ARKit) to ensure, first, compatibility with commonly used devices that workers or businesses can access, and second, to leverage hybrid tracking techniques that combine vision and sensors to improve the reliability of augmented reality viewing. The proposed solution adopts multiple tracking and navigation techniques in order to expand Space Skills components to provide greater exploratory freedom to users. The research process took place in light of the Design Science Research Methodology and the DSR-Model, since it aimed to develop a solution to a practical problem, as well as to produce knowledge from this process. Field experiments were conducted in two real companies, with end users on their respective mobile devices, in order to evaluate usability and behavioral intent, through the Acceptance, Intent, and Use of Technology questionnaires and perceived mental workload, NASA-TLX.

Sustainable Ergonomic Workplace: Fostering Job Satisfaction and Productivity among Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Workers,"The business process outsourcing (BPO) sector is important in managing business especially in a developing country like the Philippines. Call centers are one of the most common type of industries within the BPO sector as they generate 75.1% of its revenues. Given the lack of studies regarding the ergonomic factors in the BPO industry, the goal of this research is to examine the relationships of different ergonomic domains on the job satisfaction and overall productivity of the BPO agents in a customer service or call center industry. The data were gathered through an online survey and the approach used for this study was a variance-based partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation. Through analysis, it was proven that macro-ergonomics and physical ergonomics have significant effects on the overall productivity of BPO workers, while cognitive and macro-ergonomics have a significant influence on job satisfaction. In addition to this, it was also proven in the study that overall productivity and job satisfaction were significantly associated. This is one of the first studies to investigate and examine the relationship between ergonomic domains and the productivity and job satisfaction of a Filipino BPO or call center worker. The results of this study could be used as a reference for further investigations by future researchers, especially on more ergonomic factors as well as the extrinsic variables that were not covered by the researchers of this paper. In addition to this, the proposed framework might also be adapted and used as a reference for further studies to produce more accurate and updated results. © 2023 by the authors.",business process outsourcing; call centers; ergonomic domains; PLS-SEM; structural equation modeling,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023,Journal,Gumasing M.J.J.; Rendon E.R.A.; German J.D.,10.3390/su151813516
Human-centred data-driven redesign of simulation-based training: a qualitative study applied on two use cases of the healthcare and industrial domains,"Among the main features of Industry 4.0, digitization and the evolution of the human-machine interaction occupy a central role. These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0. The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Design optimization; Ergonomics; Healthcare 4.0; Human Factors; Industry 4.0; Simulation-based training,Journal of Industrial Information Integration,2023,Journal,BRUNZINI A.; PERUZZINI M.; BARBADORO P.,10.1016/j.jii.2023.100505
Aging Workforce and Learning: State-of-the-art,"The population of most developed countries is aging; thus, the median age of the global workforce continues to rise. Human aging often results in a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, which may adversely affect the performance of labor-intensive manufacturing systems. Older workers embody profound experience and refined skills, which are success factors for manufacturing companies. Therefore, it is important for manufacturing companies to ensure that older workers remain active and productive. Identifying the potential of an aging workforce, employing technical assistance systems to meet their needs, customizing work flow processes, imparting proper training, and utilizing their experience and skills may provide a competitive advantage for the company. This paper reviews the relevant literature to understand how aging influences workers' learning in the manufacturing and service industries and identifies management concepts and technologies suitable to support an active aging workforce. We report preliminary insights and discuss selected papers on how aging influences learning-by-doing, life-long learning, training, and experiential knowledge retention. Finally, we propose some future research directions. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

It is also helping organisations to take on challenges like demand fluctuations and market volatility. Industry 4.0 is also the interconnection of computers, materials, and AI with minimal human intervention in decision-making. Although Industry 4.0 has tremendous potential for industrial growth, it has many challenges, such as technical integration, human resource issue, supply chain issues and data security.

Augmented Reality for Supporting Workers in Human–Robot Collaboration,"This paper discusses the potential benefits of using augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance human–robot collaborative industrial processes. The authors describe a real-world use case at Siemens premises in which an AR-based authoring tool is used to reduce cognitive load, assist human workers in training robots, and support calibration and inspection tasks during assembly tasks. The study highlights the potential of AR as a solution for optimizing human–robot collaboration and improving productivity. The article describes the methodology used to deploy and evaluate the ARContent tool, which demonstrated improved usability, reduced task load, and increased efficiency in the assembly process. However, the study is limited by the restricted availability of workers and their knowledge of assembly tasks with robots. The authors suggest that future work should focus on testing the ARContent tool with a larger user pool and improving the authoring tool based on the shortcomings identified during the study. Overall, this work shows the potential for AR technology to revolutionize industrial processes and improve collaboration between humans and robots. © 2023 by the authors.",augmented reality; collaborative robotics; connected factory; guidance; human–robot collaboration; Industry 5.0,Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,2023,Journal,Moya A.; Bastida L.; Aguirrezabal P.; Pantano M.; Abril-Jiménez P.,10.3390/mti7040040
Towards the Cognitive Factory in Industry 5.0: From Concept to Implementation,"Industry 5.0 (I5.0) represents a shift towards a human-centered industry and emphasizes the integration of human and machine capabilities. A highly compatible concept for enabling the I5.0 implementation is intelligent spaces (ISs), i.e., physical spaces equipped with a network of sensors, which obtains information about the place it observes, and a network of actuators, which enables changes in the environment through computing services. These spaces can sense, interpret, recognize user behavior, adapt to preferences, and provide natural interactions between humans and intelligent systems, using the IoT, AI, computer vision, data analytics, etc., to create dynamic and adaptive environments in real time. The integration of ISs and I5.0 has paved the way for the development of cognitive factories, which transform industrial environments into ISs. In this context, this article explores the convergence of IS and I5.0 concepts and aims to provide insights into the technical implementation challenges of cognitive factories. It discusses the development and implementation of a laboratory replica of a cognitive cell as an example of a segment of a cognitive factory.

Dynamic Human–Robot Collision Risk Based on Octree Representation,"The automation of manufacturing applications where humans and robots operate in a shared environment imposes new challenges for presenting the operator’s safety and robot’s efficiency. Common solutions relying on isolating the robots’ workspace from human access during their operation are not applicable for HRI. This paper presents an extended reality-based method to enhance human cognitive awareness of the potential risk due to dynamic robot behavior towards safe human–robot collaborative manufacturing operations. A dynamic and state-aware occupancy probability map indicating the forthcoming risk of human–robot accidental collision in the 3D workspace of the robot is introduced. It is determined using octrees and is rendered in a virtual or augmented environment using Unity 3D. A combined framework allows the generation of both static zones (taking into consideration the entire configuration space of the robot) and dynamic zones (generated in real time by fetching the occupancy data corresponding to the robot’s current configuration), which can be utilized for short-term collision risk prediction. This method is then applied in a virtual environment of the workspace of an industrial robotic arm, and we also include the necessary technical adjustments for the method to be applied in an AR setting. © 2023 by the authors.",AR applications; human–robot interaction; robotics; VR applications,Machines,2023,Journal,Anatoliotakis N.; Paraskevopoulos G.; Michalakis G.; Michalellis I.; Zacharaki E.I.; Koustoumpardis P.; Moustakas K.,10.3390/machines11080793
An Empirical Study on Workers' Preferences in Human-Robot Task Assignment in Industrial Assembly Systems,"Collaborative industrial robotic arms (cobots) are integrated industrial assembly systems relieving their human coworkers from monotonous tasks and achieving productivity gains. The question of task allocation arises in the organization of these human-robot interactions. State of the art shows static, compensatory task allocation approaches in current assembly systems and flexible, adaptive task sharing (ATS) approaches in human factors research. The latter should exploit the economic and ergonomic advantages of cobot usage. Previous research results did not provide a clear insight into whether industrial workers prefer static or adaptive task allocation and which tasks workers do prefer to assign to cobots. Therefore, we set up a cobot demonstrator with a realistic industrial assembly use case and did a user study with experienced workers from the shop floor (n = 25). The aim of the user study is to provide a systematic understanding and evaluation of workers' preferences in a practical context of human-robot interaction (HRI) in assembly. Our main findings are that participants preferred the ATS concept to a predetermined task allocation and reported increased satisfaction with the allocation. Results show that participants are more likely to give manual tasks to the cobot in contrast to cognitive tasks. It shows that workers do not entrust all tasks to robots, but like to take over cognitive tasks by themselves.

As computer technology advances day by day, the chances of data being misused and tampered with are also growing daily. The advancement in technology results in various cyber-attacks on computers and mobile devices. DF plays a vital role in the investigation and prevention of cyber-attacks. DF can be used to find the shreds of evidence and prevent attacks from happening in the future. Earlier presented reviews highlighted specific issues in DF only. This paper explores deeply DF issues by highlighting domain-specific issues and possible helpful areas for DF. This article highlights the investigation process framework and related approaches for the digital investigation process. The cognitive and human factors that affect the DF process are also presented to strengthen the investigation process. Nowadays, many DF tools are available in the industry that helps in DF investigation. A comparative analysis of the four DF tools is also presented. Finally DF performance is discussed. The submitted work may help the researchers go deeper into DF and apply the best tools and models according to their requirements. © 2023, Zarka Private University.

The Human Factors of AI-Empowered Knowledge Sharing,"Many industries are facing the challenge of how to capture workers' knowledge such that it can be shared, in particular tacit knowledge. The operation of complex systems such as a manufacturing line is knowledge-intensive, especially if the operator must frequently reconfigure it for different products. Considering the breadth and dynamic nature of this knowledge, existing solutions for sharing knowledge (e.g., word-of-mouth, issue reports, document creation, and decision support systems) are inefficient and/or resource-intensive. Conversational user interfaces are an efficient way to convey information that mimics the way humans share knowledge; however, we know little about how to design them specifically for this purpose, especially regarding tacit knowledge. In this work, my main goal is to investigate how a cognitive assistant can be designed to facilitate (tacit) knowledge transfer between users of dynamic complex systems. I aim to achieve this by outlining the design requirements, challenges, and opportunities in factories; by collaboratively designing, implementing, and evaluating a cognitive assistant for sharing knowledge; studying the effects of design characteristics on aspects such as user experience; and finally, creating a set of design guidelines. © 2023 Owner/Author.",chatbots; cognitive assistant; human-centred AI; industry 5.0; knowledge sharing,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,2023,Conference,Kernan Freire S.,10.1145/3544549.3577044
Evolution of the Human Role in Manufacturing Systems: On the Route from Digitalization and Cybernation to Cognitization,"Modern society is living at a time of revolutionary changes in all areas of human life. For example, the field of industrial manufacturing has greatly influenced the role of human beings during the past 30 years. Modern manufacturing systems are in a phase of transition, in accordance with the concept of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). A new manufacturing paradigm based on the principles of Industry 4.0 is presented by Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS). A basic building block of SMS is cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), which together with innovative-management principles of emergence, self-organization, learning, open innovation, collaboration and the networking of people and organizations are the key principles of Industry 4.0. The three key enablers of Industry 4.0, i.e., the connectivity, the digitization and the cybernation of work processes in manufacturing systems, have paved the way for a new industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 5.0 concept that is bringing about a new paradigm in the field of manufacturing systems, the so-called Adaptive Cognitive Manufacturing Systems (ACMS). A fundamental building block of ACMS is the new generation of manufacturing systems called Cognitive Cyber-Physical Production Systems (C-CPPS), which are based on CPPS concepts and incorporate cognitive technologies and artificial intelligence. This paper presents the revolutionary development of manufacturing and manufacturing systems through the industrial revolutions and the evolution of the role of humans in manufacturing systems towards Industry 5.0. © 2023 by the authors.",adaptive cognitive manufacturing systems; cognitive cyber-physical production system; cognitization; cybernation; digitalization; human role; Industry 4.0; Industry 5.0,Applied System Innovation,2023,Journal,Hozdić E.; Makovec I.,10.3390/asi6020049
HELOT-Hunting Evil Life in Operational Technology,"Operational technology (OT) refers to the industrial counterpart of information technology (IT). OT encompasses technology, systems, and protocols used in industrial operations for controlling, monitoring, and operating of industrial systems. Unlike standard IT systems, OT systems, such as those used in the industry, usually cannot be taken off-line in the event of postmortem forensics investigations. To remedy this situation we present a software architecture and prototype realization that allows the continuous capture of events within OT systems, IT systems, and the interconnected network(s). Our architecture can be realized with existing technologies while also allowing for extension and customization in functionality as well as application to diverse domains. We outline two application cases: capturing of forensics artifacts from a live OT system and possible paths for automation to reduce the cognitive load for cybersecurity operators in combined IT/OT environments.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Computer forensics; cybersecurity operations; operational technology; power-delivery systems,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2023,Journal,Akailvi S.; Gautam U.; Bhandari P.; Rashid H.; Huff P.D.; Springer J.P.,10.1109/TSG.2022.3222261
Pupillometry for Measuring User Response to Movement of an Industrial Robot,"Interactive systems can adapt to individual users to increase productivity, safety, or acceptance. Previous research focused on different factors, such as cognitive workload (CWL), to better understand and improve the human-computer or human-robot interaction (HRI). We present results of an HRI experiment that uses pupillometry to measure users' responses to robot movements. Our results demonstrate a significant change in pupil dilation, indicating higher CWL, as a result of increased movement speed of an articulated robot arm. This might permit improved interaction ergonomics by adapting the behavior of robots or other devices to individual users at run time.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",cognitive workload; human-robot interaction; pervasive eye tracking; pupil dilation,Eye Tracking Research and Applications Symposium (ETRA),2023,Conference,Hostettler D.; Bektaş K.; Mayer S.,10.1145/3588015.3590123
A mixed perception-based human-robot collaborative maintenance approach driven by augmented reality and online deep reinforcement learning,"Owing to the fact that the number and complexity of machines is increasing in Industry 4.0, the maintenance process is more time-consuming and labor-intensive, which contains plenty of refined maintenance operations. Fortunately, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can integrate human intelligence into the collaborative robot (cobot), which can realize not merely the nimble and sapiential maintenance operations of personnel but also the reliable and repeated maintenance manipulation of cobots. However, the existing HRC maintenance lacks the precise understand of the maintenance intention, the efficient HRC decision-making for executing robotized maintenance tasks (e.g., repetitive manual tasks) and the convenient interaction interface for executing cognitive tasks (e.g., maintenance preparation and guidance job). Hence, a mixed perception-based human-robot collaborative maintenance approach consisting of three-hierarchy structures is proposed in this paper, which can help reduce the severity of the mentioned problems. In the first stage, a mixed perception module is proposed to help the cobot recognize human safety and maintenance request according to human actions and gestures separately. During the second stage, an improved online deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making module with the asynchronous structure and the function of anti-disturbance is proposed in this paper, which can realize the execution of robotized maintenance tasks. In the third stage, an augmented reality-assisted (AR) user-friendly interaction interface is designed to help the personnel interact with the cobot and execute the auxiliary maintenance task without the limitation of spatial and human factors. In addition, the auxiliary of maintenance operation can also be supported by the AR-assisted visible guidance. Finally, comparative numerical experiments are implemented in a typical machining workshop, and the experimental results show a competitive performance of the proposed HRC maintenance approach compared with other state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Augmented reality; Decision-making; Human-robot collaborative maintenance; Mixed perception; Online deep reinforcement learning,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,Liu C.; Zhang Z.; Tang D.; Nie Q.; Zhang L.; Song J.,10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102568
Harnessing Large Language Models for Cognitive Assistants in Factories,"As agile manufacturing expands and workforce mobility increases, the importance of efficient knowledge transfer among factory workers grows. Cognitive Assistants (CAs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5, can bridge knowledge gaps and improve worker performance in manufacturing settings. This study investigates the opportunities, risks, and user acceptance of LLM-powered CAs in two factory contexts: textile and detergent production. Several opportunities and risks are identified through a literature review, proof-of-concept implementation, and focus group sessions. Factory representatives raise concerns regarding data security, privacy, and the reliability of LLMs in high-stake environments. By following design guidelines regarding persistent memory, real-time data integration, security, privacy, and ethical concerns, LLM-powered CAs can become valuable assets in manufacturing settings and other industries.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",cognitive assistant; conversational user interfaces; human-centered AI; industry 5.0; knowledge management; knowledge sharing,"Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Conversational User Interfaces, CUI 2023",2023,Conference,Kernan Freire S.; Foosherian M.; Wang C.; Niforatos E.,10.1145/3571884.3604313
Influences of smart glasses on postural control under single- and dual-task conditions for ergonomic risk assessment,"Head worn displays have become increasingly popular at workplaces in logistics and assembly lines in recent years. Such displays are expected to improve productivity and safety at the workplace. However, their impact on balance in the workforce is still an open research question. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the Vuzix M400 and Realwear HMT1 smart glasses on postural control. A laboratory study was conducted with eleven participants. Balance parameters were recorded during bilateral quiet stance, together with parameters of cognitive load. The two different smart glasses used in this study were compared with a monitor and a tablet under single-task conditions and while performing a spatial 2-back task. As balance parameters, the prediction ellipse and sample entropy in anteroposterior as well as mediolateral direction of the center-of-pressure data were examined. No significant differences were observed in the cognitive task performance between the devices. The prediction ellipse of the smart glasses was smaller than the tablets but larger than the smartboard. The dynamic of sample entropy data suggests that the use of the spatial 2-back task induces postural sway in the participants. This effect was most profound when looking at the monitor and least recognizable in the data of the tablet.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",center-of-pressure; cognitive-load; head worn displays; prediction ellipse; sample entropy,Biomedizinische Technik,2023,Journal,Tenholt J.; Adam S.; Laun M.; Schiefer C.; Terschüren C.; Harth V.; Karamanidis K.; Hartmann U.; Friemert D.,10.1515/bmt-2022-0404
A human factors perspective on how to keep SAE Level 3 conditional automated driving safe,"The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines Conditional Automated Driving (CAD) or SAE level 3 as the next step in the transition to higher automated driving. A human factors challenge at this level is to keep the fallback-ready user aware of the driving situation. The problem with the widely accepted terminology of SAE is that it does not consider the human factors of achieving this safety-critical transition and lacks in defining a required or appropriate state of fallback readiness and how a human reaches this state. This paper aims to understand how research and industry currently perceive the problem and how they counteract it. We conducted exploratory expert interviews with N = 15 subject matter experts from universities, research centres and vehicle manufacturers. Based on the findings of the expert interviews, we discuss how fallback-ready users might be kept in the loop. The results show that the user should remain physically and sensory in the state of regular drivers to allow a safe transition, which narrows down the problem to maintaining an appropriate cognitive state, level of arousal, and motivational conditions. Lastly, the experts identify that the NDRA should be (a) limited to the onboard-entertainment system and (b) context-aware and (temporarily) restricted or interrupted. We provide concrete design recommendations grounded in (or drawing upon) theoretical frameworks and current human factors expert views and highlight specific challenges that require more research. © 2023 The Author(s)",Automation supervision; Conditional automated driving; Driver state; Fallback readiness; Interruption management; Non-driving related activity,Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,2023,Journal,Gerber M.A.; Schroeter R.; Ho B.,10.1016/j.trip.2023.100959
Deep learning based robot cognitive architecture for collaborative assembly tasks,"As the manufacturing industry becomes more agile, the use of collaborative robots capable of safely working with humans is becoming more prevalent, while adaptable and natural interaction is a goal yet to be achieved. This work presents a cognitive architecture composed of perception and reasoning modules that allows a robot to adapt its actions while collaborating with humans in an assembly task. Human action recognition perception is performed using convolutional neural network models with inertial measurement unit and skeleton tracking data. The action predictions are used for task status reasoning which predicts the time left for each action in a task allowing a robot to plan future actions. The task status reasoning uses a recurrent neural network method which is developed for transferability to new actions and tasks. Updateable input parameters allowing the system to optimise for each user and task with each trial performed are also investigated. Finally, the complete system is demonstrated with the collaborative assembly of a small chair and wooden box, along with a solo robot task of stacking objects performed when it would otherwise be idle. The human actions recognised are using a screw driver, Allen key, hammer and hand screwing, with online accuracies between 83–92%. User trials demonstrate the robot deciding when to start collaborative actions in order to synchronise with the user, as well as deciding when it has time to complete an action on its solo task before a collaborative action is required. © 2023 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Human action recognition; Human–robot collaboration; Industry 4.0,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,Male J.; Martinez-Hernandez U.,10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102572
Evaluating visual encoding quality of a mixed reality user interface for human–machine co-assembly in complex operational terrain,"During human–machine collaboration in manufacturing activities, it is important to provide real-time annotations in the three-dimensional workspace for local workers who may lack relevant experience and knowledge. For example, in MR assembly, workers need to be alerted to avoid entering hazardous areas when manually replacing components. Recently, many researchers have explored various visual cues for expressing physical task progress information in the MR interface of intelligent systems. However, the relationship between the implantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D reconstruction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably. © 2023",Co-assembly; Complex operational terrain; Mixed reality; User interface; Visual encoding,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2023,Journal,Wang Z.; Zhang X.; Li L.; Zhou Y.; Lu Z.; Dai Y.; Liu C.; Su Z.; Bai X.; Billinghurst M.,10.1016/j.aei.2023.102171
A Neurophysiological Evaluation of Cognitive Load during Augmented Reality Interactions in Various Industrial Maintenance and Assembly Tasks,"Augmented reality (AR) has been shown to improve productivity in industry, but its adverse effects (e.g., headaches, eye strain, nausea, and mental workload) on users warrant further investigation. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of different instruction methods (i.e., HoloLens AR-based and paper-based instructions) and task complexity (low and high-demanding tasks) on cognitive workloads and performance. Twenty-eight healthy males with a mean age of 32.12 (SD 2.45) years were recruited in this study and were randomly divided into two groups. The first group performed the experiment using AR-based instruction, and the second group used paper-based instruction. Performance was measured using total task time (TTT). The cognitive workload was measured using the power of electroencephalograph (EEG) features and the NASA task load index (NASA TLX). The results showed that using AR instructions resulted in a reduction in maintenance times and an increase in mental workload compared to paper instructions, particularly for the more demanding tasks. With AR instruction, 0.45% and 14.94% less time was spent on low- and high-demand tasks, respectively, as compared to paper instructions. According to the EEG features, employing AR to guide employees during highly demanding maintenance tasks increased information processing, which could be linked with an increased germane cognitive load. Increased germane cognitive load means participants can better facilitate long-term knowledge and skill acquisition. These results suggested that AR is superior and recommended for highly demanding maintenance tasks since it speeds up maintenance times and increases the possibility that information is stored in long-term memory and encrypted for recalls. © 2023 by the authors.",augmented reality (AR); cognitive workload; electroencephalography (EEG); human performance; maintenance task complexity,Sensors,2023,Journal,Alessa F.M.; Alhaag M.H.; Al-harkan I.M.; Ramadan M.Z.; Alqahtani F.M.,10.3390/s23187698
Specifying task allocation in automotive wire harness assembly stations for Human-Robot Collaboration,"Wire harness assembly is normally a manual assembly process that poses ergonomic challenges. As a consequence of the rapidly expanding electrification of vehicles and transportation systems, the demand for wire harnesses can be expected to grow radically, further increasing assembly operator challenges. Thus, automating this assembly process is highly prioritised by production engineers. The rapid development of industrial robot technology has enabled more human-robot collaboration possibilities, simplifying the automation of wire harness process tasks. However, successful automation applications involving humans require efficient and safe allocation of tasks between humans and technology. Unfortunately, present assembly system design methods may be obsolete and insufficient in light of the capabilities of emerging automation technologies such as collaborative robots. This paper presents a design and specification methodology for human-centred manufacturing systems and focuses on collaborative assembly operations in complex production systems. A case study on human-robot collaboration provides an application example from a wire-harness collaborative assembly process. The proposed design methodology combines hierarchical task analysis with assessments of cognitive and physical Levels of Automation (LoAc and LoAp). The assessments are then followed by evaluations of the Levels of human-robot Collaboration (LoC) and the Levels of operator Skill requirements (LoSr) respectively. A task allocation matrix supports the identification of possible combinations of automation and collaboration solutions for a human-centred and collaborative wire harness assembly process. System designers and integrators may utilise the design and specification methodology to identify the potential and extent of human-robot collaboration in collaborative manufacturing assembly operations. © 2023 The Author(s)",Assembly; Automotive; Human-robot collaboration (HRC); Levels of automation (LoA); Wire Harness,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023,Journal,Salunkhe O.; Stahre J.; Romero D.; Li D.; Johansson B.,10.1016/j.cie.2023.109572
A critical review on applications of artificial intelligence in manufacturing,"The fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, has brought internet, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) concepts into manufacturing. There is an immediate need to understand the capabilities of AI and ML and how they can be implemented in manufacturing domains. This article presents a detailed survey of AI algorithms and their use in manufacturing. The article treats casting, forming, machining, welding, additive manufacturing (AM), and supply chain management (SCM) as six manufacturing verticals. The horizontals in each vertical are the descriptions including, the evolution of each process from the mechanization era to the present-day scenario, and developments in the automation of processes by processing signal and image information and applying ML and AI algorithms. The evolution of robotics and cloud-based technologies is also discussed. The critical review gives a realistic view of manufacturing automation and benefits of AI. Further, the article discusses several manufacturing use cases where AI and ML algorithms are deployed. As a future research direction, human-like intelligence is introduced highlighting the necessity of cognitive skills in manufacturing. In a nutshell, a reader can logically explain why, when, and how far AI will define complete manufacturing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Artificial intelligence; Cognitive manufacturing; Deep learning; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Manufacturing,Artificial Intelligence Review,2023,Journal,Mypati O.; Mukherjee A.; Mishra D.; Pal S.K.; Chakrabarti P.P.; Pal A.,10.1007/s10462-023-10535-y
New Short Scale to Measure Workers’ Attitudes Toward the Implementation of Cooperative Robots in Industrial Work Settings: Instrument Development and Exploration of Attitude Structure,"The implementation of new robotic technology at workplaces is oftentimes accompanied by social and organizational change processes. A new context-specific questionnaire was developed as a diagnostic tool to measure workers’ attitudes toward mobile cooperative manufacturing robots to provide a basis for managerial decisions and interventions—the “Attitudes toward Cooperative Industrial Robots Questionnaire” (ACIR-Q). Two samples, an online sample of 355 German manufacturing workers and a field sample of 201 workers from 4 local manufacturing companies were collected. For a large item pool, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify the attitudinal factor structure. Data showed a combined affective-behavioral factor and two cognitive factors on task-related and social-related beliefs. Based on this, the 12-item short scale ACIR-Q was derived using ant colony optimization. As attitudes can also be interpreted as networks of evaluative responses, network analysis was used for further insights. The small-world network structure (high clustering and connectivity) allows to hold complex attitudes and centrality measures indicate the most influential evaluative responses. Additionally, we explored relationships between workers’ attitudes and interpersonal variables (perceived competence, perceived control, and general self-efficacy), as well as social/organizational variables (trust in management, support climate, job insecurity and job characteristics). Based on the results, practical implications are suggested to improve workers’ attitudes. © 2023, The Author(s).",Human-robot interaction; Innovation; Manufacturing; Network analysis; Organizational change; Technology acceptance,International Journal of Social Robotics,2023,Journal,Leichtmann B.; Hartung J.; Wilhelm O.; Nitsch V.,10.1007/s12369-023-00996-0
"The affective, behavioural and cognitive outcomes of agile project management: A preliminary meta-analysis","Agile project management (APM) refers to a set of project management frameworks that are increasingly common in a range of industries. Even though the positive effects of APM for employees and organizations are widely assumed, no systematic account of affective, behavioural and cognitive outcomes appears in the academic literature. In this pre-registered meta-analysis, we examine the effects of APM based on K = 40 records (with k = 41 independent studies, N = 73,825). Our analyses indicate the beneficial effects of APM across outcomes: For the affective outcomes of job satisfaction, affective strain and organizational commitment, the effect sizes were, on average, small. For the behavioural outcomes of performance and innovative behaviour, the effect sizes were medium to large. For the cognitive outcome of psychological empowerment, the results of our meta-analysis suggest a medium effect. Furthermore, we explore the moderating effects of contextual (team size, occupational groups, culture) and methodological boundary conditions (publication status, study design, levels of analysis, study quality). Compared to studies conducted with software developers, the effect sizes are stronger in other occupations, such as manufacturing, health care and logistics. Moreover, stronger effect sizes are found in published than in unpublished records. We conclude by discussing the state of quantitative APM research and highlight avenues for future study. © 2022 The Authors.

Augmented reality for industrial quality inspection: An experiment assessing task performance and human factors,"Augmented reality (AR) technologies promise to increase the flexibility and productivity of the workforce by providing real-time information to workers right where it is needed. Following Cognitive Load Theory and Attention Theory, AR assistance can reduce the burden on workers’ mental capacity while performing a task, thereby improving task performance. The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors. © 2023 The Author(s)",Augmented reality; Cognitive load; Experiment; Head-mounted display; Manufacturing; Quality inspection,Computers in Industry,2023,Journal,Seeliger A.; Cheng L.; Netland T.,10.1016/j.compind.2023.103985
Manual assembly and Human–Robot Collaboration in repetitive assembly processes: a structured comparison based on human-centered performances,"Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC) represents an innovative solution able to enhance quality and adaptability of production processes. However, to fully exploit the benefits of HRC, human factors must be also taken into account. A novel experimental setting involving a repetitive assembly process is presented to investigate the effects of prolonged HRC on user experience and performance. Each participant was involved in two 4-h shifts: a manual assembly setting and a HRC one. The response variables collected in the study included self-reported affective state, perceived body discomfort, perceived workload, physiological signals for stress (i.e., heart rate variability and electrodermal activity), process and product defectiveness. Experimental results showed less upper limb exertion in the HRC setting, emphasizing the contribution of cobots in improving physical ergonomics in repetitive processes. Furthermore, results showed reduced mental effort, stress, and fewer process defects in the HRC setting, highlighting how collaborative robotics can improve process quality by supporting operators from a cognitive point of view in repetitive processes. © 2023, The Author(s).",Human factors; Human–robot collaboration; Industry 5.0; Mental workload; Repetitive assembly; User experience,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2023,Journal,Gervasi R.; Capponi M.; Mastrogiacomo L.; Franceschini F.,10.1007/s00170-023-11197-4
An Eye Movement Study in Unconventional Usage of Different Software Tools,"One of the main challenges of Human-Computer Interaction is the creation of UIs that enable the use of different systems in an easy and understandable method. The study analyses the student audience who uses software tools differently from the basis. In the research, two languages supporting UI implementation related to.NET technology, XAML and classic C#, were compared in terms of the cognitive load of test subjects. The results of the traditional knowledge level assessment tests and the answers to the questionnaires show that the UI implementation described in XAML is easier to read and understand than the same description in classic C#. When viewing the source codes, the eye movement parameters of the test subjects were also recorded and then evaluated, where a significant difference in the number and duration of fixations was observed, i.e., the interpretation of the classic C# source code showed a larger cognitive load. Overall, the results of the eye movement parameters supported the results of the other two measurement methods when comparing the different types of UI descriptions. The results established in the study and its conclusion may have an impact on programming education as well as industrial software development in the future, and also clearly shows the importance of choosing the development technology that best suits the person or development team. © 2023 by the author.",classic C#; cognition load; eye-tracking; programming; XAML,Sensors,2023,Journal,Katona J.,10.3390/s23083823
Human error contribution to accidents in the manufacturing sector: A structured approach to evaluate the interdependence among performance shaping factors,"Since the 1970s, Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) methods have received a great interest for the quantification of the Human Error Probability (HEP) in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). To this purpose, the second-generation HRA methods consider contextual and cognitive factors - named Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) - that may influence the workers’ performance during tasks execution. Despite the recent extension of HRA methods to different fields, only few studies refer to the manufacturing sector. In addition, the majority of contributions assume the independence among PSFs, which may result in an over or under estimation of HEP. Therefore, the present paper focuses on the manufacturing sector to propose a Fuzzy DEMATEL (FDEMATEL) based method to support the risk analyst in the quantification of PSF interrelationships and importance, when computing HEP. As a result, the most influential human factors on which taking priority actions to improve the overall human reliability may be identified accurately. Based on a selected list of PSFs, the methodological approach is implemented in an Italian textile company, where experience and training factors are demonstrated to be the most central ones to increase the human reliability when performing the weaving process tasks. The designed approach is well structured and effortless as well as it allows at considering the uncertainty and vagueness of input data and a group decision context. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Fuzzy DEMATEL; Human Error Probability (HEP); Human Reliability Analysis (HRA); Interdependence; Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs),Safety Science,2023,Journal,La Fata C.M.; Adelfio L.; Micale R.; La Scalia G.,10.1016/j.ssci.2023.106067
"Enabling productivity goals through construction 4.0 skills: Theories, debates, definitions","Construction 4.0, derived from Industry 4.0, was introduced to the construction industry as a means of addressing current issues and enhancing industry productivity. Adoption of this concept has placed a significant demand on Construction 4.0 skills, as the industry is undergoing a transformation that calls for new strategies and specialized skill sets. While Construction 4.0 promises significant productivity gains, its widespread adoption often overlooks the crucial role of specialized skills, leading to a mismatch in expected outcomes. The often-underexplored theoretical dimensions of Construction 4.0 skills has the potential to bridge the gap between these skills and formulation of productivity goals and achieving them, highlighting the profound importance of understanding and integrating these skills in the context of Construction 4.0. While there has been a recent interest in Construction 4.0 skills across various national contexts, the theoretical dimensions of skills within the realm of Construction 4.0 remains unexplored. Therefore, this study examines the definitions, interpretations, and theories of skills within the context of Construction 4.0. Through a conceptual review of existing academic literature and policy documents, this research offers profound understanding of defintions and how the theories of Construction 4.0 intersect with skills development and thus impact the formulation of productivity goals. The definitions of Industry 4.0/Construction 4.0 formulated in various national frameworks are defined in accordance with their geographical, social, and cultural contexts and that have distinct production aims and scopes. The identified theoretical underpinnings of Construction 4.0 include digital building ecosystem, lean construction, circular economy, smart cities, and skills-related theories such as social learning theory, human capital theory, cognitive load theory, situated learning theory, and lifelong learning theory. The examination brings forth novel insights that promise to shape the future of Construction 4.0 skills development. By bridging the gap between theoretical constructs and productivity goals (labour efficiency, process efficiency, time efficiency, waste reduction, energy and water efficiency) within the context of Construction 4.0, this study offers a fresh perspective that integrates technology, sustainability, and collaboration to propel productivity goals.

On the potential of pupil size as a metric of physical fatigue during a repeated handle push/pull task,"Force output and muscle activity represent the gold standards for measuring physical fatigue. This study explores using ocular metrics for tracking changes in physical fatigue during the completion of a repeated handle push/pull task. Participants completed this task over three trials, and pupil size was recorded by means of a head-mounted eye-tracker. Blink frequency was also measured. Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Blink rate; Cognitive load; EMG; Ergonomics; Eye-tracking; Force; Industry; Injury; Measurement; Muscle; Ocular motor behaviour; Repetitive task; Workers,Applied Ergonomics,2023,Journal,Biondi F.N.; Graf F.; Cort J.,10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104025
Visual inspection with augmented reality head-mounted display: An Australian usability case study,"Augmented reality (AR) is an Industry 4.0 technology. For more than a decade, advancements in AR technology and their applications have been expected to revolutionise the manufacturing industry and deliver quality and productivity gains. However, due to factors such as equipment costs, skills shortages and technological limitations of AR devices, operational deployment beyond prototypes has been constrained. Real-world, usability studies can explore barriers to implementation and improve system design. This paper details a mixed method usability case study of an AR head-mounted display (HMD) to perform a short, simple visual inspection task. Twenty-two participants from South Australian manufacturing businesses inspected a pump and pipe skid while working at height. Overall, workload demands for the task were considered acceptable and just below the “low” workload threshold (NASA Task Load Index, mean = 29.3) and the system usability was rated “average” (system usability scale, mean = 68.5). The results suggest the task did not place too high a burden on users and was an appropriate initial exposure to AR HMDs, but further refinement to the interface would be desirable before implementation to minimise frustration and promote learning. Users were enthusiastic and open-minded about the AR HMD although results indicate that even with recent advancements in AR HMD technology, interactions between the task, technology and environment continue to cause human and technical challenges—some of which are relatively straightforward to address but others are dependent on larger-scale efforts. © 2023 The Authors.

Augmented reality aided object mapping for worker assistance/training in an industrial assembly context: Exploration of affordance with existing guidance techniques,"In recent years, the affordances of immersive technologies in the industrial context have enabled the onsite worker to have increased potential towards handling the complex procedural and cognitive tasks involved in the strategy of manufacturing an appropriate product. This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Assembly; Augmented reality; Disassembly; Object mapping; Virtual reality,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2023,Journal,Eswaran M.; Raju Bahubalendruni M.V.A.,10.1016/j.cie.2023.109663
Anomaly Detection in the Metal-Textile Industry for the Reduction of the Cognitive Load of Quality Control Workers,"This paper presents an approach for reducing the cognitive load for humans working in quality control (QC) for production processes that adhere to the 6σ -methodology. While 100% QC requires every part to be inspected, this task can be reduced when a human-in-the-loop QC process gets supported by an anomaly detection system that only presents those parts for manual inspection that have a significant likelihood of being defective. This approach shows good results when applied to image-based QC for metal textile products. © 2023 ACM.",anomaly detection; datasets; neural networks; process optimization; quality control,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023,Conference,Arndt T.; Conzen M.; Elsen I.; Ferrein A.; Galla O.; Köse H.; Schiffer S.; Tschesche M.,10.1145/3594806.3596558
Decision Support for Flexible Manufacturing Systems: Application of the Cognitive Systems Engineering and Ecological Interface Design Approach,"We applied the cognitive systems engineering (CSE)/ecological interface design (EID) approach to the work domain of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). Work domain analyses (WDA) and activity analyses were conducted. Previous concerns regarding the suitability of CSE for FMS are addressed. Principles of EID (i.e., direct perception, direct manipulation, and visual momentum) were applied in designing an ecological interface for a flexible manufacturing system (EcoFlex). The critical links between the products of a WDA and the content of an ecological interface (a key innovation of EID) are made explicit. The evaluations of this interface were very positive across a wide variety of traditional and novel dependent variables (please see the companion manuscript). The overall success of this research program clearly demonstrates that the CSE/EID approach is capable of being applied to FMS. Contributions of this manuscript include both theoretical insights (defining properties of the FMS work domain, concrete examples of the principles of EID, critical links between CSE and EID, resolution of concerns about the overall framework) and practical applications (specific design solutions for FMS and similar work domains, and successful examples of the CSE/EID approach which can be studied and leveraged by students). © Copyright 2023, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",cognitive systems engineering; decision support; direct manipulation; direct perception; discrete manufacturing; distributed supervisory control systems; ecological interface design; flexible manufacturing systems; visual displays; visual momentum,Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making,2023,Journal,Bennett K.B.; Edman C.; Cravens D.; Jackson N.,10.1177/15553434221118976
Exploring the transformation of user interactions to adaptive human-machine interfaces,"Human-machine interfaces (HMI) facilitate communication between humans and machines, and their importance has increased in modern technology. However, traditional HMIs are often static and do not adapt to individual user preferences or behavior. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) have become increasingly important in providing personalized user experiences. Machine learning techniques have gained traction in User Experience (UX) research to provide smart adaptations that can reduce user cognitive load. This paper presents an ongoing exploration of a method for generating adaptive user interfaces by analyzing user interactions and contextual data. It also provides an illustrative example using Markov chains to predict the next step for users interacting with an app for an industrial mixing machine. Furthermore, the paper conducts an offline evaluation of the approach, focusing on the precision of the recommendations. The study emphasizes the importance of incorporating user interactions and contextual data into the design of adaptive HMIs, while acknowledging the existing challenges and potential benefits.  © 2023 ACM.",Adaptive user interfaces; HMI; Recommendation systems,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2023,Conference,Carrera-Rivera A.; Reguera-Bakhache D.; Larrinaga F.; Lasa G.,10.1145/3612783.3612807
Cognitive ergonomics-based Augmented Reality application for construction performance,"There is a growing interest in exploring the use of wearable Augmented Reality (AR) devices to improve the task performance of construction workers. However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Augmented reality; Cognitive ergonomics; Construction assembly task; Kinaesthetic performance,Automation in Construction,2023,Journal,Wu S.; Hou L.; Chen H.; Zhang G.K.; Zou Y.; Tushar Q.,10.1016/j.autcon.2023.104802
Development and Integration of a Workpiece-Based Calibration Method for an Optical Assistance System,"Assistance systems utilize a broad range of technologies to provide information and guidance to workers in manufacturing. The use of light projectors, as of today, has seldom been catalogued in the relevant literature, and the implementation of such is yet to be found in production environments. However, light projectors may offer a cost effective enhancement for production processes, especially within the context of large-scale workpieces. Of the pertaining literature, only one calibration algorithm is currently considered applicable, thus acting as a framework of motivation for this paper. A novel calibration algorithm based on Newton’s method is presented and validated in conjunction with a proof-of-concept demonstration of the resulting accuracy, as well as the integration of such into an interface based on Node-RED, with MQTT as the main protocol. © 2023 by the authors.",aircraft manufacturing; cognitive assistance system; industrial assistance system; Industry 4.0; light projector; moving head spot; Newton’s method,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2023,Journal,Koch J.; Büchse C.; Schüppstuhl T.,10.3390/app13137369
Software framework concept with visual programming and digital twin for intuitive process creation with multiple robotic systems,"With the progressive digitalization in industrial manufacturing, the usage of complex robotic systems in both intralogistics and production is expected to increase. This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program-synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the programming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in parallel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Digital twin; Human Robot Interaction; Human-machine interaction; Industry 4.0; Operator 4.0; Process Planning; Programming; Smart Manufacturing; Software architecture; User Centric Design; Visual programming,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,Niermann D.; Doernbach T.; Petzoldt C.; Isken M.; Freitag M.,10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102536
Guidelines for the integration of cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-centered and collaborative robotics applications,"In the context of Industry 4.0, cognitive ergonomics is crucial for improving the working conditions and the psychosocial well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart machines, as well as for the enhancement of production performances. Nevertheless, this topic is often neglected or ignored when implementing human-robot interaction in industrial settings. Starting from the results obtained from previous studies, this work proposes a structured process to develop and preliminarily validate a set of guidelines to support non-experts in human factors at the early stages of the design of human-centered and collaborative applications. A systematic analysis of the scientific literature has been performed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to identify relevant results on the topic. Successively, the guidelines have been developed starting from such an analysis by considering the target group and the final aim of the work. This phase involved the analysis, classification, summary, and abstraction of relevant statements and results from the selected articles, as well as the update of the previous set of guidelines. The guidelines have been preliminarily validated by an external team of researchers currently doing research in the field. Qualitative feedback on understandability and relevance has been collected to improve the guidelines before further investigations. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

An ergonomic role allocation framework for dynamic human–robot collaborative tasks,"By incorporating ergonomics principles into the task allocation processes, human–robot collaboration (HRC) frameworks can favour the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). In this context, existing offline methodologies do not account for the variability of human actions and states; therefore, planning and dynamically assigning roles in human–robot teams remains an unaddressed challenge. This study aims to create an ergonomic role allocation framework that optimises the HRC, taking into account task features and human state measurements. The presented framework consists of two main modules: the first provides the HRC task model, exploiting AND/OR Graphs (AOG)s, which we adapted to solve the allocation problem; the second module describes the ergonomic risk assessment during task execution through a risk indicator and updates the AOG-related variables to influence future task allocation. The proposed framework can be combined with any time-varying ergonomic risk indicator that evaluates human cognitive and physical burden. In this work, we tested our framework in an assembly scenario, introducing a risk index named Kinematic Wear. The overall framework has been tested with a multi-subject experiment. The task allocation results and subjective evaluations, measured with questionnaires, show that high-risk actions are correctly recognised and not assigned to humans, reducing fatigue and frustration in collaborative tasks. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Ergonomics; Human factors and human-in-the-loop; Human–robot teaming; Intelligent and flexible manufacturing,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2023,Journal,Merlo E.; Lamon E.; Fusaro F.; Lorenzini M.; Carfì A.; Mastrogiovanni F.; Ajoudani A.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.12.011
Human-Aware Goal-Oriented Autonomy through ROS-Integrated Timeline-based Planning and Execution,"Robots acting in real-world environments may interact with humans at different levels of abstraction (e.g., process, task, physical), entailing different control and coordination challenges. When acting in social situations, robots should be able to pursue (joint) goals by behaving according to the context as well as the skills/features of involved humans. Although reliable and effective, standard control techniques may limit the adaptability of robots. Novel control technologies based on Artificial Intelligence can endow robots with the cognitive capabilities needed to achieve a higher level of autonomy in terms of flexibility, reliability, and awareness. In this context, this paper introduces a goal-oriented acting framework based on timeline-based planning and execution. The framework is evaluated on a realistic Human-Robot Collaboration manufacturing scenario. Results show the capability of dealing with the uncontrollable dynamics of humans achieving effective and reliable collaborations. © 2023 IEEE.",,"IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication, RO-MAN",2023,Conference,Umbrico A.; Cesta A.; Orlandini A.,10.1109/RO-MAN57019.2023.10309516
How to provide work instructions to reduce the workers' physical and mental workload,"The transition to Industry 5.0 emphasizes the human-centric perspective and pushes for ergonomic risks prevention and mitigation. The diffusion of the production paradigms of mass customization and mass personalization also increases the need for methods and tools to support workers in manufacturing activities. The growing number of product variants requires a higher cognitive load and increases the likelihood of human errors. Work instructions become fundamental, as well as their digitalization. The technologies enabling industry 4.0 have opened up new scenarios for the use of this information, from extended reality to digital assistance systems. This work deals with the human-centered redesign of a workstation for the wire harness assembly with the aim of mitigating the ergonomic risks for operators, both physical and cognitive. Four different scenarios for using the work instructions were implemented and tested: paper-based instructions, workstation display, mixed reality application usable with a head-mounted display, and augmented reality application that only requires a projection system. The experimentation involved user experience evaluation, performance assessment, and objective postural analysis through inertial sensors. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A third eye to augment environment perception,Extending the human field of view could enhance our ability to perceive our surroundings thereby improving user safety and enabling us to perform complex manipulation tasks in industrial assembly processes. We investigated the augmentation of environment perception through a study that systematically measured the performance and perception arising from the use of a third eye placed on the back of the user's head in virtual reality. 28 participants were asked to conduct two goal-oriented tasks: One requiring the identification of targets that discretely appeared in a set of predefined locations; the other the catching of a continuously moving target. The results show that participants were able to incorporate the additional visual information in real time resulting in changes of their motion behaviour. These changes led to localised improvements in task performance for the discrete target task and more efficient motion for both tasks. Participants also showed a strong preference for performing the tasks with the third eye and perceived no accompanying increase in cognitive load. © 2023 IEEE.,,"IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication, RO-MAN",2023,Conference,Meara M.O.; Cheng X.; Eden J.; Ivanova E.; Burdet E.,10.1109/RO-MAN57019.2023.10309628
An Approach For Analysis Of Human Interaction With Worker Assistance Systems Based On Eye Tracking And Motion Capturing,"Human behavior in production systems influences productivity, product quality, work safety and overall process performance. To guide human behavior, digital worker assistance systems can be used to support cognitive decision tasks and sensory perception tasks. In doing so, the design of the assistance systems affects user experience and work results. To optimize and develop human-centric productions systems, data on human behavior and interaction with manufacturing equipment must be collected and analyzed. This analysis is expected to yield benefits regarding process monitoring, quality assurance, user experience and ergonomics. In addition, the results could be used for training purposes to monitor skill improvements. This paper presents a framework for data acquisition and analysis of human interaction with digital worker assistance systems. In addition to the overall system architecture, the individual development steps are discussed. An eye tracking device and a motion capturing camera are used for data collection and provide live information about human behavior in conjunction with a digital worker assistance system. The data is stored in a database and analyzed by custom analysis algorithms. The results are displayed in a dashboard application and show that the presented framework with eye tracking and motion capturing is suitable for the analysis of human interaction with worker assistance systems. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

From Human to Robot Interaction towards Human to Robot Communication in Assembly Systems,"The interaction between humans and robots has been a rapidly developing technology and a frequently discussed research topic in the last decade because current robots ensure the physical safety of humans during close proximity assembly operations. This interaction promises capability flexibility due to human dexterity skills and capacity flexibility due to robot accuracy. Nevertheless, in these interactions, the humans are marginally outside of the system, while the robots are seen as a crucial component of the assembly activities, which causes the systems to lack flexibility and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a study on Human to Robot communication in assembly systems. We conducted a systematic review of related literature and industrial applications involving human and robot interaction modes over the last decade to identify research gaps in the integration of collaborative robots into assembly systems. We believe that we are in a transformation phase from physical interaction mode towards cognitive interaction mode between humans and robots, where humans and robots are able to interact with each other during mutual working conditions and humans are able to guide robots. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a future mode of human-robot interaction in which a skilled operator performs not only physical cooperative tasks with robots but also work aided by smart technologies that allow communication with robots. This interaction mode allows for an increase in the flexibility and productivity of the assembly operation as well as t he wellbeing of the human operator in a human-centered manufacturing environment. © 2023 Published by ISRES Publishing: www.isres.org.",Human robot communication; Human robot interaction; Industry 4.0; Industry 5.0,"Eurasia Proceedings of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics",2023,Conference,Kambarov I.; Inoyatkhodjaev J.; Kunz D.; Brossog M.; Franke J.,10.55549/epstem.1365802
Mechatronic Coupling System for Cooperative Manufacturing with Industrial Robots,"Rising product variants and shortened product life cycles require more flexible and universally utilizable production systems and machines. Consequently, it can be expected that the importance of industrial robots in production will continuously increase, due to their suitability to take over the role of a universal production machine. However, robots are not yet able to fulfill this role. Industrial use of robots has so far been limited mainly to simple transport and handling tasks in the context of human-robot collaboration as well as highly repetitive automated tasks in the context of manufacturing and assembly. For universal use, robots must be capable to perform more demanding tasks in manufacturing with higher requirements on mechanical stiffness and accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a mechatronic system to couple two robots to a parallel kinematic system to temporarily increase the mechanical stiffness. The coupled state of the robots allows load sharing, higher process forces and eventually higher precision. The overall goal is to enable robots to perform more demanding manufacturing tasks and thus to be utilized in a wider range of applications. Design requirements, the development approach and optimization methods of the first coupling module prototype will be presented and discussed. The next development steps, a future demonstration system and possible use cases for the coupling module will be shown in the outlook. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

DATA FUSION COGNITIVE COMPUTING FOR CHARACTERIZATION OF MECHANICAL PROPERTY IN FRICTION STIR WELDING PROCESS,"High intricacy of the friction stir welding (FSW) process and severe plastic deformation typically result in serious part quality concerns, including thinning, groove, and kissing bond. These defects, in turn, impact mechanical properties (e.g., Young’s modulus and yield strength), thereby deteriorating the performance of a joint part. Machine learning methods such as feature-based support vector machines and end-to-end deep neural networks are recently coupled with in-situ sensing to link process parameters with the final properties, yet the low accuracy and precision, poor sample efficiency, and lack of interpretable learning limit their capabilities for reliable characterization. This research introduces hyperdimensional cognitive computing (HCC) that mimics human brain functionalities to fuse power, torque, and force data to provide robust, sample-efficient, and explainable learning for process-property characterization in FSW. Data augmentation is integrated with HCC to tackle the imbalanced data problem. The experimental results show that HCC seamlessly fuses in-situ data to predict the ultimate tensile strength with an F1-score of 0.899 ± 0.048, which is 21.579%, 47.779%, 1.933%, and 68.139% better than support vector machine, logistic regression, Naive-Bayes and multilayer perceptron, respectively. Besides the superior prediction capability, HCC symbolic representation reveals that measured force is the critical factor in the characterization of ultimate tensile strength. The proposed HCC is shown to be effective for data fusion and single-pass learning and eliminates the necessity of costly and long retraining in various manufacturing processes such as 3D printing and bio-fabrication.

Predicting Human-Robot Team Performance Based on Cognitive Fatigue,"Human-robot systems are increasingly employed across various industries, such as transportation, military, emergency response, and manufacturing. During human-robot collaboration, cognitive fatigue accumulation significantly impacts the human operator's performance, particularly in teleoperation and shared autonomy. This fatigue accumulation can be dangerous and may lead to incidents in robot operations. Consequently, modelling human performance is crucial for understanding and evaluating human-robot systems for risk mitigation and efficiency enhancement. In this work, we propose a prediction model for human-robot teams based on Fitts' Law and the SAFTE model. The model takes into account the operator's cognitive fatigue level and mission requirements to predict whether the operator is suitable for executing the mission and the time required for the human-robot team to complete it. Furthermore, we present a case study on a hypothetical scenario, drawing upon human study data, to assess the model's applicability. © 2023 IEEE.",cognitive fatigue; human-robot collaboration; performance prediction; robot safety,ICAC 2023 - 28th International Conference on Automation and Computing,2023,Conference,Wan Y.; Zhou C.,10.1109/ICAC57885.2023.10275262
Orbital Head-Mounted Display: A Novel Interface for Viewpoint Control during Robot Teleoperation in Cluttered Environments,"Robotic teleoperation is used in various applications, including the nuclear industry, where the experience and intelligence of a human operator are necessary for making complex decisions that are beyond the autonomy of robots. Human-robot interfaces that help strengthen an operators situational awareness without inducing excessive cognitive load are crucial to the success of teleoperation. This paper presents a novel visual interface that allows operators to simultaneously control a 6-DoF camera platform and a robotic manipulator whilst experiencing the remote environment through a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD). The proposed system, Orbital Head-Mounted Display (OHMD), utilizes head rotation tracking to command camera movement in azimuth and elevation directions around a fixation point located at a robot's end-effector. A human factor study was conducted to compare the interface acceptance, perceived workload, and task performance of OHMD with a conventional interface utilizing multiple fixed cameras (Array) and a standard head-mounted display implementation (HMD). Results show that both the OHMD and HMD interfaces significantly improve task performance, reduce perceived workload and increase interface acceptance compared to the Array interface. Participants reported they preferred OHMD due to the increased assistance and freedom in viewpoint selection. Whilst OHMD excelled in usefulness, the standard HMD interface allowed operators to perform robotic welding tasks significantly faster. © 2023 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,2023,Conference,Kuitert S.; Hofland J.; Heemskerk C.J.M.; Abbink D.A.; Peternel L.,10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341733
GAZE-BASED AUGMENTED REALITY INTERFACES FOR MICRO- AND MACRO-SCALE TASKS,Augmented Reality (AR) and gaze-based user interfaces (UI) can reduce a user’s cognitive load in both robotics and manufacturing applications. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a gaze-based AR system to assist users with an assembly task for future use in human-robot interaction (HRI) that is both scalable and benchmarked to determine its efficacy in different scales of environments and with different densities of AR-inclusive items. Testing includes analysis of the effects of a dense environment on the system. The system worked for all initial participants with qualitative positive feedback on the system. Constructive criticism focused on tailoring the dwell time to the individual. The results provide future developers with guidance to determine the practical density of an AR-inclusive environment.

A Systematic Approach to Task Assignment and Production Planning in Disassembly with Employee Skills,"An emerging shortage of resources fosters a development for strategies for the circularity of products and resources. Due to the different states of returned end-of-life products, the complexity for employees in disassembly increases. This work aims to provide an approach for an optimal allocation of disassembly tasks to individual employees and therefore enable a basis for planning and control in disassembly. At first, a task description is provided based on which a standardized time for operations is considered. Second, a link is created between the task description and the product state. Depending on the product state the time determined prior can be adjusted. Third, human skills are considered in manufacturing. It is assumed that within a production system there are different employees with different, developing skill sets. Based on specific skills, a task-to-person-is conducted. Using the information gathered, a Digital Twin (DT) that includes the human nature of the employees and their state is created to enable a simulation of tasks and thereby also a learning system for “first-time-seen” products. When facing complex tasks, the cognitive load and human's fatigue are decisive for performance and thereby the time required for execution. Completing these steps, a multistage concept is created that enables a more precise disassembly planning that can be shown in the case study on the example of components of electric vehicles. © 2023 The Authors.

This paper aims to answer the following question: how can the evolution of Workforce 4.0 job profiles be analyzed from a job-task perspective concerning the adoption of smart and digital technologies in manufacturing companies? To this end, it presents a task classification framework addressing three task classification dimensions, namely: (i) routine/nonroutine tasks, (ii) physical/cognitive tasks, and (iii) individual/social tasks, and a job-task analysis method to analyze the evolution of job profiles due to smart or digital technology adoption at the task level. Both artifacts were created using a state-of-the-art review to ground their conceptualization in the most recent knowledge available on work design and job-task analysis methods and were later evaluated and refined using an action-research approach to increase their applicability and usefulness for academic researchers and practitioners. The applicability of the proposed framework and method was demonstrated in an industrial case study discussing the theoretical and managerial contributions of these two artifacts for the development of Workforce 4.0 job profiles. It was concluded that the proposed framework and method are valuable artifacts that contribute to the limited universe of tools available in the literature to first analyze how operators’ tasks and roles change concerning the adoption of new Industry 4.0 technologies and then identify the requirements of new skills and competencies for the evolving and emerging job profiles on the shop floor. © 2023 by the authors.",Industry 4.0; job profile(s); job-task analysis; Operator 4.0; task allocation; task classification; Workforce 4.0,Sustainability (Switzerland),2023,Journal,Cimini C.; Romero D.; Pinto R.; Cavalieri S.,10.3390/su15053899
OSH related risks and opportunities for industrial human-robot interaction: results from literature and practice,"Robotic systems are an integral component of today’s work place automation, especially in industrial settings. Due to technological advancements, we see new forms of human-robot interaction emerge which are related to different OSH risks and benefits. We present a multifaceted analysis of risks and opportunities regarding robotic systems in the context of task automation in the industrial sector. This includes the scientific perspective through literature review as well as the workers’ expectations in form of use case evaluations. Based on the results, with regards to human-centred workplace design and occupational safety and health (OSH), implications for the practical application are derived and presented. For the literature review a selected subset of papers from a systematic review was extracted. Five systematic reviews and meta-analysis (492 primary studies) focused on the topic of task automation via robotic systems and OSH. These were extracted and categorised into physical, psychosocial and organisational factors based on an OSH-factors framework for advanced robotics developed for the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA). To assess the workers’ perspective, 27 workers from three European manufacturing companies were asked about their expectations regarding benefits and challenges of robotic systems at their workplace. The answers were translated and categorised in accordance with the framework as well. The statements, both from literature and the survey were then analysed according to the qualitative content analysis, to gain additional insight into the underlying structure and trends in them. As a result, new categories were formed deductively. The analysis showed that the framework is capable to help categorise both findings from literature and worker survey into basic categories with good interrater reliability. Regarding the proposed subcategories however, it failed to reflect the complexity of the workers’ expectations. The results of the worker evaluation as well as literature findings both predominantly highlight the psychosocial impact these systems may have on workers. Organisational risks or changes are underrepresented in both groups. Workers’ initial expectations lean towards a positive impact.

Evaluating Cognitive Load Assistance System in an Industry 5.0 Environment,"Manual assembly environments featuring the new Industry 5.0 concepts feature higher complexity, mass customization and less linear assembly lines, increasing expectations and demands on the human operator. Cognitive assistance systems can be implemented to provide information and support learning in real time. They help the user with information processing and with work execution. Providing a cognitive load assistance system can contribute to reducing the cognitive load exerted on manual assembly workers. This effort describes an evaluation of a Manual Assembly 5.0 Cognitive Load Assistance System, in the form of work instruction delivery methods. Participants were tasked with performing a manual assembly process using LEGO® bricks and taking and recording measurements, and then executing a 3D printing command for a predesigned SOLIDWORKS® model. The study simulated some of the major Industry 5.0 elements, including a single workstation with one worker, both pure manual and hybrid assembly production, a coding interface to automate the robot, controlled ergonomic settings, and mass customization. Eye tracking measurements, performance and NASA-TLX scores were used for evaluation of cognitive workload. Preliminary results show a difference in workload variables of fixation duration and NASA-TLX scores. © IISE and Expo 2023.All rights reserved.",cognitive workload; eye-tracking; Industry 5.0; manual assembly,IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2023,2023,Conference,Hamarsheh D.; Roca A.M.; Fendley M.,10.21872/2023IISE_3118
An AR-assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning-based approach towards mutual-cognitive safe human-robot interaction,"With the emergence of Industry 5.0, the human-centric manufacturing paradigm requires manufacturing equipment (robots, etc.) interactively assist human workers to deal with dynamic and complex production tasks. To achieve symbiotic human–robot interaction (HRI), the safety issue serves as a prerequisite foundation. Regarding the growing individualized demand of manufacturing tasks, the conventional rule-based safe HRI measures could not well address the safety requirements due to inflexibility and lacking synergy. To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview and collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Augmented reality; Deep reinforcement learning; Human robot interaction; Manufacturing safety; Smart manufacturing,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,Li C.; Zheng P.; Yin Y.; Pang Y.M.; Huo S.,10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102471
Effects of cognitive load on human cognitive reliability,"Human error is the main factor that causes aviation accidents. So far, the human factor has remained the main contributor to flight accidents. As the first generation of HRA(Human Reliability Analysis) methods, HCR(Human Cognitive Reliability) model has been verified in multiple industries. The level of cognitive load of a pilot directly affects his flight performance. However, the current three correction factors of the HCR model are not sufficient for a comprehensive assessment of the failure probability of pilot operations. Therefore, cognitive load is introduced as the fourth correction factor of the HCR model in this paper. The HCR model is modified by experimental measurement parameters, and the accuracy of the modified model was proved by verification experiments.  © 2023 IEEE.",cognitive workload; human cognitive reliability; human error,"Proceedings - 2023 11th International Conference on Information Systems and Computing Technology, ISCTech 2023",2023,Conference,Yu H.; Xue H.; Li J.; Fan W.,10.1109/ISCTech60480.2023.00047

The Applications of Human Factors and Ergonomics Principles in the Healthcare Industry in the Face of the COVID-19 Epidemic: A Review.,"This paper aims to identify and synthesize critical organizational solutions from a human factors and ergonomics (HFE) perspective in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, this paper reviews published literature that discusses HFE measures undertaken by healthcare industry practitioners to ensure safety and required organizational performance levels in response to COVID-19. To overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to understand how the HFE discipline can contribute to various levels of crisis management, from organizational preparation and planning to intervention implementation and analysis. A critical review and qualitative synthesis of published literature were employed to gather knowledge of relevant organizational human factors and ergonomics interventions to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review's findings revealed several critical success factors that impact HFE applications in healthcare systems regarding the mitigation and management of COVID-19 pandemic effects. These factors include creating wellness teams composed of psychologists and medical experts, providing consultation services for the mental health of employees targeted by COVID-19, creating a safety culture of effective leadership to communicate the psychological burdens and burnout, mitigating the effects of the increased cognitive loading on healthcare workers, and clarifying team member roles. Other identified success factors include well-defined organizational policies, implementation of lessons learned from infection incidents, building a safety culture that incorporates transparency, clear policies for healthcare tools procurement, and the need for unity among government, healthcare organizations, and healthcare personnel to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. © IISE and Expo 2023.All rights reserved.",COVID-19; Healthcare; HFE; Organizational Ergonomics; Pandemic,IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2023,2023,Conference,,10.21872/2023IISE_1854
On Semi-Autonomous Robotic Telemanipulation Employing Electromyography Based Motion Decoding and Potential Fields,"Telemanipulation is widely used in robotics applications, ranging from maintenance of various industrial systems to search and rescue response in remote and/or hazardous environments. Human operators are often responsible for the control of such robotic systems. However, these remote interactions require highly trained and experienced operators owing to their complex nature. Semi-autonomous systems are presented as an alternative to complex and counter-intuitive manual systems, combining decoded user intentions with autonomous control modules. This paper proposes a semi-autonomous framework for robotic telemanipulation that employs Electromyography (EMG) based motion decoding and potential fields to execute complex object stacking tasks with a dexterous robot arm-hand system. Even though simple EMG-based teleoperation is promising, the signals are often noisy leading to induced randomness and control errors. To assist the user during task executions, potential fields are utilized to avoid obstacles and guide the robot end-effector toward the objects of interest, thus reducing the cognitive load on the user and the need for accurate predictions. The user's motion is decoded from the myoelectric activations of the human upper arm and upper torso using a Random Forest-based regression methodology. The objects are detected in the environment with an external camera that provides their goal poses to the potential fields scheme. EMG control and potential fields work in a synergistic manner simplifying the system's operation. The framework performance is experimentally validated in real-time experiments involving complex cube and cylinder stacking tasks. © 2023 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,2023,Conference,Guan B.; Godoy R.V.; Sanches F.; Dwivedi A.; Liarokapis M.,10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342155
Explainability as the key ingredient for AI adoption in Industry 5.0 settings,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention as a means to address the transparency and interpretability challenges posed by black box AI models. In the context of the manufacturing industry, where complex problems and decision-making processes are widespread, the XMANAI platform emerges as a solution to enable transparent and trustworthy collaboration between humans and machines. By leveraging advancements in XAI and catering the prompt collaboration between data scientists and domain experts, the platform enables the construction of interpretable AI models that offer high transparency without compromising performance. This paper introduces the approach to building the XMANAI platform and highlights its potential to resolve the “transparency paradox” of AI. The platform not only addresses technical challenges related to transparency but also caters to the specific needs of the manufacturing industry, including lifecycle management, security, and trusted sharing of AI assets. The paper provides an overview of the XMANAI platform main functionalities, addressing the challenges faced during the development and presenting the evaluation framework to measure the performance of the delivered XAI solutions. It also demonstrates the benefits of the XMANAI approach in achieving transparency in manufacturing decision-making, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and machines, improving operational efficiency, and optimizing business value.

Redesign of manufacturing workstation with value sensitive design and axiomatic design to incorporate values of industry 5.0,"Industry 5.0 arises as a logical advance of Industry 4.0 to enhance the values that were being gradually abandoned due to the rapid technological advancement. These values focus on the human being, the sustainability and the continuity of the industrial system become the main objectives to be maintained during the development of the new smart industry model. These objectives allow the design of work environments within Industry 5.0 that ensure the adaptation of workers to technologies of Industry 4.0, in a sustainable way and that strengthen a resilient industrial system. In the present work the use of Value Sensitive Design (VSD) methodology for the redesign of manufacturing workplace in accordance with the values established by the Industry 5.0 is proposed. In this process, the VSD tripartite methodology allows to maintain the values of Industry 5.0 throughout the design process. Moreover, the integration of this methodology with the Axiomatic Design (AD) allows to achieve specific design parameters that meet the needs of the different stakeholders. The application of this model seeks the development of symbiotic work environments, in which workers increase their different physical, sensory and cognitive abilities with advanced technologies. The design of a work environment following the proposed model promotes a social smart industrial environment in which the safety and health of workers is ensured. © 2023 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.",Augmented Reality; Axiomatic Design; Industry 5.0; Social Smart Industry; Value Sensitive Design,Advances in Science and Technology,2023,Conference,Agote-Garrido A.; Martín-Gómez A.; Lama-Ruiz J.R.,10.4028/p-1R6Oiz

DeFACT in ManuVerse for Parallel Manufacturing: Foundation Models and Parallel Workers in Smart Factories,"In cyber-physical-social systems, smart manufacturing has to overcome challenges, such as uncertainty, diversity, complexity in modeling, long-delayed responses to market changes, and human engineer dependency. DeFACT is a framework of parallel manufacturing in ManuVerse where the Decentralized Autonomous Organization-based interactions between parallel workers consisting of robotic, digital, and human workers are elaborated to transform from professional division to real-virtual division. In DeFACT, human workers are only responsible for 5% physical and mental work that is complex and creative, and the robotic and digital workers can take care of the rest. The perceptual and cognitive intelligence of digital workers are intensified by a manufacturing foundation model (MF-PC), where calibration and certification (C&C), and verification and validation (V&V) guarantee not only the accuracy of task models, but also the interpretability and controllability of feature learning. As a case study, the workflow of customized shoes of SANBODY Technology Company is illustrated to show how DeFACT breaks the time and space constraints, avoids production waste caused by aesthetic discrepancies with consumers, and truly realizes flexible manufacturing.  © 2013 IEEE.",and parallel execution (ACP); Artificial systems; computational experiments; cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs); decentralized autonomous organization (DAO); ManuVerse; parallel manufacturing; smart manufacturing,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",2023,Journal,Yang J.; Li S.; Wang X.; Lu J.; Wu H.; Wang X.,10.1109/TSMC.2022.3228817
Effects of Robotic Expertise and Task Knowledge on Physical Ergonomics and Joint Efficiency in a Human-Robot Collaboration Task,"With the trend of low batch manufacturing, more and more small and medium enterprises are leaning towards adopting collaborative robots to increase productivity and improve operator well-being. However, robots are often programmed by robot experts rather than the operators effectively working with the machine. Therefore, operators may perceive low levels of task autonomy due to the unpredictability of robot motions. Empowering operators to make their own choices regarding robot motions can improve such feelings. However, research in cognitive science shows that allowing operators to decide on robot motions in a collaborative task could be influenced by how people consider their travel path and their partner's action. To better understand these relations, considering preliminary results from a previous study, we designed a user study where we tested operators' decisions in a collaborative task where groups of robot experts and novices were asked to choose their preferred task configuration among four possible options that differed in terms of operators' physical ergonomics and robot travel path. Our results show that robotic experts prioritize joint team work rather than their ergonomics. Contrarily, novices prioritize individual efforts and tend to reduce the robot travel path while keeping their travel path constant, maintaining good physical ergonomics. In conclusion, providing operators with task decision autonomy can be advantageous, but operator background must be considered to ensure optimal physical ergonomics and travel paths. © 2023 IEEE.",coordination; decision making; joint action; physical ergonomics; robotic expertise,IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots,2023,Conference,Pantano M.; Curioni A.; Regulin D.; Kamps T.; Lee D.,10.1109/Humanoids57100.2023.10375163
Human-robot teaming in construction: Evaluative safety training through the integration of immersive technologies and wearable physiological sensing,"Occupational safety has become a major issue in the construction industry over the years. Studies have shown that work-related accidents are mostly caused by the unsafe behaviors of construction workers, implying that they can be avoided with the appropriate safety training. With emerging technologies being increasingly implemented in the construction industry, there is a growing need to improve pedagogical techniques to equip workers with the multidisciplinary skills required to safely accomplish construction tasks. Construction robots are fine examples of such technologies that necessitate more effective training, as their adoption in the field is closely tied to workers’ safety. However, there is a lack of robust safety training methods for working with robots that can ensure the effectiveness of the training process. To address this issue, this study proposes a virtual avatar-based training platform for collaborating with construction robots. The proposed training platform uses workers' physiological signals to evaluate the training process throughout a human-robot collaboration (HRC) task. Using a deep neural network architecture, workers' cognitive load, a crucial factor of effective learning, was identified and linked to safety performance during the HRC task. The study results highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed training platform and its capability to evaluate the cognitive load during the HRC training in construction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cognitive load; Human-robot collaboration; Immersive environments; Physiological sensing; Safety training; Training evaluation,Safety Science,2023,Journal,Shayesteh S.; Ojha A.; Liu Y.; Jebelli H.,10.1016/j.ssci.2022.106019
Quantifying the Impact of XR Visual Guidance on User Performance Using a Large-Scale Virtual Assembly Experiment,"The combination of Visual Guidance and Extended Reality (XR) technology holds the potential to greatly improve the performance of human workforces in numerous areas, particularly industrial environments. Focusing on virtual assembly tasks and making use of different forms of supportive visualisations, this study investigates the potential of XR Visual Guidance. Set in a web-based immersive environment, our results draw from a heterogeneous pool of 199 participants. This research is designed to significantly differ from previous exploratory studies, which yielded conflicting results on user performance and associated human factors. Our results clearly show the advantages of XR Visual Guidance based on an over 50% reduction in task completion times and mistakes made; this may further be enhanced and refined using specific frameworks and other forms of visualisations/Visual Guidance.

Towards Mutual-Cognitive Human-Robot Collaboration: A Zero-Shot Visual Reasoning Method,"Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is showing the potential of widespread application in today's human-centric smart manufacturing, as prescribed by Industry 5.0. To enable safe and efficient collaboration, numerous visual perception methods have been explored, which allows the robot to perceive surroundings and plan collision-free, reactive manipulations. However, current visual perception approaches can only convey basic information between robots and humans, falling short of semantic knowledge. With this limitation, HRC cannot guarantee smooth operation when confronted with similar yet unseen situations in real-world applications. Therefore, a mutual-cognitive HRC architecture is proposed to plan human and robot operations based on the learning of knowledge representation of onsite situations and task structures. A zero-shot visual reasoning approach is introduced to derive suitable teamwork strategies in the mutual-cognitive HRC from perceived results, including human actions and detected objects. It assigns adaptive robot path planning and knowledge support for humans by incorporating perception components into a knowledge graph, even when dealing with a new but similar HRC task. Lastly, the significance of the proposed mutual-cognitive HRC system is revealed through its evaluation in collaborative disassembly tasks of aging electric vehicle batteries.  © 2023 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering,2023,Conference,Li S.; Zheng P.; Xia L.; Wang X.V.; Wang L.,10.1109/CASE56687.2023.10260599
"HUMAN FACTORS, PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS, EMOTIONS, WHAT ELSE?","This paper describes an activity carried out as part of a University's Summer on Campus program, which aimed to introduce high school students to the field of Human Factors. The program is designed to provide non-formal education activities in various scientific areas, being Human Factors in Engineering a crucial area of study that considers the individual, functionality, expectations, and impact of the end result while studying human emotions involved in cognitive processes like decision-making and perception. As Industry 5.0 emphasizes the importance of human involvement and collaboration with advanced technologies, it is crucial to understand and identify human responses to better understand human behavior. After the introduction to the topic of Human Factors and their importance for sustainability, several participatory and dynamic pedagogical activities were developed, including the collection of physiological data from high school students (n=12) in a noninvasive way and after obtaining informed consent from their educational guardians, including GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) and ECG (electrocardiogram) signals. The importance of Human Factors in Engineering, the pedagogical approach used, the students' attitudes and opinions regarding the set of Human Factors activities, and the lessons learned when approaching this topic with high school students are presented. The results indicated that the students were engaged and interested in the activities and showed an improved understanding of Human Factors and their importance in sustainability. Overall, this activity demonstrated the importance of introducing high school students to Human Factors, as it can help them develop a better understanding of human behavior, decision-making, and perception. By providing engaging and participatory activities, it is possible to foster interest and curiosity in this field, leading to future careers and research opportunities in Human Factors and related areas.  © 2023 by ASME.",Education; Human-centric; Human-Factors Engineering; Industry 5.0; Physiological measures,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2023,Conference,Leão C.P.; Loureiro I.; Silva V.; Costa S.P.,10.1115/IMECE2023-111516
Towards Multimodal Information Systems for Assisting Humans in Production and Logistics Processes,"Information support systems for coping with and mastering increasing process complexity are becoming a success factor for many companies. The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0. © 2023 The Authors.

"Assessing the Relationship between Cognitive Workload, Workstation Design, User Acceptance and Trust in Collaborative Robots","Collaborative robots are revolutionising the manufacturing industry and the way workers perform their tasks. When designing shared workspaces between robots and humans, human factors and ergonomics are often overlooked. This study assessed the relationship between cognitive workload, workstation design, user acceptance and trust in collaborative robots. We combined subjective and objective data to evaluate the cognitive workload during an assembly task in three different scenarios in which we manipulated various features of the workstation and interaction modalities. Our results showed that participants experienced a reduction in cognitive workload in each of the three trials, indicating an improvement in cognitive performance. Additionally, we found that user acceptance predicted perceived stress across the trials but did not significantly impact the cognitive workload. Trust was not found to moderate the relationship between cognitive workload and perceived stress. This study has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of collaborative assembly systems by providing valuable insights and helping to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners. This study can potentially impact companies looking to improve safety, productivity and efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.",cognitive workload; human–robot collaboration; technology acceptance; trust; workstation,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2023,Journal,Panchetti T.; Pietrantoni L.; Puzzo G.; Gualtieri L.; Fraboni F.,10.3390/app13031720
Social Analysis on the Education and Training Conditions Required by the Transformation to Digital and Green Fabrication,"Education and Training represent the principal means through which individuals acquire skills and competences. And it is through participation in continuous professional development and learning that adults will access, on an ongoing basis, the upskilling and reskilling necessary to adapt to the continuous changes. The paper analyses the gathered information (Delphi analysis using specific surveys) that is necessary for the harmonization of the knowledge involved in the transition to the digital and green manufacturing. The analysis was applied to information received from specialists in fabrication from 5 EU countries, with different levels of industrial development: Belgium, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Slovenia. According to the analysis, the majority of the responders (75%) did not receive training in digital and green activities in the past 6 months, 69% have participated in digital training. The companies which started the transformation to digital fabrication, use CAD-CAM followed by Enterprise resource planning (ERP), Production and Quality Management systems, communications tools and in a minor scale Robotic production technology, simulation tools and virtual programming digital monitoring. One of the problems identified with this survey was related to lack of digital skills experienced by the surveyed participant (44%) and lack of knowledge in digital training on the part of withe and blue co-workers (almost 80% in total). In terms of the use different digital technologies for the part of the companies it is equilibrated in terms of social media and Collaborative Technologies (30%); Data and Analytics (26%); Mobile Technologies (27%) and Cloud Computing Services (17%). The second part of the Delphi analysis was related on how to engage learners and help them to meet course and programme learning outcomes. Engagement entails includes mindfulness, intrinsic motivation, cognitive effort, and attention. To start with it was important to understand the way teaching/learning should be carried out, and the majority of the participants believed that Hybrid, online and face to face combined lectures are the best learning method, in terms of type of lesson, the short courses between 30-45 min were the most voted option (55%), followed by traditional 45 min lessons (30%). © 2023 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.",Delphi analysis; digital education; digital green fabrication; digital manufacturing technologies,Advances in Science and Technology,2023,Conference,Cecilia F.M.; Cătălin C.M.; Vasile S.S.; Ines P.A.; Barbara G.; Damjan K.; Uros T.; Alin S.N.; Robert F.; Maria S.A.,10.4028/p-BPY75g
Analysis of human factors affecting seafarers' cognitive load on maritime safety,"For the shipping industry with a large number of seafarers, human factor is the key to the shipping safety. However, the current research on human error identification of maritime accidents and seafarers' management neglects the influence of the relationship between human cognitive load and safety behavior. It is of great significance to the safety monitoring and management of the seafarers on duty. Therefore, from the perspective of ensuring the safety management of maritime transportation, this paper analyzes the factors that affect the cognitive load of seafarers from three aspects: individual factors, environmental factors, ship and shore organization. The data of cognitive load and its influencing factors of 987 inland river seafarers are collected by questionnaire survey, and the relationship between the influencing factors and cognitive load is reflected by logistic regression model. The results show that the formation of seafarers' cognitive load is multi-dimensional, mainly affected by family care, fatigue, psychological condition, mount guard emotion, ship environment and overtime work. Subsequent studies on the cognitive load and workload of seafarers should consider physiological and psychological conditions, task difficulty, navigation environment and other multi-dimensional conditions. The findings provide theoretical basis for maritime seafarers' safety management, such as safety risk monitoring, recruitment and selection process, and training for certification of seafarer competency.

One proposed solution is the telexistence system. However, required human resources still needs to be improved in telexistence robot system. Efforts to enable a single operator to control multiple robots simultaneously have been undertaken, but this approach presents a high cognitive load, and its practicality needs additional improvement. Consequently, we suggest a strategy where only a single robot is remotely managed by one operator while the remaining robots function autonomously. A key issue within this system is facilitating cooperation between the human-operated robot and the autonomous ones. In this study, we introduce a collaborative conveyance method as a application of this cooperative system, in both cases where information sharing among robots are poossible or not. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method through simulation experiments. © 2023 IEEE.",Coordinated Transportation; Remote Operation; Telexistence,IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference),2023,Conference,Ajisaka S.; Suda T.; Akazawa Y.; Nakamura S.,10.1109/IECON51785.2023.10311733
Addressing the Issues and Developments Correlated with Envisaged 5G Mobile Technologies: Comprehensive Solutions,"Fifth Generation (5G) communications are regarded as the cornerstone to household consumer experience improvements and smart manufacturing revolution from the standpoint of industries’ objectives. It is anticipated that Envisaged 5G (E5G) mobile technology would be operational in certain developed countries by 2023. The Internet of Things (IoTs) will transform how humans live when combined with smart and integrated sensing devices, such as in-home sensing devices. Recent research is being carried out all over the world to produce a new technique that can be crucial in the success of the anticipated 5G mobile technology. High output, reduced latency, highly reliable, greater scalability, high performance, capacity, bandwidth efficiency, virtual open-air transmission, and efficient energy mobile wireless communications are all being investigated currently.

Prospect-theoretic Modeling of Team Cognition for Task Allocation Towards Human-automation Symbiosis,"Collaboration between human and automation agents is identified essential for improving human-automation team performance, and task allocation is the direct operation that influences it during human-automation interaction. While conventional task allocation does not consider human-related factors in problem formulation, this paper proposes to include team cognitive performance in the optimization objective to allow adaptation to human agent states, thus facilitating human-automation symbiosis. To achieve this objective, this paper models different human-related factors during task allocation, including individual cognitive states, human trust, and level of automation. Team cognitive performance is proposed to be evaluated through cognitive load, confidence, and attention, which is used for team performance evaluation. Based on this, the team cognition-aware task allocation problem is formulated, and a two-dimensional genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. A validation case in manufacturing assembly is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2023 IEEE.",Genetic Algorithm; Human-automation Interaction; Human-automation Symbiosis; Task Allocation; Team Cognition,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, IEEM 2023",2023,Conference,Wang S.; Song M.; Fei Y.; Zhang D.; Zhou F.; Gebraeel N.; Jiao J.,10.1109/IEEM58616.2023.10406811
Generation and retrieval of procedural memory using natural intelligence for an articulated robot,"This article presents the basics of a working framework to emulate the cognitive function of procedural learning found in natural intelligence to aid in kinematic decision making in a robot. This contrasts with pure iterative recursion or regression techniques. Articulated robots comprise of only rotary joints with a stationary or mobile base reference to the world and are useful in manufacturing, maintenance, and operations to make labor intensive work easier for humans. The motivation for this work is to utilize the potential of cybernetic automation systems to keep up with scaling demands in supply chain production and further build sustainable means to support our growth in the future. In this research a robot is modelled for the process of calculating actuation commands from a starting point in the Euclidean task space to a target. This is known as Inverse Kinematics (IK), named in distinction to Forward Kinematics (FK) which calculates where a point on the robot will be in the task space, for a predefined set of joint positions. We aim to cover the gap in research to connect the development of procedural memory to path planning for a link manipulator robot. We ask the question, if there is any benefit of using procedural memory to reduce the calculation time taken for inverse kinematics to predict a path.  © 2023 IEEE.",natural intelligence; procedural memory; robotic automation,"2023 International Conference on IT Innovation and Knowledge Discovery, ITIKD 2023",2023,Conference,Chattoraj S.; Kalganova T.,10.1109/ITIKD56332.2023.10100232
Modelling and coordination of building design: an experience of BIM learning/upskilling,"The implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry requires multidisciplinary teams equipped with new technical and managerial skills. Professionals that are inexperienced or unfamiliar with the BIM design process face difficulties in transposing complex concepts into BIM modelling and coordination practices, despite governments, industry bodies, and academia's efforts. With this issue in mind, this article's objective is to present the teaching-learning strategies and tools adopted in a practical case of modelling an existing building on a BIM platform. In terms of method, a phenomenological approach has been taken to report on an exploratory didactic experience. The Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) was used to assess learning based on the authors’ perceptions. The research has been structured into the following five stages: Literature Review; Analysis of Brazilian and International BIM Standards and Guides; Didactic exercise; Experience Assessment; and Conclusions. The results reveal aspects of BIM processes that can be widely investigated in an academic environment, such as the BIM design and coordination process model, which can be explored as a tool in the BIM teaching-learning process. Also, difficulties related to teaching BIM management processes were identified, thus calling for different didactic approaches. The contributions made by the research come from reporting and analysing the process of learning complex BIM content from the perspective of inexperienced professionals. The work also contributes to the field through the BIM learning assessment proposal and the BIM process model resulted from the authors’ practical experience. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",BIM coordination; federated model; learning; Project disciplines,Architectural Engineering and Design Management,2023,Journal,de Souza M.P.; Fialho B.C.; Ferreira R.C.; Fabricio M.M.; Codinhoto R.,10.1080/17452007.2021.1970506
A Cognitive Assistance System To Support The Implementation Of Machine Learning Applications In Manufacturing,"Despite the increasing spread of digitalisation in manufacturing, humans will still play an important role in future production environments. Evidently, their role will change from physical to rather cognitive tasks, such as decision-making or control and monitoring of processes. A suitable medium that can support employees in interpreting the data generated are machine learning (ML) applications. Nevertheless, recent studies show that the knowledge required to implement an ML solution is not available in a large number of companies. In order to close the knowledge gap and subsequently prepare human operators for the implementation and use of ML applications, it is highly relevant to provide proper assistance. For this reason, the present publication aims to develop a cognitive assistance system that supports shop floor managers in implementing ML use cases in manufacturing (referred to as CAS-ML). The CAS-ML concretizes a previously published procedure model with additional steps as well as learning material and is realized as a software thereupon. Finally, the CAS-ML is evaluated by operative employees and tested on an open-source data set. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

A framework for human-centered production planning and control in smart manufacturing,"Smart manufacturing systems have to meet high performance expectations in form of customer individual products, short lead times, high due date reliability and resilience by the integration of new technologies and by intelligent process design. The planning and control of such smart manufacturing systems necessitates several instances of human decision-making. The latest research at the nexus of operations management and psychology reveals that human decision-making in such fast-paced, dynamic and complex environments is often biased, resulting in suboptimal operational performance. Human-centered design of planning and control processes can mitigate biased decisions, thus boosting performance in smart manufacturing systems. Current research is silent about the impact and mitigation of cognitive biases in operations management, though. We intend to close this research gap. We combine systematic reviews of literature on behavioral operations management and cognitive biases in operations management, particularly in production planning and control with an in-depth case study based on 12 expert interviews. We explore two decision-making models and combine them in a PPC framework. We create a framework for human-centered PPC in smart manufacturing systems, which includes the main impact factors, challenges and performance capabilities. Based on a detailed case study of a steel producer, we present a framework of human-centered PPC comprising five hypotheses on the impact of cognitive biases on human decision-making and on manufacturing performance. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Behavioural operations management; Cognitive biases; Decision support systems; Decision types; Production planning and control; Smart manufacturing,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,Kessler M.; Arlinghaus J.C.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.09.013
Essential Individual and Organizational Decision-Making for Smart Manufacturing,"Essential skills for worker success in smart manufacturing encompass not only technical skills, but also decision-making skills to be able to interact effectively with machines, software, and other humans. This multidisciplinary project brings together insights from experimental cognitive psychology research and qualitative field research to present a framework that identifies decision-making skills at the individual and organizational system levels for success in smart manufacturing. The cognitive psychology research indicated that human memory should be augmented during training with novel equipment to maximize human performance and retention of information. The field research revealed several essential decision-making factors for workers and organizations.

A human factors-aware assistance system in manufacturing based on gamification and hardware modularisation,"Assistance systems have been widely adopted in the manufacturing sector to facilitate various processes and tasks in production environments. However, existing systems are mostly equipped with rigid functional logic and do not provide individual user experiences or adapt to their capabilities. This work integrates human factors in assistance systems by adjusting the hardware and instruction presented to the workers’ cognitive and physical demands. A modular system architecture is designed accordingly, which allows a flexible component exchange according to the user and the work task. Gamification, the use of game elements in non-gaming contexts, has been further adopted in this work to provide level-based instructions and personalised feedback. The developed framework is validated by applying it to a manual workstation for industrial assembly routines. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",adaptive systems; assistance system; gamification; Human factors; manufacturing,International Journal of Production Research,2023,Journal,Ulmer J.; Braun S.; Cheng C.-T.; Dowey S.; Wollert J.,10.1080/00207543.2023.2166140
Physiological and perceptual consequences of trust in collaborative robots: An empirical investigation of human and robot factors,"Measuring trust is an important element of effective human-robot collaborations (HRCs). It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cognitive fatigue; ECG; Human-robot collaboration; Reliability; Sex; Trust,Applied Ergonomics,2023,Journal,Hopko S.K.; Mehta R.K.; Pagilla P.R.,10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103863
Cognitive dynamic digital twin: Enhancements for digital twin platforms based on human cognition,"Manufacturing has entered the fourth industrial revolution. Modern manufacturing is reliant on assets such as robotics and computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. To optimize the performance and value of these assets it would be wise to implement digital twin (DT) technology. DT technology has the ability to provide valuable services to owners of machine tools and other manufactruing assets. The current issue facing DTs is that they currently exist at a lower level of sophistication, meaning they are incapable of implementing more complex services. Cognitive dynamic systems (CDS) are a type of smart system based on human cognition which can augment the performance of many engineering systems. This paper proposes a framework of implementing aspects of CDSs to enable DTs to exist at a higher level of sophistication called the cognitive dynamic digital twin (CDDT). Examples exist in the literature of implementing cognitive based methods to improve DT services, they primarily implement artificial intelligence and estimation based methods. Most of these methods implement only one aspect of cognition at a time. In this work the CDDT framework was implemented to build a DT machine tool wear prediction service. The service was shown to be accurate at predicting the levels of wear in cutting tools. This service utilizing the CDDT framework used each of the aspects of human cognition to augment its performance. This framework can be used by many different sorts of DTs to improve their level of sophistication. © 2023 SPIE.",Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Condition monitoring; Digital twin; Smart systems,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023,Conference,Sicard B.S.; Butler Q.; Ziada Y.; Gadsden S.A.,10.1117/12.2664017
In-situ or side-by-side? A user study on augmented reality maintenance instructions in blind areas,"In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) has been effectively proposed as a tool to support workers in manual procedural tasks in industry, such as assembly and maintenance. It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers’ performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Augmented reality; Blind area; Industrial operator support; Maintenance; Occlusion; Work instructions,Computers in Industry,2023,Journal,Laviola E.; Gattullo M.; Evangelista A.; Fiorentino M.; Uva A.E.,10.1016/j.compind.2022.103795
A Cognitive Assistant for Operators: AI-Powered Knowledge Sharing on Complex Systems,"Operating a complex and dynamic system, such as an agile manufacturing line, is a knowledge-intensive task. It imposes a steep learning curve on novice operators and prompts experienced operators to continuously discover new knowledge, share it, and retain it. In practice, training novices is resource-intensive, and the knowledge discovered by experts is not shared effectively. To tackle these challenges, we developed an AI-powered pervasive system that provides cognitive augmentation to users of complex systems. We present an AI cognitive assistant that provides on-the-job training to novices while acquiring and sharing (tacit) knowledge from experts. Cognitive support is provided as dialectic recommendations for standard work instructions, decision-making, training material, and knowledge acquisition. These recommendations are adjusted to the user and context to minimize interruption and maximize relevance. In this article, we describe how we implemented the cognitive assistant, how it interacts with users, its usage scenarios, and the challenges and opportunities.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",,IEEE Pervasive Computing,2023,Journal,Freire S.K.; Panicker S.S.; Ruiz-Arenas S.; Rusak Z.; Niforatos E.,10.1109/MPRV.2022.3218600
Empirical Analysis of Software Success Rate Forecasting During Requirement Engineering Processes,"Forecasting on success or failure of software has become an interesting and, in fact, an essential task in the software development industry. In order to explore the latest data on successes and failures, this research focused on certain questions such as is early phase of the software development life cycle better than later phases in predicting software success and avoiding high rework? What human factors contribute to success or failure of a software? What software practices are used by the industry practitioners to achieve high quality of software in their day-to-day work? In order to conduct this empirical analysis a total of 104 practitioners were recruited to determine how human factors, misinterpretation, and miscommunication of requirements and decision-making processes play their roles in software success forecasting. We discussed a potential relationship between forecasting of software success or failure and the development processes. We noticed that experienced participants had more confidence in their practices and responded to the questionnaire in this empirical study, and they were more likely to rate software success forecasting linking to the development processes. Our analysis also shows that cognitive bias is the central human factor that negatively affects forecasting of software success rate. The results of this empirical study also validated that requirements’ misinterpretation and miscommunication were the main causes behind software systems’ failure. It has been seen that reliable, relevant, and trustworthy sources of information help in decision-making to predict software systems’ success in the software industry. This empirical study highlights a need for other software practitioners to avoid such bias while working on software projects. Future investigation can be performed to identify the other human factors that may impact software systems’ success. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

UX assessment strategy to identify potential stressful conditions for workers,"The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance.

Concept and Integration of Knowledge Management in Assembly Assistance Systems,"The increasing diversity of variants and the high product complexity pose ever-greater challenges for manufacturing companies, especially in assembly. Therefore, assembly assistance systems are increasingly used to manage complexity in terms of guiding workers through assembly processes. Previous research work in this context has mainly focused on the assessment and improvement of typical assistance functions as well as their implementation. The integration of active knowledge management on both shopfloor and planning level illustrates a high potential for the extension and development of new assistance functions. However, the possibility of using informational assistance systems to implement active knowledge management in industrial assembly has not been sufficiently studied yet. Therefore, this paper firstly defines the main challenges of the integration, which are summarized in a negative cycle of knowledge management in assembly, and secondly describes the key requirements for knowledge management in conjunction with assembly assistance systems. Using these requirements, the paper finally presents a conceptual framework and the implementation in an informational assembly assistance system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

Computer Aided Design of Self-Learning Robotic System Using Imitation Learning,"Artificial intelligence (AI), imitation learning, big data, cloud and distributed computing, robotics cells, and information communication technology, are some of the key tools and elements of the future digital and smart manufacturing facility. There are a number of challenges that digital and smart manufacturing is facing, especially with the complication of AI (i.e., machine, deep and cognitive learning) algorithms, great amount of data to process, and essential complex coding required, which makes immediate changes needed in manufacturing facilities not straightforward. This is notable in small manufacturing cells which is an integrated part of future smart factories such manufacturing facilities are usually needed some annual and regular updates to meet the update in the design specifications of next generation of products. Imitation learning is offering a great opportunity to overcome these challenges and simplify such complications, where human skills, ability to perform specific tasks, knowledge, and talent could be transferred. This is conveying the knowledge, and skills transfer using imitation learning. However, smart manufacturing and industrial revolution needs robotics cells that has skills beyond this, especially when it comes to process optimisation. Therefore, deep imitation learning could come in to help in the development of self-learning robotic systems and cells. Of course with the powerful tools such as distributed computing, blockchain, cloud computing, edge computing, and 5G the collaboration between such self-learning robotic cells will be possible. This will certainly not eliminate human existence but will enhance the manufacturing environment. This paper is focused on presenting the outcomes of CAD simulation and modelling phase of the ongoing research programme that focused on developing a self-learning robotic system using imitation learning. CAD tools have been used and some initial results is presented. Further work is still undertaken, and this will focus on learning from more than one expert, optimisation, impact of dynamic manufacturing environment.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.",CNN; Imitation learning; Relu; Resnet-50; Self-learning robotic,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2022,Conference,Jadeja Y.; Shafik M.; Wood P.,10.3233/ATDE220564

After discussing the contribution that the wider human factors literature made to the investigation on mental models, I discuss the safety risks associated with motorists’ incomplete or faulty mental models of assistance systems.

Dynamic data physicalization by unimorph dielectric elastomer actuators,"Physicalization helps the user understand complex data intuitively. Especially when confronted with complex, multidimensional datasets as in the smart home environment, classic graphical user interfaces struggle to visualize data in a way compatible with the paradigm of Calm Technology and new means of displaying data need to be explored, to decrease the cognitive burden on the user. Shape changing interfaces (SCI) using smart materials can change their appearance under electrical stimuli and provide the means to physicalize the data found in the smart home from sensors, appliances or others. Within the scope of this work, a smart display using dielectric elastomer unimorph actuators (UDEA) is developed, which can be used to explore how dielectric elastomers (DE) can be used for an SCI. A dynamic model of previous work has been adapted to the updated geometry. Reproducible production of the actuators is one focus of the current work. A novel sheet-to-sheet process for manufacturing multilayer DE-laminates is presented. Manual processing of the laminates to actuators is described and effects of human error on actuator performance in this process is assessed and found to be low to ensure reproducible fabrication. Finally the system design is presented and discussed. The developed display allows controlling 15 independent shape changing devices and will allow to gain more knowledge about physicalization of data using DE actuators. © 2023 SPIE.",Dielectric elastomer; shape changing interface; smart home,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2023,Conference,Gareis M.; Çabuk O.; Maas J.,10.1117/12.2661518
Optimisation-driven design to explore and exploit the process–structure–property–performance linkages in digital manufacturing,"An intelligent manufacturing paradigm requires material systems, manufacturing systems, and design engineering to be better connected. Surrogate models are used to couple product-design choices with manufacturing process variables and material systems, hence, to connect and capture knowledge and embed intelligence in the system. Later, optimisation-driven design provides the ability to enhance the human cognitive abilities in decision-making in complex systems. This research proposes a multidisciplinary design optimisation problem to explore and exploit the interactions between different engineering disciplines using a socket prosthetic device as a case study. The originality of this research is in the conceptualisation of a computer-aided expert system capable of exploring process–structure–property–performance linkages in digital manufacturing. Thus, trade-off exploration and optimisation are enabled of competing objectives, including prosthetic socket mass, manufacturing time, and performance-tailored socket stiffness for patient comfort. The material system is modelled by experimental characterisation—the manufacturing time by computer simulations, and the product-design subsystem is simulated using a finite element analysis (FEA) surrogate model. We used polynomial surface response-based surrogate models and a Bayesian Network for design space exploration at the embodiment design stage. Next, at detail design, a gradient descent algorithm-based optimisation exploits the results using desirability functions to isolate Pareto non-dominated solutions. This work demonstrates how advanced engineering design synthesis methods can enhance designers’ cognitive ability to explore and exploit multiple disciplines concurrently and improve overall system performance, thus paving the way for the next generation of computer systems with highly intertwined material, digital design and manufacturing workflows.

Cognitive Load Recognition Based on T-Test and SHAP from Wristband Sensors,"The understanding of cognitive load plays a key role in increasing the potential of human-centric systems. Recently, cognitive load detection has attracted the attention of researchers. Competitions are being held and relevant data are being released in this regard. Managing cognitive load through wearable devices in daily life contributes, amongst others, to industrial safety. Wearable bands require high prediction results with less data because of their limited battery and processing power. Therefore, by detecting important features that characterize cognitive load, we aimed to obtain a high load detection classification accuracy using few features. In total, we detected 179 features such as heart rate variabilities, descriptive statistical, and frequency features. Important features were detected using the independent t-test and SHapley additive exPlanation (SHAP). Furthermore, an accuracy of 70.3% was obtained with only ten important features using the LightGBM classifier. Heart rate variability and galvanic skin response were used as the important features. Additionally, the discrete wavelet transform was used as a more important frequency-domain feature than the discrete cosine transform. The proposed cognitive load detection method achieved higher accuracy with fewer features using a lighter classifier than those reported by existing CogLoad data studies. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Cognitive Load; Mental Fatigue; SHAP; Stress; Wearable Sensors; XAI,Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences,2023,Journal,Kim J.-K.; Lee K.; Hong S.G.,10.22967/HCIS.2023.13.027
An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Industrial Tasks,"The ongoing trend toward Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary workplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production chain. Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing the operator's physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator's performance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for online assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate the workers’ attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers’ mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics in manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Assembly; Attention estimation; Cognitive ergonomics; Cognitive manufacturing; Stress detection,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2022,Journal,Lagomarsino M.; Lorenzini M.; De Momi E.; Ajoudani A.,10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102380
Distracted worker: Using pupil size and blink rate to detect cognitive load during manufacturing tasks,"This study sets out to extend the use of blink rate and pupil size to the assessment of cognitive load of completing common automotive manufacturing tasks. Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks. © 2022",Blink rate; Cognitive load; Manufacturing; Pupil size,Applied Ergonomics,2023,Journal,Biondi F.N.; Saberi B.; Graf F.; Cort J.; Pillai P.; Balasingam B.,10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103867
A multi-dimensional cognitive framework for cognitive manufacturing based on OAR model,"With the production system shifting to a multi-variety and small-batch production mode, the production process faces more user requirements, changes, and uncertainties. To solve the above problems, it is necessary to obtain the status and trend changes information and provide information support for the optimization of decision-making and dynamic adjustment of the production system. However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems. In addition, as a formal expression of information processing and knowledge learning process in cognitive informatics, the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model can effectively guide the construction of the production process cognitive mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cognitive framework based on OAR model of the human cognitive world for the dynamic cognitive needs of production system. The framework carries out dynamic cognition from the three dimensions of the manufacturing unit, production situation, and production system, and builds the continuous cognitive abilities from the three dimensions of analysis, decision-making, and learning. By integrating intelligent algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, a computable digital twin model is constructed as a carrier to provide the cognitive enabling technologies and capabilities for the production system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated by the developed computational digital twin platform. The computable digital twin platform provides the production system with important cognitive capabilities such as states perception, trend prediction, optimization decision-making, and knowledge learning, to support the dynamic cognition and optimization decision-making of the production system, and lay a technical foundation for adaptive production and cognitive manufacturing. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Cognitive framework; Cognitive manufacturing; Computable digital twin; Intelligent manufacturing; Multi-dimensional; OAR model,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,Jiang T.; Zhou J.; Zhao J.; Wang M.; Zhang S.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.09.019
Industry 5.0 and Operations Management - the Importance of Human Factors,"In this position paper, we highlight the importance of human factors, especially cognition, for operations management during the transition from Industry 4.0 to 5.0 and within. We argue that the increasing prevalence of (digital) technology and data for manufacturing operations urges human-centered approaches and solutions, as well - to enable efficient and effective operations that benefit from both humans' and technologies' strengths. To stress our point, we give examples from behavioral operations management where technology may both foster or mitigate deviations from rational decision-making. In addition, we show prospects of human-AI interaction and explainable AI, specifically by using visualizations, to improve operational performance. © 2023 IEEE.",behavioral manufacturing operations management; cognitive biases; human factors; Industry 5.0; visualizations,"Proceedings of IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium 2023, NOMS 2023",2023,Conference,Lindner F.; Reiner G.,10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154282
Effect of temperature reduction of the prefrontal area on accuracy of visual sustained attention,"Objectives. Detection of sensitive signs in many work environments with automated systems (aviation industry, flight safety tower, maritime industry, monitoring in the military industry, etc.) is essential and requires constant visual attention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of forehead cooling on the accuracy of stable visual attention. Methods. This interventional study was performed on 34 male students. The sampling method was a randomized block design. Subjects were assessed by demographic questionnaire, Snellen chart, Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and physiological and cognitive measurements. Results. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) cooling caused significant changes in sublingual temperature during four measurements in the intervention group. There were no significant changes in heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and saturation of peripheral oxygen (%SpO2) between the two groups. The critical flicker frequency (CFF) as an indicator of cognitive fatigue showed that cognitive improvement after PFC cooling occurred following a reduction in cognitive fatigue. Conclusions. Considering the importance of choosing non-invasive methods to improve the operator’s cognitive skills while performing cognitive tasks in the field of neuroergonomics, it can be concluded that PFC cooling is an effective and safe way to improve some cognitive skills such as visual attention. © 2022 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).",flicker fusion threshold; hemoencephalography; neuroergonomics; sustained attention; visual attention,International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics,2023,Journal,Mohsenian S.; Kouhnavard B.; Nami M.; Mehdizadeh A.; Seif M.; Zamanian Z.,10.1080/10803548.2022.2131116
An Optimal Distributed RES Sizing Strategy in Hybrid Low Voltage Networks Focused on EVs' Integration,"The new era of the energy sector has already begun, and therefore, new challenges need to be tackled. A major challenge that residential distribution grids are going to encounter with the integration of photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric vehicles (EVs) is the unsynchronized new demand and the time-limited production of distributed generation, in combination with space limitations. Therefore, the necessity of energy storage systems (ESSs) is more than evident. ESSs have excessive manufacturing costs, implying that the purchase cost for residential users can be prohibitive. In the present work, a distributed optimal small-scale PV energy system sizing strategy is proposed, by considering the individual energy needs of each residence and their EVs. The strategy is formulated based on the demand of the households and EVs' charging. By enabling the fuzzy cognitive maps theory, a graph is designed, aiming to establish the correlation among the individual energy parameters and the characteristics of the renewable energy sources (RES). The optimization results reveal that the adopted hybrid approach can reduce the energy cost significantly, up to almost 40%, while enabling distribution system operators (DSOs) to incorporate additional loads, without the need for network expansion. Finally, based on the extracted results, a short discussion about the concept of EVs' charging by residential RES is presented.  © 2013 IEEE.",Distributed energy networks; EVs; fuzzy cognitive maps; hybrid energy systems; RES sizing,IEEE Access,2023,Journal,Boglou V.; Karavas C.-S.; Karlis A.; Arvanitis K.G.; Palaiologou I.,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3245152
Construction and Application of Workshop Twin Model based on Group Systems Cognition,"The digital twin workshop is considered a key technology for the transparency and continuous optimization of the workshop production process, as well as the trend of digital and intelligent development of the workshop. However, the current workshop digital twin model lacks a framework that can correlate the entire physical entity of the workshop and continuously compute and learn to empower the workshop with cognitive capabilities that can adapt to changing production conditions or new production scenarios. In this paper, a workshop digital twin model construction method based on group systems cognition (GS C) is proposed, aiming to realize the overall cognition of workshop production process in multiple layers from low-level physical subsystem to high-level group systems. Combining digital twin technology with the general cognitive principles of human problem solving in cognitive science, a workshop digital twin model framework including physical layer, virtual layer and cognitive layer is established; then, a multi-level cognitive computing model with sustainable learning capability was constructed by using information technology, so that the workshop twin model has cognitive capability. Finally, the application validation of the GSC-based workshop twin was carried out in an aerospace structural component manufacturing workshop as an example, and it was verified that GSC can endow the workshop twin with certain cognitive ability and effectively improve the workshop productivity.  © 2023 IEEE.",cognition; group systems; Workshop twin model,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops, VRW 2023",2023,Conference,Li E.; Zhou J.; Wang M.; Zhang S.; Jiang T.,10.1109/VRW58643.2023.00098
Extended Control With Hybrid Gaze-BCI for Multi-Robot System Under Hands-Occupied Dual-Tasking,"Currently there still remains a critical need of human involvements for multi-robot system (MRS) to successfully perform their missions in real-world applications, and the hand-controller has been commonly used for the operator to input MRS control commands. However, in more challenging scenarios involving concurrent MRS control and system monitoring tasks, where the operator's both hands are busy, the hand-controller alone is inadequate for effective human-MRS interaction. To this end, our study takes a first step toward a multimodal interface by extending the hand-controller with a hands-free input based on gaze and brain-computer interface (BCI), i.e., a hybrid gaze-BCI. Specifically, the velocity control function is still designated to the hand-controller that excels at inputting continuous velocity commands for MRS, while the formation control function is realized with a more intuitive hybrid gaze-BCI, rather than with the hand-controller via a less natural mapping. In a dual-task experimental paradigm that simulated the hands-occupied manipulation condition in real-world applications, operators achieved improved performance for controlling simulated MRS (average formation inputting accuracy increases 3%, average finishing time decreases 5 s), reduced cognitive load (average reaction time for secondary task decreases 0.32 s) and perceived workload (average rating score decreases 15.84) with the hand-controller extended by the hybrid gaze-BCI, over those with the hand-controller alone. These findings reveal the potential of the hands-free hybrid gaze-BCI to extend the traditional manual MRS input devices for creating a more operator-friendly interface, in challenging hands-occupied dual-tasking scenarios.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.",brain-computer interface; dual-tasking; electroencephalograph; Gaze tracking; multi-robot system,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,2023,Journal,Zeng H.; Shen Y.; Sun D.; Hu X.; Wen P.; Song A.,10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3234971
"A Comprehensive Review of Haptic Gloves: Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions","The sense of touch and feel is an important asset to the human beings in all aspects across a variety of fields. For a long time, it has been almost impossible to mimic the sense of touch i.e. the natural feedback. Devices that had been developed have been based around piezo electric, Hall Effect sensors, and a combination of sensors and actuators to sense and replicate the feedback. To a certain extent, they have laid the foundation for the field of haptics. Haptics initially were limited to the vibrotactile responses, which were the ones commonly seen in the modern smartphone. Further research and development has led to it being closer than ever to mimic the sense of touch. Several devices were created by incorporating the field of haptics with existing design and devices. One such device is the Haptic glove. A haptic glove is a cutting-edge technology that allows human operators to physically feel the sensation of touch and force feedback when remotely controlling robots or other devices. These gloves are designed to mimic the sense of touch, allowing the operator to feel the shape, texture, and rigidity of the object they are manipulating through the robot. The use of haptic gloves in robotic teleoperation has been found to improve the precision and accuracy of remote tasks, as well as reducing the cognitive load on the operator. This technology can be adopted in field such as manufacturing, surgery, and space exploration. For example, in manufacturing, haptic gloves can be used to remotely operate machinery or perform inspections on hard-to-reach areas, while in surgery; haptic gloves can enable surgeons to perform remote surgeries with greater precision and control. In space exploration, haptic gloves can be used to remotely control robots for tasks such as sample collection and maintenance. Future developments in haptic technology could lead to even more advanced and realistic haptic feedback, further enhancing the capabilities of robotic teleoperation.  © 2023 IEEE.",Force feedback; Haptics and Haptic Interfaces; Tactile feedback; Teleoperation; Vibro-tactile feedback,"Proceedings of the 2023 2nd International Conference on Electronics and Renewable Systems, ICEARS 2023",2023,Conference,Shanmugam M.; Venusamy K.; Subin S.; Srivatsan S.; Kumar O.N.,10.1109/ICEARS56392.2023.10085607
IMPROVEMENT OF COMPETENCE OF LABOUR PROTECTION SPECIALISTS ASSESSMENT OF COGNITIVE ERGONOMIC ASPECTS IN JSC LATVIAN STATE FORESTS (LVM) NURSERIES,"Influenced by the current COVID-19 situation in Latvia and in the world, work environment is associated with psychological load – the psycho-emotional risk factor as an aspect of cognitive ergonomics, which can affect employees’ health, productivity and quality. Forest nursery work is usually solitary, and it is conducted out-of-doors. In Latvia, the agricultural industry employs about 50 thousand workers in various trades performing diverse tasks, for example, working at forestry tasks with tractor equipment and in outdoor conditions with hand-held power tools, as well as office work and working with timber transport. For this reason, the present research is relevant, as it aims to identify the psycho-emotional risk factors in cognitive ergonomic effects on the health of workers in forest management, and to make proposals to reduce the risks. The following methods were use in the research: work environment risk assessment, burnout syndrome test, and the method for determining the working capacity index, Charles D. Spielberger’s survey, and a well-being survey. The highest risk factors for forestry workers in their daily employment are working in a forced position and in different weather conditions, which can affect employees psychologically. The largest number of employees with signs of fatigue is found in the age groups of 40-49 and 50-59 years. The study identified the need to increase the competence of labour protection specialists by improving the master program to ensure the necessary raising of awareness in the context of cognitive ergonomics. © 2023 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

Evolving Maintenance Practices into Guided Decision Assistance Tools,"This paper aims to discuss how the evolution of maintenance in a digital age has been influenced by technology to allow for the previously established procedural norm can be re-evaluated and modified for improvement when it comes to the tools and capabilities that can be provided to users performing maintenance. As an example, the established procedural norm may instruct maintainers to simply remove and replace part 'x' in order to complete the maintenance action. We will seek to show how this task is not as simple as it may seem to be, and how data is allowing for additional decisions to be made, the creation of tools that support the user with aid in these decisions, and how the evolution of maintenance is going to change because of it.We also hope to show how Guided Decision Assist tools increase effectiveness at the point of need, both in the field and on the manufacturing floor, by providing aid in cognitive and situational clarification to decisions that would otherwise be reliant on human intuition. Through this examination, the paper will discuss tools that would present the user with opportunities to address topics such as, but not limited to scheduling (equipment/personnel), Asset commitment conflicts, environmental conditions that may help or hinder the repair/maintenance process, replacement part availability, and similar failures that could be addressed more efficiently if done in conjunction with other actions. These additional inputs are valuable to the user as it can mitigate the need/reliance a given individual, as well as allows the user make more efficient and effective fix/fight decisions for the equipment and its performance requirements. © 2023 IEEE.",AI/ML; Availability; Maintenance; Troubleshooting,Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium,2023,Conference,Hoffman D.; Fecteau S.,10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088262
Velocity range-based reward shaping technique for effective map-less navigation with LiDAR sensor and deep reinforcement learning,"In recent years, sensor components similar to human sensory functions have been rapidly developed in the hardware field, enabling the acquisition of information at a level beyond that of humans, and in the software field, artificial intelligence technology has been utilized to enable cognitive abilities and decision-making such as prediction, analysis, and judgment. These changes are being utilized in various industries and fields. In particular, new hardware and software technologies are being rapidly applied to robotics products, showing a level of performance and completeness that was previously unimaginable. In this paper, we researched the topic of establishing an optimal path plan for autonomous driving using LiDAR sensors and deep reinforcement learning in a workplace without map and grid coordinates for mobile robots, which are widely used in logistics and manufacturing sites. For this purpose, we reviewed the hardware configuration of mobile robots capable of autonomous driving, checked the characteristics of the main core sensors, and investigated the core technologies of autonomous driving. In addition, we reviewed the appropriate deep reinforcement learning algorithm to realize the autonomous driving of mobile robots, defined a deep neural network for autonomous driving data conversion, and defined a reward function for path planning. The contents investigated in this paper were built into a simulation environment to verify the autonomous path planning through experiment, and an additional reward technique “Velocity Range-based Evaluation Method” was proposed for further improvement of performance indicators required in the real field, and the effectiveness was verified. The simulation environment and detailed results of experiments are described in this paper, and it is expected as guidance and reference research for applying these technologies in the field.

Towards the modelling of defect generation in human-robot collaborative assembly,"The development of suitable defect generation models is crucial in both academia and industry having the dual purpose of predicting defects occurring in manufacturing processes and planning eligible effective quality controls. In manual assembly processes, much research focused on developing approaches to predict operator-generated defects. Today, collaborative robotics is gaining increasing attention in smart factories by contributing to the reduction of operators' physical and cognitive workload and thus enabling improved productivity.

A Conceptual Model Framework for XAI Requirement Elicitation of Application Domain System,"The use of data analytics and Machine Learning (ML) branches of AI for predictive and analytic knowledge retrieval has surged significantly in various industries (e.g., health, finance, business, and manufacturing). However, the acceptance of AI has been hindered by opaque models that lack transparency. Explainability in AI (XAI) has gained significant prominence owing to its focus on introducing avenues of accountability in AI. XAI acknowledges the importance of human factors and strives to incorporate them into the design process, recognising that the cognitive effort involved in understanding explanations is a key aspect. Mental Models play a crucial role in the XAI evaluative premise, but their current utility is limited. By intentionally designing explanations that align with users' mental models, their experiences can be significantly enhanced, leading to improved understanding, satisfaction, trust, and performance. This study proposes using Mental Models to elicit explainability requirements and to develop an Ontology-Driven Conceptual Model to facilitate the learning process for a better understanding of explanations. © 2023 The Authors.

Building the Assurance Case for Recovery of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles from Offshore Platforms,"Digitalization was identified by the International Regulators’ Forum (IRF) as one of three key problems in 2021 due to the petroleum industry becoming increasingly reliant on automated systems. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are of particular interest for inspection and maintenance of offshore platform infrastructure; however, the integration of such a complex system requires careful mitigation of safety health and environment risks associated with its operation. Analysis of human factors, including ergonomics, job organization, and cognitive considerations, has been recommended by the IRF to increase confidence that the interaction of the operators and the equipment (manually controlled, automated, or autonomous) permits safe delivery of the system capability in a safe working environment. The established CRitical Intervention and OPerability (CRIOP) analysis methodology is chosen as the basis for constructing an assurance case for an AUV control station on an offshore platform. CRIOP's goal is to show that the control center is able to safely manage all modes of operation. This paper proposes a CRIOP Assurance Case Template for a control station on an offshore platform. The proposed template uses goal structuring notation (GSN) with arguments, assumptions, and solutions, following the strategy of the CRIOP methodology. This template supports a critique of CRIOP's completeness arguments, goal-based structure, and solution acceptance criteria. Next, an assurance case for an AUV recovery operation is instantiated from the template for three cases with different autonomy levels: manual, automated with a human-in-the-loop, and autonomous. The increasing level of autonomy was shown to result in both technical and methodological variances to the assurance case including: layout changes as the control station moves from the open deck of a boat to a control room; changes in the acceptance criteria for the expertise of analysis team members; and the recommendation for additional scenarios that address situations in which the level of autonomy must be decreased due to safety concerns. Interviews with experienced AUV operators and developers revealed the value in including operators in the CRIOP analysis team to increase operator confidence in being able to maintain meaningful human control in all modes of operation. It is only with this confidence that autonomous systems will be used for the ambitious missions they can perform. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.",,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2023,Conference,Deeb A.; Garner T.; Kuchekar D.,10.4043/32185-MS

OPERATOR 4.0 FOR HYBRID MANUFACTURING,"Hybrid manufacturing, a combination of additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities in one system, has recently become a more viable production option across several industries. Although current hybrid manufacturing research covers a broad range of topics, there is a lack of focus on how this new technology impacts both the designer and the operator of hybrid systems. This paper identifies areas of literature across design theory and Industry/Operator 4.0 research efforts and presents a path for applying this research to hybrid manufacturing users. The unique relationship between operator and designer is highlighted as they learn new strategies and develop new intuitive judgements over time to become the first experienced/expert users of hybrid manufacturing. The potential impact of excessive cognitive workload due to the novel combination of processes is discussed. This paper begins a critical discussion about proper knowledge transfer to other hybrid designers and operators, as well as towards efforts of monitoring, inspecting, and automating hybrid manufacturing processes. © The Author(s), 2023.

Validating an abnormal situation prediction model for smart manufacturing in the oil refining industry,"Human beings play an important role in a smart manufacturing economy. The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Control room; Eye-tracking; Interactive devices; Statistical modeling prediction,Applied Ergonomics,2022,Journal,Shi C.; Rothrock L.,10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103697
Transparency Analysis of a Passive Heavy Load Comanipulation Arm,"For collaborative robotics applications, many systems have addressed general handling issues in recent years. Depending on the industrial context, these systems bring physical and cognitive feelings that result in the acceptance of their users. Transparency qualifies the ability of a robot to follow the movements imposed by the operator without noting any resistant effort. The objective of this article is to develop a methodology that mixes the approach highlighting the human factors and their correlation to robotic criteria in the case of a passive manipulation arm with six degrees of freedom produced by the Neoditech company. An exploratory study was then conducted to measure criteria such as time, speed, and effort during manipulation along with criteria based on a technological level, personality and technology acceptance model-method questionnaires. From there, we uncovered a correlation between the user's personality, particularly their lack of neuroticism, and their means of evaluating the device through its usefulness, comfort, and indicators of mechanical behavior. This study is a preliminary analysis of user behaviors and traits that affect technological acceptance when dealing with a comanipulation arm. This work offers a framework for similar future analyses and recommends mechanical adjustments to the arm for increased user acceptance.  © 2013 IEEE.","Collaborative arm; collaborative robotics; comanipulation; force sensing; humanâÂ€Â""robot interaction; manipulation system; transparency",IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,2022,Journal,Muller T.; Subrin K.; Joncheray D.; Billon A.; Garnier S.,10.1109/THMS.2022.3156887
Exploring Conflicting Dynamics in Product and Production Development Within Industrialized House Building,"The product realisation process is one of several formalized supports for industrial actors to excel in concurrent engineering procedures. To satisfy customers today mass customization is increasingly in need, requiring delicate modular architectures, both in product designs and production. Emerging is also the digitalized co-platforming era of automating the synchronization of product and production platforms. Yet, in all these processes, humans as agents have different roles, objectives, and mental models that governs their decision-making, being the bearer of separate ideas on what to optimize from their end. In product development large sensitivity is given to customer demands and trends to design attractive products, while less attention may be placed on evaluating the increase of variation into the production flows from new products, potentially increasing the workload and complexity of assembly systems, as well as, the subsequent material logistics. In production, much effort is invested to increase standardization, increase the pace, and minimize the manufacturing cost, with the objective to minimize required changes to the current production system. Consequently, it is a hard problem to satisfy all criteria at once, and how to solve it has no clear answer. Therefore, this study has applied qualitative System Dynamics modelling, also often referred to as systems thinking, to investigate how these opposing views were represented at an industrialized house builder. The purpose was to explore and model the perspectives and mental models of two leading roles to model their conflicting objectives. As a result, an overall model of main interactions of product and production development is proposed to support interpreting the findings, visualize the identified conflicting dynamics, and work as a vehicle for analysis. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.",Integration; Platforms; Product realisation; Production development; Systems thinking,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2022,Conference,Linnéusson G.; Boldt S.; Rösiö C.,10.3233/ATDE220199
Understanding the Ethical Concerns for Neurotechnology in the Future of Work,"Advances in automation and autonomous systems means that the future of work will involve even more cognitive effort. For those in already cognitively demanding work, many of us aim to optimise our effort and productivity to achieve more in work, and ideally to rest outside of work. Neuroergonomics research is concerned with how neurotechnology will help improve work to be manageable and safe, often in e.g. safety critical work, operators experience high demands and mental workload. Meanwhile, Neuroethics is concerned with the largely unregulated future of this industry, involving technologies that are not technically medical devices, but will involve invasive forms of personal data. This work aims to explicate the privacy, trust, and ethical concerns that workers have about employers using neurotechnology to manage their work-forces. An online survey and themes drawn from interviews with factory and office workers are presented. We conclude by discussing these concerns and how they might affect the rapidly expanding neurotechnology industry.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",employees; employers; ethics; future of work; neuroethics; neurotechnology; privacy; trust,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022,Conference,Martinez W.; Benerradi J.; Midha S.; Maior H.A.; Wilson M.L.,10.1145/3533406.3533423
Engineer-Centred Design Factors and Methodological Approach for Maritime Autonomy Emergency Response Systems,"Commercial deployment of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) is close to becoming a reality. Although MASSs are fully autonomous, the industry will still allow remote operations centre (ROC) operators to intervene if a MASS is facing an emergency the MASS cannot handle by itself. A human-centred design for the associated emergency response systems will require attention to the ROC operator workplace, but also, arguably, to the behaviour-shaping constraints on the engineers building these systems. There is thus a need for an engineer-centred design of engineering organisations, influenced by the current discourse on human factors. To contribute to the discourse, think-aloud protocol interviewing was conducted with well-informed maritime operators to elicit fundamental demands on cognition and collaboration by maritime autonomy emergency response systems. Based on the results, inferences were made regarding both design factors and methodological choices for future, early phase engineering of emergency response systems. Firstly, engineering firms have to improve their informal gathering and sharing of information through gatekeepers and/or organisational liaisons. To avoid a too cautious approach to accountability, this will have to include a closer integration of development and operations. Secondly, associated studies taking the typical approach of exposing relevant operators to new design concepts in scripted scenarios should include significant flexibility and less focus on realism. © 2022 by the authors.",cognitive systems engineering; emergency response; engineer-centred design; human-centred design; maritime autonomous surface ship (MASS); maritime autonomy; remote operations centre (ROC); safety,Safety,2022,Journal,Asplund F.; Ulfvengren P.,10.3390/safety8030054
Cognitive engine for augmented human decision-making in manufacturing process control,"A pre-planned production workflow may need to adapt to instantaneous states of resources, materials, and workpieces. This adaptation poses an additional challenge when multiple custom workpieces are enmeshed in complex processes. This paper presents a novel framework, Cognitive Engine Process Controller (CEPC), which realizes a human-centric manufacturing system by augmenting the human in workflow selection and providing the flexibility in using alternative methods in the workflow. The CEPC streamlines overwhelming information for the human to select the next manufacturing steps via dynamic web ontology language (OWL) ontologies, a conflict checker, and a learner.

"Augmented Workforce: contextual, cross-hierarchical enquiries on human-technology integration in industry","Although shop floors become more automated, manual labor is more than the sum of recurring tasks which can simply be executed by autonomous machines. Where total automation is ineffective, operator assistance systems (OAS) could increase productivity and empower the workforce. Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) are systems that interact with operators to modify their cognitive or physical capabilities whilst performing industrial tasks. Given the important role of humans in future manufacturing environments that cannot be automated, production organizations in industry and Human-Technology Integration (HTI) researchers need to understand where OAS can be deployed and what human factors and other human implications arise from their deployment. In short, capturing views from stakeholders who are both affected by and affect the successful implementation of new technologies are essential to align technological innovations with a human-centric perspective. However, based on our literature review of OAS, we find that there are few technology-neutral enquiries on the industrial applicability of OAS. In particular, we note a lack of considerations of the different requirements for OAS resulting from diverse stakeholders in industry, which is expected to be of importance when designing effective HTI. To address this gap, we explore the industrial context of OAS and the perspectives of stakeholder groups across organizations on the applicability of OAS using a multi-method research approach encompassing 27 qualitative expert interviews and ethnographic observations of three industrial contexts. A key finding of our contextual enquiry is that participants expect OAS to be beneficial on shop floors if designed to improve cognitive abilities, such as inductive reasoning. Further, in the case a company seeks to introduce an OAS to augment physical capabilities of operators whilst attached to their bodies, the data indicate a cautious approach is sensible as many operators reject such a form of augmentation. We highlight what our findings mean for HTI research, especially as it relates to consideration of the highly contextual user requirements when developing and integrating human-technology systems for industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Augmented Industries; Cyber-physical production system; Future of work; Human-centered; Industry 4.0; Operator assistance system; Worker support,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,Moencks M.; Roth E.; Bohné T.; Kristensson P.O.,10.1016/j.cie.2021.107822
Development and evaluation of design guidelines for cognitive ergonomics in human-robot collaborative assembly systems,"Industry 4.0 is the concept used to summarize the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which is profoundly changing the manufacturing systems and business models all over the world. Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Cognitive ergonomics; Collaborative assembly systems; Collaborative robotics; Human factors; Industry 4.0,Applied Ergonomics,2022,Journal,Gualtieri L.; Fraboni F.; De Marchi M.; Rauch E.,10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103807
Research on the relations between cognition and intelligent transformation of executive teams in small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises,"Intelligent manufacturing is crucial to realize high-quality development and competitiveness improvement of the manufacturing industry. This study takes team cognition as the research perspective, seeks the antecedent variables and theoretical application scenarios of the intelligent transformation of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, follows the theoretical paradigm of “cognition-behavior-effect” and contingency analysis logic of environmental factors to construct a relationship model that includes the cognitive complexity, cognitive flexibility, bricolage behavior and intelligent transformation of the executive team. An empirical research on the relationship of core variables are conducted based on the survey data from 195 small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. The results show that: bricolage behavior plays a partial mediating role between cognitive complexity and intelligent transformation and a complete mediating role between cognitive flexibility and intelligent transformation; cognitive complexity and cognitive flexibility positively regulate each other's relationship between the bricolage behavior and intelligent transformation. The research reveals an important question of “how small and medium-sized manufacturing executives’ team cognition induces bricolage behavior and promotes intelligent transformation”, with a view to further improving team cognition theory and bricolage theory, thus providing valuable suggestions on breaking resource constraints and pursuing transformation and upgrading for small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. © 2022",Business information systems; Cognitive flexibility; Continuous improvement team; Manufacturing management,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2022,Journal,Zhou J.; Lan S.; Liu Y.; Rong T.; Huisingh D.,10.1016/j.aei.2022.101539
Research on visual optimization design of machine-machine interface for mechanical industrial equipment based on nonlinear partial equations,"With the continuous development and progress of machinery and industry equipment, human-machine interface has become an important operation in industry equipment and has been widely used in aviation, monitoring, traffic, special engineering vehicles, and a series of complex fields. Through the human-machine interface information system, information and data are provided for operators s. As the human-machine interface information data of the mechanical equipment system are numerous, complex, and changeable, operators often make operation mistakes, misread and misjudge, and do not give timely feedback, resulting in task failure or, in serious cases, major mechanical faults and accidents. Therefore, the human-machine interface data information is screened, and the information useful for the operator is directly obtained according to the target set by the operator, so as to effectively solve the complex and changeable data information in the information system. Human-machine interface uses electronic communication technology, computer network technology, and database technology to expand and update machinery and industrial equipment. Among them, nonlinear partial differential equations comprise an important branch of equation in mathematics. In this paper, according to the nonlinear partial differential equations, we research and analyze the information system of the human-machine interface design field and solve the system of the cognitive load, which is too large, such as cognitive mismatch problem in the working mode of operating personnel, by satisfying the needs of different users.

Cognitive biases' influence on employees' product creativity and product performance: evidences from Italian manufacturing technology firms,"Purpose: This paper aims to empirically investigate how cognitive biases influence employees' product creativity (EPC) and related product performance. In particular, the paper primarily studies (1) the direct effect of employees' implicit creativity – based on five cognitive biases – and explicit creativity on EPC; and (2) the mediating role of coworkers' heuristic transfer between shared leadership and EPC. Design/methodology/approach: Data have been obtained from big Italian manufacturing technology firms through a series of online questionnaires that resulted in 555 answers from R&D employees and their direct managers, who are, respectively, involved and responsible for the proposal of manufacturing technology products. The developed four theoretical hypotheses have been tested through correlation analysis, hierarchical regression, mediation analysis and structured equation modelling. Findings: Cognitive biases positively influence EPC in manufacturing technology firms, leading to positive product performance. In particular, implicit creative personality better predicts EPC than explicit creative personality; whilst, shared leadership leads to a cognitive convergence among co-workers through the spread of heuristics that positively influence EPC. Originality/value: The originality of this work lies in having: (1) investigated the influence of cognitive biases in creativity, (2) hypothesized and proved that co-workers' heuristic transfer mediates the relationship between shared leadership and EPC; (3) conducted the first specific study on employees' creativity in manufacturing technology firms; and (4) first implemented the implicit creative personality measurement, apart from those who conceptualized it. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cognitive biases; Creativity; Heuristic; Manufacturing; Performance; Structured equation modelling,Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management,2022,Journal,Cristofaro M.; Leoni L.; Giardino P.L.,10.1108/JMTM-10-2020-0414
Mixed reality-integrated 3D/2D vision mapping for intuitive teleoperation of mobile manipulator,"Depth cues are crucial to increase user perception and spatial awareness of the remote environment when remotely guiding complex robotic systems. A mixed reality (MR) integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping framework for immersive and intuitive telemanipulation of a complex mobile manipulator is presented. The proposed 3D immersive telerobotic schemes provide the users with depth perception through the merging of multiple 3D/2D views of the remote environment via MR subspace. The mobile manipulator platform consists of a 6°-of-freedom (DOF) industrial manipulator, 3D-printed parallel gripper, and mobile base, which can be controlled by non-skilled operators who are physically separated from the robot working space through a velocity-based imitative motion mapping approach. This work evaluates the impact of depth perception and immersion provided by integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes on teleoperation efficiency and user experience in an MR environment. In particular, the MR enhanced systems maintain spatial awareness and perceptual salience of the remote scene in 3D, facilitating intuitive mixed reality human-robot interaction (MR-HRI). This study compared two MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes against a typical 2D Baseline visual display method through pick-and-place, assembly, and dexterous manufacturing tasks. The MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes of teleoperation reduced overall task completion times by 34% and 17%, compared to the MR-2D Baseline, while minimizing training effort and cognitive workload. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Mixed reality; Robotic manipulation; Teleoperation; Vision and motion mapping,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2022,Journal,Su Y.; Chen X.; Zhou T.; Pretty C.; Chase G.,10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102332
Human Factor Index Measurement Using an ISM-SEM-Fuzzy Approach,"In recent years, there has been a trend toward automation and data exchange in manufacturing processes through industrial cognitive computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence. However, the human–machine interface plays a role in establishing a smart manufacturing system in any industry. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive model to identify the risk factors that contribute to the loss of human performance and productivity and evaluate the workplace for its compliance and agility toward safe human–machine systems. In this study, a model is proposed that can be used as a measurement tool to design ergonomic workplaces in the automotive industry. Several criteria have been classified under four enablers: physiological factors, psychological factors, environmental factors, and safety factors. These were identified through a literature review. The proposed model integrates the applications of structural equation modeling (SEM), interpretive structural modeling (ISM), and the multigrade fuzzy approach. ISM was employed to demonstrate the applicability of the model to depict various ergonomic enablers considered in the ergonomic measurement. SEM was used to validate the ergonomic measurement model statistically. Physiological factors were found to be highly correlated with ergonomic practices. Physiological and psychological factors were also highly correlated. The use of the multigrade fuzzy approach was demonstrated to determine the human factor index for an automotive component manufacturing industry. The proposed model can enable management to evaluate the various risk factors that hamper the ergonomic level of a company and thereby allow the company to harness the benefits of ergonomics to enhance safety and productivity. © 2022 by the authors.

Systematic selection methodology for worker assistance systems in manufacturing,"The transformation process of the industry into a more digitized world is a key challenge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. On the one hand, the advantages of new technologies must be used profitably, on the other hand, the workforce needs to be prepared to deal with new technologies and the complexity and speed that the today's production entails. Worker assistance systems offer the possibility to simplify the interaction between humans and complex machines and to reinforce physical and cognitive skills of employees. Although, worker assistance systems are available on the market, methods, focusing on the systematic selection of appropriate worker assistance systems for specific work tasks and worker types are missing. This paper presents a novel and systematic selection methodology, to analyze and evaluate the workplace, the employee, and the respective work task, based on previously defined parameters. An innovative selection algorithm enables a ranking of potential useful worker assistance systems. Therefore, the proposed novel selection methodology not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge, but also proves to be a helpful tool for practitioners in selecting the right assistance system for both, human workers, and manufacturing operations. © 2022",Assistance systems; Industry 4.0; Methodology; Operator 4.0; Smart manufacturing; Systematic selection,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,Mark B.G.; Rauch E.; Matt D.T.,10.1016/j.cie.2022.107982
Study on semantic-entity relevance of industrial icons and generation of metaphor design,"The intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry is accompanied by the visualization of industrial information, and the semantic expression of industrial icons plays a crucial role in improving operators' cognitive performance. Taking the production process of a battery production line as the research object, we studied the semantics-entity relevance of industrial icons based on the concepts of “signifier” and “signified” in metaphorical cognition as well as “topic” and “vehicle.” On this basis, we designed the icons of eight process stations (precleaning, diffusion, coating, screen printing, power testing, etc.) of the battery production line using the metaphor design method. The experimental results show that the icons complying with the law of semantic cognition have high search efficiency. It is concluded that the industrial icons should be designed according to the relevance between functional semantics and entity specific to each production process and that applying such carefully designed industrial icons to industrial information visualization will effectively improve the cognitive performance of operators. © 2021 Society for Information Display.",cognitive performance; industrial icon; metaphorical design; semantic cognition,Journal of the Society for Information Display,2022,Journal,Wu X.; Yan H.; Jiaran N.; Gu Z.,10.1002/jsid.1088
Edge computing-driven scene-aware intelligent augmented reality assembly,"Wearable augmented reality (AR) refers to the technology that the virtual models and annotations generated by computers can be superimposed on the real scene, and which can be utilized to help workers perform intuitive manual assembly operations. Nevertheless, most of the existing AR-aided assembly processes are carried out by triggering the step-by-step visual instruction manually, lacking scene-aware generation for the assembly assistance accordingly. To facilitate an intelligent AR-aided assembly, this paper proposed an edge computing (EC)-driven Scene-aware Intelligent AR Assembly (EC-SIARA) system, which can understand the assembly status on the fly with the lightweight wearable AR glass, and thus, worker-centered assistance is available to provide intuitive visual guidance accordingly. In beginning, the connection between the wearable AR glasses and EC system is established, which can alleviate the computing burden for the resource-constraint wearable AR glasses, and a high-efficiency scene awareness module during the manual assembly process is achieved. And then, based on context understanding of the current assembly status, the intuitive instructions can be triggered automatically, avoiding the operator’s cognitive load to launch the next AR instruction strictly. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed EC-SIARA system, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can realize a worker-center AR assembly process, improve the assembly efficiency, and reduce the occurrence of assembly errors effectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Edge computing; Intelligent augmented reality; Intelligent manufacturing; Manual assembly; Scene-aware,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2022,Journal,Fu M.; Fang W.; Gao S.; Hong J.; Chen Y.,10.1007/s00170-022-08758-4
"Danger, high voltage! Using EEG and EOG measurements for cognitive overload detection in a simulated industrial context","Industrial settings will be characterized by far-reaching production automation brought about by advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, human assembly workers will need to adapt quickly to new and more complex assembly procedures, which are most likely to increase cognitive workload, or potentially induce overload. Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workers’ cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Assembly task; Cognitive ergonomics; Cognitive workload; EEG; EOG; Industrial setting; Overload,Applied Ergonomics,2022,Journal,Morton J.; Zheleva A.; Van Acker B.B.; Durnez W.; Vanneste P.; Larmuseau C.; De Bruyne J.; Raes A.; Cornillie F.; Saldien J.; De Marez L.; Bombeke K.,10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103763
Virtual Reality for Safe Testing and Development in Collaborative Robotics: Challenges and Perspectives,"Collaborative robots (cobots) could help humans in tasks that are mundane, dangerous or where direct human contact carries risk. Yet, the collaboration between humans and robots is severely limited by the aspects of the safety and comfort of human operators. In this paper, we outline the use of extended reality (XR) as a way to test and develop collaboration with robots. We focus on virtual reality (VR) in simulating collaboration scenarios and the use of cobot digital twins. This is specifically useful in situations that are difficult or even impossible to safely test in real life, such as dangerous scenarios. We describe using XR simulations as a means to evaluate collaboration with robots without putting humans at harm. We show how an XR setting enables combining human behavioral data, subjective self-reports, and biosignals signifying human comfort, stress and cognitive load during collaboration. Several works demonstrate XR can be used to train human operators and provide them with augmented reality (AR) interfaces to enhance their performance with robots. We also provide a first attempt at what could become the basis for a human–robot collaboration testing framework, specifically for designing and testing factors affecting human– robot collaboration. The use of XR has the potential to change the way we design and test cobots, and train cobot operators, in a range of applications: from industry, through healthcare, to space operations. © 2022 by the authors.

Smart Manufacturing with Augmented Reality,"Aircraft Manufacturing procedures are very critical which always require skillful engineers who must adhere to various process and procedure during daily work. The challenge is not only to identify right tools and manuals but also to keep track of operator usage data and behavior. With Augmented reality (AR), intelligent tools and analytics, we can provide a new lease of life to first-line assembly engineers. The objective is how AR can help us to reduce rework or scrap with the concept of Industry 4.0 [1] were integrating with cutting edge technologies like machine learning and the internet of things (IoT) to meet the fundamental requirements during manufacturing. Smart Manufacturing consists of four major components Cyber-physical systems, IoT, cloud computing and cognitive computing. Our objective is to integrate Augmented reality with IoT sensor to achieve Cyber-physical systems connectivity and fill the gap between the smallest physical assets connected with digital infrastructure. It can help us to increase manufacturing throughput, make tools intelligent, accelerate training, inventory management and most important operator safety. Our AR applications are developed on PTC [9] software platform which can be tablet-based, or headset based, and content can be accessible globally within organisation. Overall, it is not about a technology that lies in the visualization process only, it is about how data are visualized, captured and utilized to make the working environment safe and productive, which makes this technology powerful in manufacturing ecosystem.  © 2022 SAE International.

Integrating human cognition in cyber-physical systems: A multidimensional fuzzy pattern model with application to thermal spraying,"The development of next-generation, intelligent manufacturing relies on the realization of human-cyber-physical systems. This key area of transdisciplinary research seeks to interrogate ways of supporting and integrating human cognition and expertise in complex cyber-physical systems, using modelling methods from artificial intelligence. This paper uses the exemplar of wear classification in thermal spraying to outline how relevant cognitive processes can be elicited and combined with technical variables in a singular, efficient and cognitively plausible modelling framework. To this end, eye tracking and high-resolution voltage measurements were performed in a pilot study, and a representative data set was generated for small data problems. Two multidimensional fuzzy pattern classification models were derived. Results show that both human and technical models are significant and complement one another. While the models still require optimizing, they clearly show that the integrative approach is practicable and fruitful. Our findings call for further transdisciplinary research of the development of cognitive assistance as well as predictive maintenance and quality assurance. © 2022 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy pattern classification; Human-cyber-physical systems; Human-machine teaming; Thermal spraying,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,Bocklisch F.; Paczkowski G.; Zimmermann S.; Lampke T.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.03.005
Human–cobot interaction fluency and cobot operators’ job performance. The mediating role of work engagement: A survey,"Advanced human–robot interaction becomes an essential resource in Industry 4.0. Specifically, the deployment of collaborative robots (cobots) has changed the game in modern smart factories. These robotic agents assist human operators, working with them side-by-side on joint task execution. Because cobots are designed to be more co-workers than tools, fluent interaction between the operators and their robotic counterparts is critical for employees’ task accomplishment and, thus, high performance. The current study investigates the relationships between four perspectives of human–robot interaction fluency (i.e., the human emotions-oriented, the human contribution-oriented, the robot-oriented, and the team-oriented fluency) and operators’ subjective job performance. It also examines the mediating role of work engagement in these relationships. The analysis carried out on 190 male and female cobot operators working on the shop floor showed positive associations between human–robot interaction (HRI) fluency and job performance. The study confirmed the mediating role of work engagement in the relationships of human contribution-oriented fluency and team-oriented fluency with job performance. The obtained results suggest that HRI fluency relates to employee job performance because of the positive affective–cognitive state experienced by the operator when cooperating with a cobot in a coordinated and well-synchronized manner. The findings of the study are discussed within the theoretical framework of cognitive ergonomics, the Job Demand-Control-Support model, the job demands-resources model, and the job design perspective.

Exploration of digitalized presentation of information for Operator 4.0: Five industrial cases,"In the digital transformation of manufacturing companies towards Industry 4.0, shop-floor operators of the future, Operator 4.0, will require digitalized presentation of information as cognitive support for their work. This paper explores five industrial cases where Information Support Technology have been conceptualized and developed. These cases have exemplified how digitalized presentation of information can be approached with considerations of operators with varying cognitive work situations and production characteristics. Furthermore, these new technical capabilities have increased the level of cognitive automation to support operators’ individual abilities to perform their work in an increasingly more complex production environment.

Automated well control: A step change in safety,"In the oil and gas industry, the operation of drilling is a process which has been manually controlled. Well control is a safety critical function, and it is used to enable safe management of pressures and fluids encountered whilst drilling. Losing well control resulting in an uncontrolled flow of reservoir fluids to surface and subsequent blowout, or fuel fed fire, can occur. The process of controlling this major accident hazard has also been manually controlled and is therefore subject to significant human factors' issues. Each year multiple blowouts and several fatality events happen due to a loss of well control. Traditionally, well control has been completely reliant on a human to identify and react to an influx. However, the human condition means the driller can be distracted, or suddenly influenced by extraneous factors. Overreliance on humans in well control poses a danger to the safety in well operations, because of the inherent and constant exposure to human factors risk. Tasks that require sustained periods of cognitive awareness and reaction can be best performed by an automated process. Other industries have successfully implemented automation to reduce the risks and produce more consistent and efficient outcomes; however, automation of well control has not yet been fully applied. The oil and gas industry can improve from a personnel safety, environmental and reputational perspective. As in other industries, automating the function of well control represents a significant improvement in process safety for drilling operations. With the rapid advancement of technologies associated with simulators and cyber-rigs over the past 20 years, several new technologies have emerged. One of them is a technology which enables automated well control whilst in drilling mode. The Automated Well Control system has been designed to fully automate influx detection and shut-in sequences. Once the system detects the influx, it performs a series of automated operations by taking control of the drilling rig equipment. The drill string is spaced out, top drive and mud pumps are stopped, and the BOP is closed. The system is currently designed for the drilling phase, which also covers initial tripping off bottom and back-reaming, and has been substantially tested against drilling simulators with real drillers. Additionally, a full field trials has been conducted using a conventional land rig which demonstrated the effectiveness of the standard system, proving up the functionality under different operational requirements. A technology qualification exercise was conducted, and the system has received a Technology Qualification Certificate for cyber and traditional rigs. To date, there are around 100 potential modules that can be developed using the same technology to cover every aspect of well construction and decommissioning operations. Existing systems in use on rigs, such as Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and Early Kick Detection Systems (EKDS), can also benefit from linking directly with the Automated Well Control system to facilitate a fast and effective re-establishment of the secondary barrier. The Automated Well Control and a MPD systems have recently been combined to create the first integrated package to deliver both pressure control and well control in an efficient and less error prone manner. A full rig trial was successfully performed to demonstrate and verify the integration and functionality of both systems. The Automated Well Control technology referred to above has been patented by the UK Patent Office, which recognises its ability to detect the presence of a fluid influx condition in a wellbore, make a decision against criteria to shut-in, and then automatically initiate a well control protocol that results in the safe shut-in of the well. The paper aims to describe the Automated Well Control technology and explain why the system was designed and how it works, highlighting the benefits of automating this safety critical process. © 2022",Automated Well Control; Automation; Drilling; Human factors; Safety; Well control,Digital Chemical Engineering,2022,Journal,Atchison B.,10.1016/j.dche.2022.100022
Opportunities for using eye tracking technology in manufacturing and logistics: Systematic literature review and research agenda,"Workers play essential roles in manufacturing and logistics. Releasing workers from routine tasks and enabling them to focus on creative, value-adding activities can enhance their performance and wellbeing, and it is also key to the successful implementation of Industry 4.0. One technology that can help identify patterns of worker-system interaction is Eye Tracking (ET), which is a non-intrusive technology for measuring human eye movements. ET can provide moment-by-moment insights into the cognitive state of the subject during task execution, which can improve our understanding of how humans behave and make decisions within complex systems. It also enables explorations of the subject's interaction mode with the working environment. Earlier research has investigated the use of ET in manufacturing and logistics, but the literature is fragmented and has not yet been discussed in a literature review yet. This article therefore conducts a systematic literature review to explore the applications of ET, summarise its benefits, and outline future research opportunities of using ET in manufacturing and logistics. We first propose a conceptual framework to guide our study and then conduct a systematic literature search in scholarly databases, obtaining 71 relevant papers. Building on the proposed framework, we systematically review the use of ET and categorize the identified papers according to their application in manufacturing (product development, production, quality inspection) and logistics. Our results reveal that ET has several use cases in the manufacturing sector, but that its application in logistics has not been studied extensively so far. We summarize the benefits of using ET in terms of process performance, human performance, and work environment and safety, and also discuss the methodological characteristics of the ET literature as well as typical ET measures used. We conclude by illustrating future avenues for ET research in manufacturing and logistics. © 2022 The Author(s)",Eye tracking; Human behaviour; Industry 4.0; Literature review; Logistics; Manufacturing,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,Zheng T.; Glock C.H.; Grosse E.H.,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108444
Generalized Behavior Framework for Mobile Robots Teaming With Humans in Harsh Environments,"Industrial contexts, typically characterized by highly unstructured environments, where task sequences are difficult to hard-code and unforeseen events occur daily (e.g., oil and gas, energy generation, aeronautics) cannot completely rely upon automation to substitute the human dexterity and judgment skills. Robots operating in these conditions have the common requirement of being able to deploy appropriate behaviours in highly dynamic and unpredictable environments, while aiming to achieve a more natural human-robot interaction and a broad range of acceptability in providing useful and efficient services. The goal of this paper is to introduce a deliberative framework able to acquire, reuse and instantiate a collection of behaviours that promote an extension of the autonomy periods of mobile robotic platforms, with a focus on maintenance, repairing and overhaul applications. Behavior trees are employed to design the robotic system’s high-level deliberative intelligence, which integrates: social behaviors, aiming to capture the human’s emotional state and intention; the ability to either perform or support various process tasks; seamless planning and execution of human-robot shared work plans. In particular, the modularity, reactiveness and deliberation capacity that characterize the behaviour tree formalism are leveraged to interpret the human’s health and cognitive load for supporting her/him, and to complete a shared mission by collaboration or complete take-over. By enabling mobile robotic platforms to take-over risky jobs which the human cannot, should not or do not want to perform the proposed framework bears high potential to significantly improve the safety, productivity and efficiency in harsh working environments.

Human performance in manufacturing tasks: Optimization and assessment of required workload and capabilities,"This paper discusses some examples where human performance and/or human error prediction was achieved by using a modified version of the Rasch model (1980), where the probability of a specified outcome is modelled as a logistic function of the difference between the person capacity and item difficulty. The model needs to be modified to take into account an outcome that may not be dichotomous and to take into account the interaction between two macro factors: (a) Task complexity: that summarises all factors contributing to physical and mental workload requirements for execution of a given operative task & (b) Human capability: that considered the skills, training and experience of the people facing the tasks, representing a synthesis of their physical and cognitive abilities to verify whether or not they are matching the task requirements. Task complexity can be evaluated as a mathematical construct considering the compound effects of Mental Workload Demands and Physical Workload Demands associated to an operator task. Similarly, operator capability can be estimated on the basis of the operators’ set of cognitive capabilities and physical conditions. The examples chosen for the application of the model were quite different: one is a set of assembly workstation in large computer manufacturing company and the other a set of workstations in the automotive sector.

Smooth and Resilient Human–Machine Teamwork as an Industry 5.0 Design Challenge,"Smart machine companions such as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and collaborative robots are rapidly populating the factory floor. Future factory floor workers will work in teams that include both human co-workers and smart machine actors. The visions of Industry 5.0 describe sustainable, resilient, and human-centered future factories that will require smart and resilient capabilities both from next-generation manufacturing systems and human operators. What kinds of approaches can help design these kinds of resilient human–machine teams and collaborations within them? In this paper, we analyze this design challenge, and we propose basing the design on the joint cognitive systems approach. The established joint cognitive systems approach can be complemented with approaches that support human centricity in the early phases of design, as well as in the development of continuously co-evolving human–machine teams. We propose approaches to observing and analyzing the collaboration in human–machine teams, developing the concept of operations with relevant stakeholders, and including ethical aspects in the design and development. We base our work on the joint cognitive systems approach and propose complementary approaches and methods, namely: actor–network theory, the concept of operations and ethically aware design. We identify their possibilities and challenges in designing and developing smooth human–machine teams for Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems. © 2022 by the authors.

Combining World Class Manufacturing system and Industry 4.0 technologies to design ergonomic manufacturing equipment,"In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, human has still a central role. Manufacturing industries have to deal with human sustainability in order to guarantee workers’ health and well-being. Several studies have proved the importance of ergonomics in workplace design and the benefits related to the adoption of the human-centered approach. The enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 are changing the role of the operator and can support him from a physical and cognitive point of view. On the other hand, companies are increasingly implementing lean philosophies, such as World Class Manufacturing, to maintain their competitiveness by reducing wastes and costs. However, the need arises for a comprehensive methodology to support the design of manufacturing equipment considering human factors by integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and World Class Manufacturing elements. It aims at improving both ergonomic and efficiency aspects of the workstation. The proposed methodology allows identifying and in-depth analyzing the problem, thus finding and implementing a solution that complies with all the requirements and constraints defined. Each step of the methodology can be strengthened by Industry 4.0 technologies. The methodology has been experimented in a real case study with a global company of agriculture and industrial vehicles, leading to the design and implementation of a new equipment. Relevant benefits in terms of ergonomics, efficiency, and process standardization have been achieved. © 2022, The Author(s).",Equipment design; Ergonomics; Human-centered manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Workplace organization pillar; World class manufacturing,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2022,Journal,Ciccarelli M.; Papetti A.; Cappelletti F.; Brunzini A.; Germani M.,10.1007/s12008-021-00832-7
Development of Modular and Adaptive Laboratory Set-Up for Neuroergonomic and Human-Robot Interaction Research,"The industry increasingly insists on academic cooperation to solve the identified problems such as workers' performance, wellbeing, job satisfaction, and injuries. It causes an unsafe and unpleasant working environment that directly impacts the quality of the product, workers' productivity, and effectiveness. This study aimed to give a specialized solution for tests and explore possible solutions to the given problem in neuroergonomics and human–robot interaction. The designed modular and adaptive laboratory model of the industrial assembly workstation represents the laboratory infrastructure for conducting advanced research in the field of ergonomics, neuroergonomics, and human–robot interaction. It meets the operator's anatomical, anthropometric, physiological, and biomechanical characteristics. Comparing standard, ergonomic, guided, and collaborative work will be possible based on workstation construction and integrated elements. These possibilities allow the industry to try, analyze, and get answers for an identified problem, the condition, habits, and behavior of operators in the workplace. The set-up includes a workstation with an industry work chair, a Poka–Yoke system, adequate lighting, an audio 5.0 system, containers with parts and tools, EEG devices (a cap and smartfones), an EMG device, touchscreen PC screen, and collaborative robot. The first phase of the neuroergonomic study was performed according to the most common industry tasks defined as manual, monotonous, and repetitive activities. Participants have a task to assemble the developed prototype model of an industrial product using prepared parts and elements, and instructed by the installed touchscreen PC. In the beginning, the participant gets all the necessary information about the experiment and gets 15 min of practice. After the introductory part, the EEG device is mounted and prepared for recording. The experiment starts with relaxing music for 5 min. The whole experiment lasts two sessions per 60 min each, with a 15 min break between the sessions. Based on the first experiments, it is possible to develop, construct, and conduct complex experiments for industrial purposes to improve the physical, cognitive, and organizational aspects and increase workers' productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It has highlighted the possibility of applying modular and adaptive ergonomic research laboratory experimental set-up to transform standard workplaces into the workplaces of the future.

Decoupling the influence of eco-sustainability motivations in the adoption of the green industrial IoT and the impact of advanced manufacturing technologies,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has integrated the digital and physical world, along with cognitive decision-making abilities that would not require human participation. It also represents the future trend and the next global revolution unfolding in a green industrial environment. This study aimed to decouple the effects of motivations for adopting the Green Industrial Internet of Things (GIIoT) for eco-sustainability and to evaluate its impact on green innovation (GI). The study also examined the mediating role of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) on the association between the GIIoT and GI. Data were collected online from 355 manufacturing organization employees. Analysis of the data shows that eco-sustainability motivations such as eco-efficiency, eco-effectiveness, eco-responsiveness, and eco-legitimacy lead to the adoption of the GIIoT. Empirical analysis shows that AMT mediates the relationship between GIIoT and GI. These outcomes expand and improve the current literature on the GIIoT and GI and provide practitioners with valuable insights into GI technologies that fulfill their environmental responsibilities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Eco-sustainability; Green innovation; Industrial internet; IoT,Journal of Cleaner Production,2022,Journal,Hu R.; Shahzad F.; Abbas A.; Liu X.,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130708
"Integration of human factors, cognitive ergonomics, and artificial intelligence in the human-machine interface for additive manufacturing","As additive manufacturing transitions from manufacturing prototypes to rapid manufacturing, more human factors considerations must be assessed and integrated for improved work design. This review paper provides an overview of human-machine integration for human factors, cognitive ergonomics, and artificial intelligence to improve the performance output of the additive manufacturing process. In addition, case studies are shared to provide integration concepts for artificially intelligent systems. It is anticipated that the contents of this review paper will pave the path for further research into the integration of human factors and cognitive ergonomics for artificial intelligence in additive manufacturing.

Using Bayesian belief networks to improve distributed situation awareness in shift changeovers: A case study,"This paper presents a case study about communication between workers during shift changes based on empirical research at a continuously operating industrial operation. The premises of Situation Awareness (SA) and Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) are the theoretical lens for conducting the present study. The objective of the study is the probabilistic modeling of the SA of process operators by means of complementarity among the premises of SA and DSA during shift change. The methodology used semi-structured interviews that followed a questionnaire created to categorize verbalizations at the three SA levels. Verbalizations were analyzed with the “digital humanities” approach that allowed the integrated modeling of SA using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) theory. The research was performed in an industrial plant that carried out a polymer injection process, which was classified as a physical arrangement for the continuous manufacture of products. In this process, production was conducted in three continuous shifts with one operator per shift. As a result, the BBN modeling showed the dynamic relationships among the core variables monitored, and also demonstrated the complementarity between SA and DSA. In this sense, BBN was used as a communication protocol between shifts and served as a mechanism that influences the operator's cognitive load. The developed algorithm showed an excellent performance, because it represents the conditional probability between the variables according to the operators' indications regarding the criticality and level of monitoring of the process. The modeling allowed representing the operators’ complete SA, thus promoting DSA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Bayesian Belief Network; Distributed Situation Awareness; Shift changeovers; Situation Awareness,Expert Systems with Applications,2022,Journal,Rosário C.R.; Amaral F.G.; Kuffel F.J.M.; Kipper L.M.; Frozza R.,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116039
Towards evaluating the impact of swarm robotic control strategy on operators' cognitive load,"The use of multi-robot systems is increasing in disaster response, industry, transport, and logistics. Humans will remain indispensable to control and manage these fleets of robots, particularly in safety-critical applications. However, a human operator's cognitive capacities can be challenged and exceeded as the sizes of autonomous fleets grow, and more sophisticated AI techniques can lead to opaque robot control programs. In a user study (n = 40), we explore how autonomous swarm intelligence algorithms and novel tangible interaction modalities relate to subjective and physiological indices of operator cognitive load (i.e., NASA Task Load Index, heart rate variability). Our findings suggest that there are differences in workload across conditions; however, subjective and cardiac measures appear to be sensitive to different aspects of cognitive state. The results hint at the potential of both tangible interfaces and automation to engage operators and reduce cognitive load, yet show the need for further validation of workload measures for use in studying and optimizing human-swarm interactions. © 2022 IEEE.",,"RO-MAN 2022 - 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication: Social, Asocial, and Antisocial Robots",2022,Conference,Paas A.; Coffey E.B.J.; Beltrame G.; St-Onge D.,10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900763
Identification of human errors and influencing factors: A machine learning approach,"The capability of learning from accidents from different industrial sectors could prevent similar accidents to happen. With this aim, the Multi-attribute Technological Accidents Dataset (MATA-D) has been created, using a classification focused on the relation between human errors and their influencing factors (e.g., cognitive functions, organisational and technological factors). The process of collecting new data for this dataset should be constant, not only to decrease epistemic uncertainty in human reliability data but also to reflect changes in human behaviour due to evolving technology and organisational arrangements. However, reading an accident report is a time-consuming process, which delays the learning process. For this reason, this research proposes an automated approach to train the computer on a predefined classification scheme (taxonomy), which will be called the virtual human factors classifier. The virtual classifier should support human experts to analyse accident reports for organisational, technological, and individual factors that may trigger human errors. The proposed approach is based on classifying text according to previously labelled accident reports by human experts. Two case studies are used to demonstrate how data from different sectors can be used to train the machine, providing an efficient cross-discipline knowledge transfer. The accuracy of the results is promising and comparable to the classifications provided by human experts. The proposed work demonstrated to the industry the feasibility of the use of artificial intelligence to collect data and support risk and reliability assessments, and recommendations based on the study findings are suggested for investigation agencies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Accident report data; Automated text classification; CREAM; Human factors taxonomy; Human reliability data,Safety Science,2022,Journal,Morais C.; Yung K.L.; Johnson K.; Moura R.; Beer M.; Patelli E.,10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105528
An affordable system for the teleoperation of dexterous robotic hands using Leap Motion hand tracking and vibrotactile feedback,"Using robot manipulators in contexts where it is undesirable or impractical for humans to physically intervene is crucial for several applications, from manufacturing to extreme environments. However, robots require a high degree of intelligence to operate in those environments, especially if they are not fully structured. Teleoperation compensates for this limitation by connecting the human operator to the robot using human-robot interfaces. The remotely operated sessions can also be used as demonstrations to program more powerful autonomous agents. In this article, we report a thorough user study to characterise the effect of simple vibrotactile feedback on the performance and cognitive load of the human user in performing teleoperated grasping and manipulation tasks. The experiments are performed using a portable and affordable bilateral teleoperation system that we designed, composed of a Leap Motion sensor and a custom-designed vibrotactile haptic glove to operate a 4-fingered robot hand equipped with 3-axis force sensors on the fingertips; the software packages we developed are open-source and publicly available. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback improves teleoperation and reduces cognitive load, especially for complex in-hand manipulation tasks. © 2022 IEEE.",,"RO-MAN 2022 - 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication: Social, Asocial, and Antisocial Robots",2022,Conference,Coppola C.; Solak G.; Jamone L.,10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900583
The human-robot interaction in the perspective of the new Regulation on machinery products,"The human-machine interface is traditionally the critical element in the design of machines, as it must take into account anthropometric measures, principles of cognitive ergonomics and aspects of stress and fatigue. Furthermore, this design complexity has increased with the technological evolution due to industry 4.0 that has led to a human-machine interaction without barriers as the collaborative robots designed to share the same tasks and workplace with humans in executing numerous complex and high-precision tasks leading to improve human physical ergonomics. Consequently, in order to overcome the gaps of the current legislation on safety of machinery, Directive 2006/42/EC, a new Regulation on machinery was proposed in April 2021, to take into account the risks of contact and psychological stress that can be caused by human interaction with machines designed to work with different levels of autonomy. In this scenario, ergonomics has also undergone an evolution: while before it was traditionally interested in physical and cognitive aspects in a physical world, now it turns to robotic, intelligent and autonomous systems and to the digital world. In this paper, the new issues of human-robot collaboration are considered and the way in which Human- Centred Design (HCD) aims to optimize human well-being and the overall performance of the human-robot system is outlined. It will also show how the ergonomic requirements of the new Regulation on machinery products can be met in the design of collaborative robots. © 2022 ESREL2022 Organizers.

Creating Superior Value in the Eyes of the Customer: An Analysis of the Two Generic Value Drivers and Value Paths,"Despite the considerable body of work on customer value, the literature remains highly fragmented and thus surprisingly silent on two elementary questions: (1) whether a firm should focus more strongly on the product core (a product’s basic elements) or the product surrounding (a product’s additional elements) and (2) whether a firm should focus on the cognitive path (a product’s actual value) or the intuitive path (the signaling of efforts to create a product of high value). Given the large investments required for customer value creation and firms’ increased need for cost control, the answers to these questions are especially important, as they would help managers avoid misallocation of human and financial resources and would offer valuable insights into how communication and sales activities can best support a customer value strategy. On the basis of an integrative framework and a dyadic dataset, this paper finds that the answers to these questions depend significantly on the specific product context (the type of product, extent of product commoditization, and product involvement). For example, services firms may concentrate more strongly on the product core and should particularly focus on the intuitive path. By contrast, manufacturing firms should rely more heavily on the product surrounding and may focus almost equally on the cognitive path and the intuitive path. © 2022 C.H.BECK oHG.

Human-Machine Collaboration for Smart Decision Making: Current Trends and Future Opportunities,"Recently, modeling of decision making and control systems that include heterogeneous smart sensing devices (machines) as well as human agents as participants is becoming an important research area due to the wide variety of applications including autonomous driving, smart manufacturing, internet of things, national security, and healthcare. To accomplish complex missions under uncertainty, it is imperative that we build novel human machine collaboration structures to integrate the cognitive strengths of humans with computational capabilities of machines in an intelligent manner. In this paper, we present an overview of the existing works on human decision making and human machine collaboration within the scope of signal processing and information fusion.

An information-based model to assess human cognitive capacity and information processing speed of operators in Industry 4.0,"The fourth industrial revolution introduced a new paradigm in manufacturing systems. In the new production environments, operators are supported by new digital technologies, and the physical context is strictly related to the cyber one. In the digital society, recent studies show that individuals have to perform tasks based on the information gathered by a huge amount of data and the operators are employed in more cognitive than physical tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this paper consists in developing an information-based analytical framework to assess the human cognitive capacity occupancy and the human processing time of correct information when the quality performance is known. The model has been tested on case studies. The results show its effectiveness in evaluating the human mental workload imposed by the task performed and the processing speed of correct information with varying quality performance.

Robot Trajectory Adaptation to Optimise the Trade-off between Human Cognitive Ergonomics and Workplace Productivity in Collaborative Tasks,"In hybrid industrial environments, workers' comfort and positive perception of safety are essential requirements for successful acceptance and usage of collaborative robots. This paper proposes a novel human-robot interaction framework in which the robot behaviour is adapted online according to the operator's cognitive workload and stress. The method exploits the generation of B-spline trajectories in the joint space and formulation of a multi-objective optimisation problem to online adjust the total execution time and smoothness of the robot trajectories. The former ensures human efficiency and productivity of the workplace, while the latter contributes to safeguarding the user's comfort and cognitive ergonomics. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated in a typical industrial task. Results demonstrated its capability to enhance the productivity of the human-robot dyad while mitigating the cognitive workload induced in the worker. © 2022 IEEE.",Human Factors and Human-in-the-Loop; Human-Centered Robotics; Human-Robot Collaboration,IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,2022,Conference,Lagomarsino M.; Lorenzini M.; De Momi E.; Ajoudani A.,10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981424
DEVELOPING REQUIREMENTS FOR A MANUFACTURING TRAINING PLATFORM: A THREE-PRONGED APPROACH,"The study reported in this paper is focused on training needs for manufacturing assembly line workers. Specifically, the objective is to investigate desired worker characteristics, upskilling opportunities, and need for a training platform targeted at assembly line workers in South Carolina. The study is performed in three parts: 1) a survey of South Carolina manufacturing professionals, 2) an analysis of manufacturing job ads, and 3) an analysis of publicly available data from O*NET®. The survey consisted of 27 questions and primarily focused on learning objectives within the cognitive and psychomotor domains of Bloom’s taxonomy. The survey tool was also designed to determine industry perceptions of virtual training for manual assembly operations and perceptions of its potential benefits and limitations. Specific survey questions address the desired complexity of training objectives within the cognitive and psychomotor domains. The results from this survey will later be used provide a framework for customized, targeted training modules for assembly workers. Job postings for assembly line workers were analyzed using Natural Language Processing techniques. Specifically, postings were analyzed to relate action verbs to the distinct domains of Bloom’s taxonomy of learning objectives. In addition, a frequency analysis of the verbs provided insight into skills that are in demand. Preliminary survey results were compared to results from the job ads analysis and trends from O*NET® for alignment or discrepancies between announced characteristics and desired skills. This comparison provides insights into training requirements and upskilling opportunities for the manufacturing workforce. Further possibilities include targeted semi-structured interviews to explore knowledge gaps, pursue insights, and refine results.

A Conceptual Framework of Adaptive AR-Based Digital Guidance System for High-Mix Low-Volume Manual Assembly,"In a high-mix, low-volume (HMLV) manufacturing environment, operators had long relied on paper instructions to identify product variations, which have cognitive disadvantages that digital assembly guidance and assistance systems addressed. Together with AR technology, the digitalised systems are used in guiding, training, designing and planning manual assembly. However, their implementation faces challenges arising from the high variation of products and the authoring expertise required. As easy tasks have negligible benefit under AR guidance, it is proposed that a multi-mode adaptive guidance system use AR guidance only at necessary assembly steps. This paper proposes an Adaptive Digital Guidance System for HMLV manufacturing, which includes a multi-mode assembly assist system for varying tasks complexity. The assembly information is shown adaptively based on the type of assembly process, user experience level, and task complexity. The assembly information manager application is proposed to track product variation and complexity in order to recommend appropriate instructional visual assets. The operator's experience profile will group similar product variations while tracking the user's improvement in task performance for each variant. Finally, all of these systems will be integrated into a proposed framework to create an adaptive digital guidance system.  © 2022 IEEE.",digital assembly assistant; dynamic digital instruction; Extended Reality; mass customisation; operator 4.0,"2022 27th International Conference on Automation and Computing: Smart Systems and Manufacturing, ICAC 2022",2022,Conference,Gan Z.L.; Musa S.N.; Yap H.J.; Liu C.; Xu Y.,10.1109/ICAC55051.2022.9911112
DEVELOPMENT OF A HAPTIC GLOVE FOR THE INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGERS OF THE RIGHT HAND WITH FORCE FEEDBACK,"Due to the growth in the amount and types of information that surrounds us, it is important to explore other areas and ideas and ways to interact with information. Haptic systems with their tactile, kinesthetic and motor capabilities, together with the associated cognitive processes, present a bidirectional channel of information to our brain. This channel provides a way to interact with the information with which a large number of applications can be generated. Haptics covers many disciplines; Therefore, a wide variety of applications is generated that includes those areas of human needs such as products, manufacturing, education, health, among others. For teleoperation and virtual reality applications, force feedback is important for the user, since due to this it can improve the interaction between the user's real environment and the virtual environment. For this reason, the human hand is capable of obtaining information while executing complex tasks. This has a variety of functions among the most important are the sensory and motor functions. That is why there is an interest in creating a haptic device for the hand. Haptic research and technology have created and evaluated different prototypes with their characteristics and capabilities for the use of virtual environments, some of which are currently marketed. In this way, different applications of this technology have been made in areas such as: graphical interface, medicine, games, engineering, telerobotics, simulators and medical rehabilitators. Focusing on the haptic interface for the upper limbs with force feedback, the process of integrating exoskeletons and haptic interface is a great advance to be able to transmit force to the joints of the hand. Traditional methods for the rehabilitation of patients with motor disabilities in the upper limbs are slow, costly and in many cases ineffective, considerably reducing their quality of life. Therefore, it seeks to develop a low-cost haptic force feedback technology with its three main elements: a haptic device, a computer where a virtual environment (interface) is generated, and a human operator that closes the loop, which complements the recovery of these patients and thus achieve better results. Previous studies that integrate 3D printing technologies, virtual reality (VR), microcontrollers and actuation through tensors demonstrate the successful development of different prototypes with similar characteristics, although most of them are expensive. For the development of the prototype, the V methodology was used, performing instrumentation, interface-prototype connection and force feedback tests. The integration of these subsystems after the tests, result in a final prototype of the haptic glove for two fingers (index and middle) of the right hand, managing to generate feedback forces on the user based on the information provided by the interface, complying with the characteristics of being a functional and low-cost glove.

Enhanced Cognition for Adaptive Human-Robot Collaboration,"Cyber-Physical Systems constitute one of the core concepts in Industry 4.0 aiming at realizing production systems that combine the efforts of human workers, robots, and intelligent entities. This is particularly crucial in Human-Robot Collaboration manufacturing where a tight peer-to-peer interaction between humans and intelligent autonomous robots is necessary. The work proposes the integration of novel Artificial Intelligence technologies to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of collaborative robots. The integrated functionalities allow a collaborative robot to autonomously recognize the tasks a human worker performs, and accordingly adapt its behavior. The approach is deployed on a real HRC scenario showing the functioning of the developed cognitive capabilities and the increased flexibility of resulting collaborations.  © 2022 IEEE.",Automated Planning; Human-Robot Collaboration; Knowledge Representation and Reasoning; Robot Perception,"IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA",2022,Conference,Umbrico A.; Anasagasti M.; Bezrucav S.-O.; Canale F.; Cesta A.; Corves B.; Mandischer N.; Mondragon M.; Rappis C.N.; Orlandini A.,10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921619
Designing human–system cooperation in industry 4.0 with cognitive work analysis: a first evaluation,"One objective of Industry 4.0 is to reach a better system performance as well as to have a better consideration of humans. This would be done by benefiting from knowledge and experience of humans, and balancing in a reactive way some complex or complicated tasks with intelligent systems. Several studies already dealt with such an objective, but few are done at a methodological level, which forbids, for example, the correct evaluation of design choices in terms of human awareness of the situation or mental workload when designing intelligent manufacturing systems integrating the human. Indeed, increasing the intelligence and autonomy of industrial systems and their composing entities (resources, products, robots…), as fostered by Industry 4.0, increases their overall complexity. This modification reduces the ability to understand the behaviors of these systems, and leads to the difficulty for humans not only to elaborate alternative decisions when required, but also to make effective decisions and understand their consequences. This paper evaluates such a design methodology, the Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), and its applicability when designing an assistance system to support Human in the control of Intelligent Manufacturing System in Industry 4.0. Among several functions identified through the application of CWA, the assistant system might have to integrate a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. The evaluation of the methodology through the one of the designed assistant systems is done using a micro-world, which is an intelligent manufacturing cell composed of intelligent mobile ground robots, products, and static production robots interacting together and with a human supervisor in charge of the reaching of several time-based and energy-based performances indicators. The assistant system embeds a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. Twenty-three participants took part in experiments to evaluate the designed assistance system. First results show that the assistance system enables participants to have a correct awareness of the situation and a correct evaluation of their alternative decisions, while their mental workload is managed and expected production performances are reached. This paper contains an analysis of these experiments and points out some limits of the CWA method in the context of Industry 4.0, especially the lack of tool enabling to specify clearly the cooperation processes between the supervisor and the intelligent manufacturing system. This paper concludes with potential research avenues, the main one being the potential benefits of coupling CWA with human–machine cooperation principles to fine tune and adapt the cooperation between the human and the intelligent manufacturing system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",Cognitive work analysis; Cyber-physical systems; Human–machine cooperation; Human–machine systems; Manufacturing system,"Cognition, Technology and Work",2022,Journal,Pacaux-Lemoine M.-P.; Berdal Q.; Guérin C.; Rauffet P.; Chauvin C.; Trentesaux D.,10.1007/s10111-021-00667-y
Enabling Cognitive Manufacturing in Heterogeneous Industrial Automation Systems,"With the increased digitization in the manufacturing sector, cognitive computing entails great potential to improve services and production. This is also referred to as cognitive manufacturing. The general idea is to simulate human cognitive processes-with the aim to improve decision making-by using machine learning (ML) to leverage the increased amount of data. However, the seamless adoption of cognitive computing and ML techniques to industrial automation systems on all abstraction levels is currently impeded by different challenges. Prominent blocking points are the heterogeneity of the systems, which impedes uniform data access and ML integration, and the lack of support for managing various ML life cycle phases. In this work, we propose a framework to manage data and ML life cycles in industrial automation systems. The framework comprises an architecture for the flexible integration of ML components (from component to cloud level) and their adaptive management (including retraining and updates). We address three phases of ML explicitly: pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment. We present first results and experiences of applying the framework to an industrial use case and discuss its future potential towards enabling cognitive manufacturing.  © 2022 IEEE.",Cognitive Computing; Cognitive Manufacturing; Industrial Automation; Machine Learning,"Proceedings of 2022 IEEE 21st International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing, ICCI*CC 2022",2022,Conference,My Van H.; Dreiser M.; Da Silva A.S.; Weiss G.,10.1109/ICCICC57084.2022.10101573
"Industry 4.0 vs. Industry 5.0: Co-existence, Transition, or a Hybrid","Smart manufacturing is being shaped nowadays by two different paradigms: Industry 4.0 proclaims transition to digitalization and automation of processes while emerging Industry 5.0 emphasizes human centricity. This turn can be explained by unprecedented challenges being faced recently by societies, such as, global climate change, pandemics, hybrid and conventional warfare, refugee crises. Sustainable and resilient processes require humans to get back into the loop of organizational decision-making. In this paper, we argue that the most reasonable way to marry the two extremes of automation and value-based human-driven processes is to create an Industry 4.0+Industry 5.0 hybrid, which inherits the most valuable features of both - efficiency of the Industry 4.0 processes and sustainability of the Industry 5.0 decisions. Digital cognitive clones twinning human decision-making behavior are represented as an enabling technology for the future hybrid and as an accelerator (as well as resilience enabler) of the convergence of the digital and human worlds. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Complexity based investigation in collaborative assembly scenarios via non intrusive techniques,"Human and robot collaboration in assembly tasks is an integral part in modern manufactories. Robots provide advantages in both process and productivity with their repeatability and usability in different tasks, while human operators provide flexibility and can act as safeguards. However, process complexity increases which can lower the overall quality. Increased complexity can negatively influence decision making due to cognitive load on human operators, which can lead to lower quality, be it product, process or human work. Moreover, it can lead to safety risks, human-system error and accidents. In this work, we present the preliminary results on an experiment performed with student-participants, based on an assembly task. The experiment was set up to emulate an industrial assembly, and data collection was performed through qualitative and non-intrusive quantitative methods. Questionnaires were used to assess perceptual task complexity and cognitive load, while a stereo camera provided recordings for after-task analysis on process errors and human work quality based on a 3D skeleton-based human pose estimation and tracking method. The aim of the study is to investigate causes of errors and implications on quality. Future direction of the work is discussed.  © 2022 The Authors.

Using Cognitive Work Analysis to deploy collaborative digital twins: application to predictive maintenance,"The digital twin is a technology that expands the possibilities of manufacturers thanks to its various applications, particularly for the application of predictive maintenance. In the context of Industry 4.0, technical agents such as digital twins tend towards more autonomy. Indeed, one of its characteristics lies in its partial or total capacity to act on its physical counterpart. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the digital twin and the human agent as cooperating agents. Under this perspective, decision loops between the digital twin and human agent is necessary in the deployment of the digital twin. The JUPITER project aims to develop the digital twin for predictive maintenance of the SCAP platform, a manufacturing line. The objective of this paper is to show how Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) could contribute to the definition of the allocation of the decision making activity between the digital twin and the human. Two CWA analysis were applied: the Work Domain Analysis (WDA) and the Social Organization and Cooperation Analysis with his tool Contextual Template Activity (SOCA-CAT). The functions identified by the WDA highlighted the allocation decision between the cooperative agents and the SOCA-CAT provided a contextualization of this allocation. The allocation of the decision making activity was considered in terms of the level of automation between the digital twin and the human agent. © 2022 ESREL2022 Organizers.

Ready for Industrial Use? A User Study of Spatial Augmented Reality in Industrial Assembly,"Spatial augmented reality (SAR) allows embedding instructions in the operator's field of view in manufacturing processes while hands-free working is possible. In this paper, we present the results of a field study in manufacturing to evaluate on the industrial readiness of SAR.

Framework of modular industrial assembly workstations in a collaborative environment,"Modern organizations aim to improve key economic parameters (productivity, effectiveness) in order to be competitive in global market. Furthermore, contemporary organizations strive to improve the health and safety of workers. One of the possible solutions to achieve that goal is to modernise production processes through the integration of lean principles and innovative technologies of Industry 4.0. However, in many monotonous and repetitive assembly operations, it is not possible to implement full digitalization. The focus of this research paper is to propose a modular human-robot workstation where the operator and collaborative robot share activities to improve workplace safety and worker's performance. The proposed modular assembly workstation, integrated with a poka-yoke system, is designed in accordance with the individual characteristics of the operator. Authors plan in future periods to conduct researches on this workstation in the field of neuroergonomics using an innovative electroencephalogram system (EEG) during assembly tasks with collaborative robot to prove that it will improve the physical, cognitive and organizational ergonomics and, at the same time, increase productivity and effectiveness. © 2022 ESREL2022 Organizers.

Lessons Learned from Human Pose Interaction in an Industrial Spatial Augmented Reality Application,"This paper is a technical description of a novel Augmented Reality application in the industrial domain of furniture production. In the presented case, workers suffered from high cognitive load in doing end-of-line quality inspection and individual handling of a high variety of products. The proposed solution consists of a Spatial Augmented Reality system, where a projector directly displays information on the product to assist the worker. At the same time results of an in-line quality inspections are shown which can be interactively modified through human gestures. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) in contrast to other industrial augmented reality applications the described one technically builds upon a deep neural net based pose estimation. This allows a seamless interaction with the system and tracking of human actions rather than deriving them from the current state of the work piece, (2) the paper recapitulates experiences and results of the approach with a focus on lessons learned for using human pose estimation in smart production. © 2022 The Authors.

Exploiting Virtual Reality for Enhancing the Shopping Experience in the Fashion Industry: Between Interaction and Perception,"Nowadays, buying a product online is no longer about the product itself but the experience it offers. The planned thesis work aims to understand how to improve the user's shopping experience in the context of online shopping for the fashion industry. To enhance the shopping experience, retailers need to sell new services by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR). The first part of the research investigates which shopping experience, between one developed for a desktop computer-Desktop Virtual Reality (DVR)-and one developed in Virtual Reality (VR), generates better results in terms of hedonic and utilitarian values, cognitive load, and user experience. Also, the lack of touch in online shopping is a crucial issue. The second part of the research concerns the implementation of pseudo-haptics feedback within the online shopping experience with VR. Pseudo-haptics can induce haptic sensations without requiring actual touch through the influence of other sensory modalities, such as vision. To this end, we aim to explore the feasibility of recreating the sensation of people's actual touch with fashion products and fabrics through a 'visualized touch' on an interface.  © 2022 IEEE.",Design for Interaction; E-Commerce; Empirical studies in interaction design; Human computer interaction (HCI); Human-centered computing; Interaction paradigms; Mixed/augmented reality; Pseudo-Haptics; Retail; User Experience; Virtual Reality,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct, ISMAR-Adjunct 2022",2022,Conference,Ricci M.,10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct57072.2022.00210
Smart Production and Manufacturing: A Research Field with High Potential for the Application of Neurophysiological Tools,"The concepts of Smart Production and Industry 4.0 refer to the connection of physical production with digital technology and advanced analytics to create a more holistic and flexible ecosystem. The human worker is a central element, who is mentally supported in her daily routine and decision-making processes by data-based assistive systems. Currently, there are few studies that scientifically demonstrate the effectiveness of these systems. While behavioral methods and self-report instruments are commonly used to assess cognitive workload, mental fatigue, and stress, among other variables, neurophysiological tools provide promising complementary insights. This work outlines four important application areas for the use of neurophysiology in smart production and manufacturing. The current work has the goal to instigate further research in the study domain, both theoretical and empirical. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cognitive workload; Industry 4.0; Mental fatigue; Neuroscience; Smart manufacturing; Smart production; Stress,Lecture Notes in Information Systems and Organisation,2022,Conference,Wolfartsberger J.; Riedl R.,10.1007/978-3-031-13064-9_22
Worker safety in agriculture 4.0: A new approach for mapping operator's vibration risk through Machine Learning activity recognition,"While being a fundamental driver of competitiveness in agroindustry, technological innovation has also introduced new critical elements related, for example, to the sustainability of the production processes as well as to the safety of workers. In such regard, the advent of the 4th industrial revolution (Agriculture 4.0) based on digitalization, is an unprecedented opportunity of rethinking the role of innovation in a new human-centric perspective. In particular, the establishment of an interconnected work environment and the augmentation of the operator's physical, sensorial, and cognitive capabilities, are two technologies which can be effectively employed for substantially improving the ergonomics and safety conditions on the workplace. This paper approaches such topic referring to the vibration risk, which is a well-known cause of work-related pathologies, and proposes an original methodology for mapping the risk exposure of the operators to the activities performed. A miniaturized wearable device is employed to collect vibration data, and the signals obtained are segmented in time windows and processed in order to extract the significant features. Finally, a machine learning classifier has been developed to recognize the worker's activity and to evaluate the related exposure to vibration risks. To validate the methodology proposed, an experimental analysis in real operating conditions has been finally carried out by monitoring the activities performed by a team of workers during harvesting operations. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the methodology proposed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture 4.0; Ergonomics; Machine learning; Muscoskeletal disorders; Operator safety; Vibration risk,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,2022,Journal,Aiello G.; Catania P.; Vallone M.; Venticinque M.,10.1016/j.compag.2021.106637
Digital clones and digital immunity: adversarial training handles both,"Smart manufacturing needs digital clones of physical objects (digital twins) and human decision-makers (cognitive clones). The latter requires use of machine learning to capture hidden personalised decision models from humans. Machine learning nowadays is a subject of various adversarial attacks (poisoning, evasion, etc.). Responsible use of machine learning requires digital immunity (the capability of smart systems to operate robustly in adversarial conditions). Both problems (clones and immunity training) have the same backbone solution, which is adversarial training (learning on automatically generated adversarial samples). In this study, we design and experimentally test special algorithms for adversarial samples generation to fit simultaneously both purposes: to better personalise decision models for digital clones and to train digital immunity, thus, ensuring robustness of autonomous decision models. We demonstrate that our algorithms facilitate the desired robustness and accuracy of the training process.

Introduction to the special section humans and industry 4.0,"Since the start of industrialization, machine capabilities have increased in such a way that human control of processes has evolved from simple (with mechanization) to cognitive (with computerization), and even emotional (with semi/full automation). The processes have also evolved from simple to complicated, and now complex systems, in the emerging context of Industry 4.0. The objective of the special issue “Human and Industry 4.0” is to benefit from studies and results from current manufacturing projects to highlight clues and good practices to design intelligent manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0, then paying attention to human involvements in order to unsure what it looks like in practice and how to realize these systems, especially when it comes to maintenance and operations.

Biophilic Enriched Virtual Environments for Industrial Training: a User Study,"Immersive Vimial Reality (IVR) training offers the capability to industrial workers to acquire skills and address complex tasks by immersing them in a safe and controlled virtual environment (VE). However, in the literature, IVR training is mainly based on principles of standardization and efficiency without considering the operators' well-being. A novel design approach consists of the introduction in the VE of Positive Computing to improve workers' well-being by applying the Biophilia hypothesis. In this work, we explored the possibility of introducing biophilic elements in a VE training scenario that would support psychological well-being and human potential. However, the introduction of virtual elements not related to the training task may distract operators, impairing their performance. We selected as a training scenario the assembly of a real truck engine. It is accomplished in a workstation, and operators do not interact with the surrounding VE. Therefore, we placed the training area into four different types of VEs: 3D Minimal (MIN), 3D Minimal Biophilic enriched (MIN+BIO), 3D Realistic (REAL), and 3D Realistic Biophilic enriched (REAL+BIO). We compared the MIN and REAL scenarios with the respective biophilic enriched scenarios. The performance of 40 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, object fixation time, training task accuracy, knowledge accuracy, cognitive load, and user experience. The results revealed that introducing biophilic elements in a VR training environment attracts users' attention in the idle phase of the training. In contrast, they keep concentrating on the task without worsening their performance during the task accomplishment.  © 2022 IEEE.",Biophilia Hypothesis; Industrial Training; Positive Computing; Virtual Reality,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, ISMAR 2022",2022,Conference,Gattullo M.; Laviola E.; Romano S.; Evangelista A.; Manghisi V.M.; Fiorentino M.; Uva A.E.,10.1109/ISMAR55827.2022.00035
Collaborative Remote Control of Unmanned Ground Vehicles in Virtual Reality,"Virtual reality (VR) technology is commonly used in entertainment applications; however, it has also been deployed in practical applications in more serious aspects of our lives, such as safety. To support people working in dangerous industries, VR can ensure operators manipulate standardized tasks and work collaboratively to deal with potential risks. Surprisingly, little research has focused on how people can collaboratively work in VR environments. Few studies have paid attention to the cognitive load of operators in their collaborative tasks. Once task demands become complex, many researchers focus on optimizing the design of the interaction interfaces to reduce the cognitive load on the operator. That approach could be of merit; however, it can actually subject operators to a more significant cognitive load and potentially more errors and a failure of collaboration. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative VR system to support two teleoperators working in the VR environment to remote control an uncrewed ground vehicle. We use a compared experiment to evaluate the collaborative VR systems, focusing on the time spent on tasks and the total number of operations. Our results show that the total number of processes and the cognitive load during operations were significantly lower in the two-person group than in the single-person group. Our study sheds light on designing VR systems to support collaborative work with respect to the flow of work of teleoperators instead of simply optimizing the design outcomes.  © 2022 IEEE.",Collaborative Remote Control; Unmanned Ground Vehicles; Virtual Reality,"2022 International Conference on Interactive Media, Smart Systems and Emerging Technologies, IMET 2022 - Proceedings",2022,Conference,Li Z.; Luo Y.; Wang J.; Pan Y.; Yu L.; Liang H.-N.,10.1109/IMET54801.2022.9929783
The Evaluation of Gait-Free Locomotion Methods with Eye Movement in Virtual Reality,"As VR becomes increasingly popular in the entertainment industry, VR locomotion, a technique that allows users to navigate virtual environments beyond the spatial confines of the real world, is being increasingly studied by developers and researchers. Previous work has examined the effects of locomotion methods on various aspects of users, such as user experience, motion sickness, and task performance. However, how locomotion methods affect users' eye movements that might indicate cognitive load has not yet been in-vestigated, although several relevant works have addressed these effects as being important to study. To contribute to this area of research, in this work we investigate the evaluation of five common gait-free locomotion methods using eye movements during VR nav-igation. The results show that locomotion methods significantly affect participants' eye movement behavior (i.e., blinks, fixations, and saccades), suggesting that different cognitive responses were elicited with different locomotion methods. Our research provides a viable tool for future studies evaluating locomotion methods, thus providing further in-depth insights for developing more effective and enjoyable VR locomotion methods.  © 2022 IEEE.",cognitive load; eye tracking; Human-centered computing-Human computer interaction (HCI)-Interaction paradigms-Virtual reality; locomotion methods; Virtual reality,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct, ISMAR-Adjunct 2022",2022,Conference,Gao H.; Frommelt L.; Kasneci E.,10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct57072.2022.00112
Mimicking human autonomy in industrial robotic enabled sensing,"Humans have an immediate perception of shapes and surroundings through their senses and their cognitive capabilities. This innate ability enables the manual inspection of components in manufacturing environments. Trained inspectors combine their senses and handling skills with bespoke nondestructive testing instrumentation. However, manual inspections can be slow for large and/or complex geometries and prone to human factors. Automated non-destructive testing systems have emerged in recent years, to increase data acquisition speed, part coverage and inspection reliability. These tools work well when the robotic inspection takes place in a well-structured environment and an accurate part model is available. However, precisely registering the position of a part in the robot reference system makes the inspection setup very time-consuming. Furthermore, the geometry of a part may differ from its digital model, spoiling the inspection accuracy. This work introduces a new approach that mimics the human perception capability and gives full manipulation autonomy to robotic sensing applications. We use a single robotized sensor to introduce a fully autonomous single-pass geometric and volumetric inspection of complex parts. Our approach can be used to solve some key challenges in quality assurance for Industry 4.0 and can find applicability beyond robotic nondestructive testing. © 2022 IEEE.",,"RO-MAN 2022 - 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication: Social, Asocial, and Antisocial Robots",2022,Conference,Mineo C.; Cerniglia D.; Maniscalco U.,10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900651
Industry 5.0: From Manufacturing Industry to Sustainable Society,"Industry 4.0 brought a new revolution in industries by making them fully automated via innovative technologies, without considering human-power. Industry 4.0 aims to establish 'smart manufacturing industry' by emphasizing on Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IOT), Cyber Physical System (CPS), Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Robotics. This highly automated industry neglected human's intellectual and cognitive skills, causing an increase in unemployment rate and devastation of ecosystem. In this paper, we proposed a framework of emerging technologies of Industry 5.0. Here, we examined how Industry 5.0 will further extend the development of Industry 4.0 and how humans can contribute to its manufacturing process. In addition, prestigious and significant skills for workforce in manufacturing industry are also explored. We also investigated how the Covid-19 epidemic was associated to Industry 5.0 and the idea of sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Cognition-driven Robot Decision Making Method in Human-robot Collaboration Environment,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is an important method for manufacturing industry to realize intelligent and flexible production. While robots partially replace human labor, they improve production efficiency and accelerate the process of intellectualization. However, in the human-robot collaboration system, when humans and robots need to perform frequent collaborative operations, the execution of cobot actions is plagued by the robot's inability to know the trend of human behavior in advance, which in turn leads to decision delays or decision errors. In this regard, a cognition-driven robot decision-making method in a human-robot collaboration environment is proposed to divided acceptance, rejection and delay regions for decision values, and use a process of dynamic adjustment of decision values and region boundaries to simulate the human decision-making process to achieve robot decision cognition. At the same time, a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to optimize the decision boundary values based on the reward function to improve the cognitive efficiency and arrive at the final decision results as soon as possible. Finally, we take the assembly process of engine end cover as the goal of the cooperative task, and find that the efficiency is improved compared with the cooperative method based on attitude recognition. © 2022 IEEE.",cognition processing; human-robot collaboration; reinforcement learning; three-way decision,IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering,2022,Conference,Zhang R.; Li X.; Zheng Y.; Lv J.; Li J.; Zheng P.; Bao J.,10.1109/CASE49997.2022.9926617
Behavior Trees based Flexible Task Planner Built on ROS2 Framework,"As modern industrial robotic systems become smarter and more flexible, they are rather tailored for specific, large-scale applications, making its implementation too complex and costly for smaller operators. The ACROBA project aims to develop and demonstrate a novel concept of cognitive robotic platforms based on a modular approach able to be smoothly adapted to virtually any industrial scenario applying agile manufacturing principles. The flexible task planner introduced here is developed as part of this European project. It aims at providing a user-friendly tool allowing the user to reconfigure the robotic cell in quick and cheap way. The main characteristics of the task planner are the behavior tree-based control (which avoids the implementation of complex Functional States Machines), the embedded HMI interface (providing basic functionalities like start, pause, resume, manual selection of skill to run...), the embedded PDDL solver (which allows the task planner to automatically rewrite the task at run time based on factory or sensors inputs), an easy interface with a GUI to design the task manually, and a work-in-progress Assembly Sequence Planner (ASP)  © 2022 IEEE.",ASP; behavior tree; HMI; PDDL; robotic task planning; ROS,"IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA",2022,Conference,Ribeaud T.; Sprenger C.Z.,10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921683
RESEARCH OF TASK COMPLEXITY DECISION SYSTEM FOR MANUAL ASSEMBLY TASKS USING FUZZY COGNITIVE MAPS TO CONSTRUCT BAYESIAN NETWORKS,"With the evolution towards intelligent manufacturing, Industry 4.0 has revolutionized and gradually improved product quality and efficiency. When applied to the assembly sector, Assembly 4.0 has also attracted widespread attention. Assembly 4.0 requires lean production, automated learning, and the ability to solve real-time design decisions through technology and convert the direct labor of operators into management information and decisions. Therefore, to better assess the complexity of manual assembly tasks, we believe it is necessary to build a multi-view and multi-dimensional decision-making system from the perspective of manual assembly. For this purpose, we propose in this study, a Bayesian network model based on fuzzy cognitive maps. Simultaneously, we use Genie3.0 to build the Bayesian network model. For optimum quantization parameter values as well as conditional probability directions' optimization between the parent node and the child node of the Bayesian network, we use the max-min hill-climbing (MMHC) algorithm and the Expectation Maximum (EM) algorithm. The influencing factors can be managed through the Bayesian network using this model, and the users can fully understand the changing rules among task complexity factors. This model can also provide theoretical and technical support for users, starting from the initial stage of product conception down to the completion of production. © 2022 by ASME.",Bayesian Network; Manual Assembly Tasks; Task Complexity,"ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)",2022,Conference,Zhao X.; Zheng S.,10.1115/IMECE2022-93881
Probabilistic Risk Analysis of Human Failure on Fluid Penetrant Inspection via CAPEMO Causal Model.,"Fluid Penetrant Inspection relies so much on the cognitive, skill, and attitudinal aspects of human performance that the risks of process failure are very high. Previous studies were focused on identifying risks in Fluid Penetration Inspection, but none explicitly focused on the Human Reliability Analysis. The purpose of this paper is to use the CAPEMO (Causal Model for Probabilistic risk analysis in Manufacturing Operation) to conduct a probabilistic analysis of the chances of a human error during the inspection process. An in-depth literature review was conducted to identify risk factors and validate by specialists. Bayesian Network was utilized to assess the risk factors that contributed to the pivotal event. Goal-Tree Success-Tree was used to define additional barriers to the NonDestructive Testing process. As result, this study confirmed that implementing systematic barriers to mitigate risks of human errors significantly reduced the probability of such Risk. Actions proposed to mitigate the risks caused by human factors are connected to Environment Control, Organization Factors, Skills & Capacity. The proposed method has been proved to be adequate to reduce the probability of an Operator failure and can be used in practice to identify the Risk of human errors that can impact the results of the Non-Destructive Testing inspection. © 2022 ESREL2022 Organizers.

Utilizing Text Analysis in Systematic Review Design: Perceptual and Cognitive Barriers to Adoption of Robotic and Automated Systems in Construction,"Construction, the last major analog and craft manufacturing industry, is showing early signs of industrialization through the emergence of new robotic and automated systems that can perform construction tasks in situ. While much is understood about the technical and economic challenges to be overcome for widespread adoption of robotics, less is known about the human barriers to adoption, and much less is summarized. Considering the amount of human cooperation required by existing robotic applications, a comprehensive review of barriers that are cognitive or perceptual in nature using a systematic literature assessment methodology is warranted. However, such a review is not straightforward to design. While matters of cognition and perception as pertinent to construction and automation may be queried directly from the literature, there is no certainty that a review based on directly querying abstract phenomena (i.e., perception) could be comprehensive. Thus, systematically reviewing this topic calls for a robust methodology for the design of database queries. In this paper, we perform text analysis with the quanteda package for R in order to (1) understand the language composition of an initial review corpus, and (2) with that understanding design further queries to capture additional articles otherwise not possible through standard query design. Findings indicate that performing text analysis on a systematic review design can produce valuable insight into a review corpus and inform queries that capture additional unique literature relevant to the review. © 2022 ASCE.",automation; construction; Systematic review; text analysis,"Construction Research Congress 2022: Computer Applications, Automation, and Data Analytics - Selected Papers from Construction Research Congress 2022",2022,Conference,Seh-Taylor E.; McCarty C.; Sam M.; Franz B.,10.1061/9780784483961.075
Innovative safety zoning for collaborative robots utilizing Kinect and LiDAR sensory approaches,"Safe collaboration between a robotic and human agent is an important challenge yet to be fully overcome in a manufacturing set-up. Existing strategies, including safety zoning are sub-optimal since they seldom fully exploit the capabilities of the collaborative robot (for repetitive tasks) and highly cognitive tasks (best suited for the operator). The recently released ISO 15066 standard for collaborative robots proposes varying safeguards, including force, speed and distance limiting functions. The latter is particularly attractive as it allows the robotic agent to adapt its operating behaviour in proximity of the operator and in instances likely to lead to safety hazards. This paper discusses strategies explored for implementing dynamic zoning in shared workspaces, considering the input speed/force of the robot as dependent on the distance between human and robot. Two main strategies were modelled, for implementing zoning. The first strategy explored integrating a LiDAR sensor, and utilising LiDAR data to dynamically map the separation distances between the operator and robotic agent. The second strategy explores an experimental setup utilising the Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor for capturing 3D point clouds, and in turn, detecting objects/agents and the proximity distance. In both instances, objects/agents were detected up to a separation distance threshold, considering error sensitivity below values of 0.1 meters. Both use cases were demonstrated using a Yumi robot and form the basis of future work towards dynamic workspace zoning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

An IIoT Platform For Human-Aware Factory Digital Twins,"In the context of the Industry 4.0 approach, applications and solutions supporting monitoring, simulation, optimisation and decision-making in production systems are exponentially growing. These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT - industrial internet of things - based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits. © 2022 The Authors.

Cognitive Digital Twins for Resilience in Production: A Conceptual Framework,"Digital Twins (DTs) are a core enabler of Industry 4.0 in manufacturing. Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs), as an evolution, utilize services and tools towards enabling human-like cognitive capabilities in DTs. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for implementing CDTs to support resilience in production, i.e., to enable manufacturing systems to identify and handle anomalies and disruptive events in production processes and to support decisions to alleviate their consequences. Through analyzing five real-life production cases in different industries, similarities and differences in their corresponding needs are identified. Moreover, a connection between resilience and cognition is established. Further, a conceptual architecture is proposed that maps the tools materializing cognition within the DT core together with a cognitive process that enables resilience in production by utilizing CDTs. © 2022 by the authors.

Deliberative robotics – a novel interactive control framework enhancing human-robot collaboration,"Deliberative robots adapt their behavior from cobot to industrial arms as a result of the interaction dynamic with the human teammates and production context. This powerful capability is instrumental to boost robots' adoption within typically manual manufacturing contexts, by enhancing productivity while preserving human safety and job quality. The deliberative feature relies upon a modular planning and control infrastructure linked to a behavioral tree framework determining the robot response to the operating context and the human physical and cognitive status. The benefits of the approach have been validated through an industrial use case demanding enhanced human-robot collaboration in the electronics assembly value chain. © 2022 CIRP",Deliberative control; Human safety; Human-robot collaboration,CIRP Annals,2022,Journal,"Valente A., (2); Pavesi G.; Zamboni M.; Carpanzano E., (1)",10.1016/j.cirp.2022.03.045
Emerging architecture for heterogeneous smart cyber-physical systems for industry 5.0,"Industrial process automation is becoming more advance due to the new technological revolutions like Industrial Internet of things (IIoT), Machine to Machine Communication (M2M), cloud computing, cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and big little multicore-based ARM processors for embedded applications. Modern IP-enabled sensors, actuators, and controllers are transforming industrial automation into industry 5.0 compliances to attain full autonomy with minimal human intervention. With these emerging technologies, Smart Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) is the most important part of the fourth industrial revolution, where diffident programmed embedded systems are networked together to perform, computation, communication, control, and actuation. In this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous architecture for SCPS, where different electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes can be integrated to execute hybrid process dynamics. The proposed architecture is enabled to separate all aspects like computation, control, communication, and actuation, of a process dynamic by estimating the process disturbances, sensor delay, actuator delay, and conversion delay. The allotment of computational embedded cores to different physical processes is done through voltage frequency islands (VFI) with high modularity which is different for different processes. All the mapped process dynamics are optimized through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). The best implementation of the proposed architecture is the upcoming era of industry 5.0 where human intervention is also in a fold in various industries like petroleum, fertilizer, paper, cement, space exploration, and automobile manufacturing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Cyber-physical systems; Design automation; DVFS control; System synchronization,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2021,Journal,Thakur P.; Kumar Sehgal V.,10.1016/j.cie.2021.107750
A scoping method for human performance integrity and reliability assessment in process industries,"An approach to manage human performance related risks in petrochemical sector is to use human reliability analyses (HRA) techniques. However, the focus of HRAs on individuals and on decomposed tasks overlooks the likelihood that collective actions and behaviors might lead to system failures. This study introduces an alternative approach, referred to as Human Performance Integrity (HPI) index, to assess human performance conditions on the whole, as they relate to safety, in petrochemical facilities. Additionally, the approach is used to rate installations in terms of their defenses against safety-relevant human failures. The HPI index is built upon the notions of Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method. By means of a 42-question survey, data was collected on the factors that improve or reduce human performance in 11 oil refineries. Data was used to assess the facilities' safety performance. Results were compared against information obtained from relevant investigation reports, as well as and an independent evaluation of the facilities carried out by certified auditors. Findings support the use of HPI index from novice and experienced scholars and/or practitioners as a quick and effortless, yet sound and efficient manner to assess safety and reliability performance of oil refineries from a human factors perspective. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers",CREAM; expert judgment; human performance integrity; oil refineries; questionnaire survey; safety assessment,Process Safety Progress,2021,Journal,Kyriakidis M.; Dang V.N.,10.1002/prs.12260
System of Robot Learning from Multi-Modal Demonstration and Natural Language Instruction,"Collaborative robots are set to play an important role in the future of the manufacturing industry. They need to be able to work outside of the fencing and perform new tasks to individual customer specifications. The necessity of frequent robot re-programming is a great challenge for small and medium sized companies alike. Learning from demonstration is a promising approach that aims to enable robots to acquire from their end users new task knowledge consisting of a sequence of actions, the associated skills, and the context in which the task is executed. Current systems have limited support for integrating semantics and environmental changes. This paper introduces a system combining several modalities as demonstration interfaces, including natural language instruction, visual observation and hand-guiding, which enables the robot to learn a task comprising a goal concept, a plan and basic actions, with consideration for the current environment state. The task thus learned can then be generalized to similar tasks involving different initial and goal states. © 2022 The Authors.

A visual reasoning-based approach for mutual-cognitive human-robot collaboration,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) allows seamless communication and collaboration between humans and robots to fulfil flexible manufacturing tasks in a shared workspace. Nevertheless, existing HRC systems lack an efficient integration of robotic and human cognitions. Empowered by advanced cognitive computing, this paper proposes a visual reasoning-based approach for mutual-cognitive HRC. Firstly, a domain-specific HRC knowledge graph is established. Next, the holistic manufacturing scene is perceived by visual sensors as a temporal graph. Then, a collaborative mode with similar instructions can be inferred by graph embedding. Lastly, mutual-cognitive decisions are immersed into the Augmented Reality execution loop for intuitive HRC support. © 2022 The Author(s)",Human robot collaboration; Manufacturing system; Visual reasoning,CIRP Annals,2022,Journal,"Zheng P.; Li S.; Xia L.; Wang L., (1); Nassehi A., (1)",10.1016/j.cirp.2022.04.016
Designing Internet of Behaviors Systems,"The Internet of Behaviors (IoB) puts human behavior at the core of engineering intelligent connected systems. IoB links the digital world to human behavior to integrate human-driven design, development, and adaptation processes. This paper defines the novel IoB concept with a constructed model based on a collective effort interacting with software engineers, human-computer interaction scientists, social scientists, and cognitive science communities. The model for IoB is created based on an exploratory study that synthesizes state-of-the-art analysis and experts interviews. The architecture of a real industry 4.0 manufacturing infrastructure helps to explain the IoB model and its application. The conceptual model was used to successfully implement a socio-technical infrastructure for a crowd monitoring and queue management system for the Uffizi Galleries, Florence, Italy. The experiment, which started in the fall of 2016 and was operational in the fall of 2018, used a data-driven approach to feed the system with real-time sensory data. It also incorporated prediction models on visitors' mobility behavior. The system's main objective was to capture human behavior, model it, and build a mechanism that considers changes, adapts in real-time, and continuously learns from repetitive behaviors. In addition to the conceptual model and the real-life evaluation, this paper provides recommendations from experts and gives future directions for IoB to become a significant technological advancement in the coming years.  © 2022 IEEE.",Crowd Management; Cultural Heritage; HCI; HITL; Human Behavior Modeling; Intelligent Systems; IoB; IoT; Software Engineering,"Proceedings - IEEE 19th International Conference on Software Architecture, ICSA 2022",2022,Conference,Moghaddam M.T.; Muccini H.; Dugdale J.; Kjagaard M.B.,10.1109/ICSA53651.2022.00020
Machine-Vision-Based Intelligent Manufacturing by Fine-Grained Point Cloud Identification,"Traditional manufacturing system inspections are primarily conducted through microtools. Nowadays, the size of consciously manufactured parts that is getting smaller and smaller, wherein unwritten methods are subject to subjectivity, often resulting in reckless deviations. It is necessary to develop a highly efficient and correct discovery technique. Given the leaned flexibility of traditional manufacturability analysis methods based on cognitive notoriety and empire foundation, the reality that existing manufacturability analysis methods based on full scientific support cannot give a specific purpose for capability manufacturability. A deep cognition support framework grants the manufacturability analysis example. Manufacturing separative methods are presented as imitate. First, a large enumeration of 3D CAD plan with specific manufacturability are made by digital modeling technology, wherein the tier genealogy is realized to cause the data adjustments required for thorough academics. Then, concavity-oriented designs are established on the PointNet entangle form manufacturability. Dense learned grids were analyzed, and network parameter tuning and management were done; then comparisons with voxel-representation-enabled three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) and existing methods revealed detailed literature for fabricating networks with better robustness and lower algorithm cycle complexity; finally, the actual completion of the network is verified through the example section, and the manufacturability of the cave shape is analyzed to identify the unmanufacturable overall form and explain its considerations. The experimental results have shown that the rule can determine the specific reasons for the unmanufacturable shape under the condition of ensuring the complete notification accuracy ratio, and has a great reproducibility value.  © 2022 Yinhai Li et al.",,Applied Bionics and Biomechanics,2022,Journal,Li Y.; Wang F.; Jiang Y.,10.1155/2022/5627959
Innovative robotization of manual manufacturing processes,"Manufacturing industries are continually challenged to adapt to a competitive environment. Consequently, there is an urgency to opt for automation technologies to upgrade their manufacturing facilities and make them more flexible. Especially this relates to automating manual manufacturing processes, which is often challenging to structure to ensure repetitiveness and generalization to other processes within the facility. Consequently, innovating systematic approaches to identify robotization opportunities is an interesting proposition for manufacturing set-ups that would like to integrate collaborative robots on the shop floor and struggle with the decision steps to follow. In this paper, a framework for supporting robotization effort for manufacturing set-ups is proposed. The methodology consisting of five phases, culminating in the identification of robotization opportunities. A case for manual milling manufacturing processes is demonstrated as a 'proof-of-concept'. The first step of the proposed approach focuses on task decomposition, in which manual manufacturing tasks are characterized. This is followed by task allocation to a robot and human agent based on intrinsic characteristics of the task to capabilities of the agent. Next, alternative layout configurations for candidate cell layouts are generated. In the final step, a candidate layout is selected and modeled in an agent-based simulation platform, considering factors such as realism, interaction safety between the robot and human agent, and interesting manufacturing metrics such as resource utilization and throughput rate. A final configuration is optimized, which visualizes a collaborative robot performs loading and unloading tasks alongside an operator performing highly cognitive tasks. For safety, zoning of the manufacturing cell is visualized, considering a working area separated by a safety fence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Complementary learning-team machines to enlighten and exploit human expertise,The benefits of Industry 4.0 are limited by the large computational requirements of ever-larger digital models of complex production systems. A complementary learning paradigm is thus proposed to cultivate knowledge in a team of machines and humans that represents the key to a high-performance manufacturing system. Two types of knowledge are created using light-weighted neural networks and meta-learning: general knowledge of tasks and specific knowledge on collaboration with humans given few interactions. AI-based teaming strategies are designed to enable machines to leverage human expertise in making decisions using local communications that make intricate sensor systems and expensive computation unnecessary. © 2022 CIRP,Artificial intelligence; Cognitive robotics; Human robot collaboration; Machine learning,CIRP Annals,2022,Journal,"Li X.; Koren Y., (1); Epureanu B.I.",10.1016/j.cirp.2022.04.019
Method for Evaluation and Application of Production Process Chain Complexity in Sewing Workshops considering Human Factor,"Existing methods for evaluating manufacturing process chain complexity consider the number of machines, state of machines, number of parts, operation time, and processing sequence of parts. However, such evaluation methods ignore human factors. To consider human factors, human cognitive decision-making process factors are considered in the complexity evaluation of production processes. Accordingly, a new objective evaluation method of the human factor complexity is proposed. In the proposed method, sewing operations are taken as an example, and the human factor complexity is classified into perceived and cognitive complexity. Information entropy is used to measure cognitive complexity according to the type and quantity of sewing workers' cognitive activities. The results show that various methods have significant differences in the evaluation of the complexity level of the production process chain. Specifically, the calculation results of the proposed evaluation method are much greater than those of other methods. This indicates that human cognitive and perceived complexities account for a large proportion. Therefore, human factor complexity cannot be omitted. © 2022 Huimin Li et al.",,Complexity,2022,Journal,Li H.; Kong F.; Chen T.; Kong L.,10.1155/2022/4075358
Preparing datasets of surface roughness for constructing big data from the context of smart manufacturing and cognitive computing,"In smart manufacturing, human-cyber-physical systems host digital twins and IoT-based net-works. The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as CNC machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers; that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins to solve surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical system-friendly big data is a critical issue. However, preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for digital twins’ input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human-and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method. The method will be extended to the manufacturing processes in the next phase of this study. © 2021 by the authors.

Outlook on human-centric manufacturing towards Industry 5.0,"The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Human-centric human-robot collaboration; Human-centric manufacturing; Human-machine relationship; Industrial Human Needs Pyramid; Industry 5.0; Self-organizing manufacturing,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,Lu Y.; Zheng H.; Chand S.; Xia W.; Liu Z.; Xu X.; Wang L.; Qin Z.; Bao J.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.02.001
User-Centered Back-Support Exoskeleton: Design and Prototyping,"Exhausting manual labor is still predominant in the industrial context. It typically consists in manipulating heavy parts or working in non-ergonomic conditions. The resulting work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem to tackle. The most-affected body section is the the lumbar spine. Recently, exoskeletons have been identified as a possible non-invasive solution to reduce the impact of low-back pain. State-of-the-art prototypes have been optimized to: follow unconstrained human kinematics, (partially) relieve the load on assisted joints, and allow anthropometric adaptation. Yet, this technology still has limited adoption. Manufacturing optimization may address the following limitations: bulky/heavy resulting designs, complex assembly and maintenance, high manufacturing costs, long procedures for adaptation and wearing, and psychological effects (e.g., cognitive load and usability). In this contribution, the aforementioned issues are tackled improving a previous low-back exoskeleton prototype. In particular, kinematic analysis, Finite-Element-Method, and topological optimization have been combined to obtain a lightweight prototype, testing different materials (Nylon, carbon-fiber reinforced PC/ABS, etc.). We applied both Design for Assembly and Design for Manufacturability. The resulting exoskeleton prototype is described in the paper, ready for end-user field tests. © 2022 The Authors.

A head mounted augmented reality design practice for maintenance assembly: Toward meeting perceptual and cognitive needs of AR users,"Head Mounted Display (HMD) based Augmented Reality (AR) is being increasingly used in manufacturing and maintenance. However, limited research has been done to understand user interaction with AR interfaces, which may lead to poor usability, risk of occupational hazards, and low acceptance of AR systems. This paper uses a theoretically-driven approach to interaction design to investigate the impact of different AR modalities in terms of information mode (i.e. video vs. 3D animation) and interaction modality (i.e. hand-gesture vs. voice command) on user performance, workload, eye gaze behaviours, and usability during a maintenance assembly task. The results show that different information modes have distinct impacts compared to paper-based maintenance, in particular, 3D animation led to a 14% improvement over the video instructions in task completion time. Moreover, insights from eye gaze behaviours such as number of fixations and transition between Areas of Interest (AOIs) revealed the differences in attention switching and task comprehension difficulty with the choice of AR modalities. While, subjective user perceptions highlight some ergonomic issues such as misguidance and overreliance, which must be considered and addressed from the joint cognitive systems’ (JCSs) perspective and in line with the predictions derived from the Multiple Resources Model. © 2021",Augmented reality; Eye gaze behaviours; Head-mounted display; Joint cognitive system; Multiple resource model; Usability,Applied Ergonomics,2022,Conference,Ariansyah D.; Erkoyuncu J.A.; Eimontaite I.; Johnson T.; Oostveen A.-M.; Fletcher S.; Sharples S.,10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103597
A deep learning-based worker assistance system for error prevention: Case study in a real-world manual assembly,"Modern assembly systems adapt to the requirements of customised and short-lived products. As assembly tasks become increasingly complex and change rapidly, the cognitive load on employees increases. This leads to the use of assistance systems for manual assembly to detect and avoid human errors and thus ensure consistent product quality. Most of these systems promise to improve the production environment but have hardly been studied quantitatively so far. Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision have also not yet been fully exploited. This study aims to provide architectural, and implementational details of a state-of-the-art assembly assistance system based on an object detection model. The proposed architecture is intended to be representative of modern assistance systems. The error prevention potential is determined in a case study in which test subjects manually assemble a complex explosion-proof tubular lamp. The results show 51 % fewer assembly errors compared to a control group without assistance. Three of the four considered types of error classes have been reduced by at least 42 %. In particular, errors by omission are most likely to be prevented by the system. The reduction in the error rate is observed over the entire period of 30 consecutive product assemblies, comparing assisted and unassisted assembly. Furthermore, the recorded assembly data are found to be valuable regarding traceability and production improvement processes. © 2021 Production Engineering Institute.

New perspectives and results for Smart Operators in industry 4.0: A human-centered approach,"Digital solutions (including Extended Reality as well as web, mobile and AI technologies), among others, are entering a broad variety of industries and modifying the capabilities of operators through (close to) real-time display of context-dependent information. However, little is known with respect to two major issues: (i) how these technologies can be seamlessly integrated for product/process and overall manufacturing system management providing of syntactic, semantic and functional interoperability and reusability among the different manufacturing systems departments; (ii) how they can be conveyed to operators also taking into account the cognitive load that is incurred by the operators. To this end, starting from a previous article (Longo et al., 2017), this article designs and proposes the KNOW4I approach and its practical implementation in an ICT platform (the KNOW4I platform) to further empower the Smart Operators concept. Two major objectives are pursued. The former is to set a standard referred to as the KNOW4I methodological approach for knowledge representation, knowledge management and digital contents management within the Smart Operator domain. The latter is the implementation of the aforementioned approach as part of the KNOW4I platform that includes a suite of Smart Utilities and Objects intelligently and interactively linked with a newly released version of the Sophos-MS digital and intelligent Assistant.

Research on Cobot Action Decision-Making Method Based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set and Game Theory,"The bounded rational properties of humans in human-robot collaboration (HRC) is a fundamental reason for collisions in proximity HRC. As HRC scenarios in manufacturing become increasingly popular, robot action decision-making needs to consider such properties of humans. In previous studies, humans are usually regarded as rational agents whose behaviors are predictable and planned. Still, humans are susceptible to distractions caused by external disturbances, and different cognitive processes of the task can produce unpredictable behaviors. To better simulate human bounded rational behavior, based on an intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) multi-attribute decision algorithm, we propose a cobot action decision-making method that integrates human intention, safety, and efficiency, to produce a human-like decision. We use the IF set to calculate the score and accuracy values of two Nash equilibria of a static chicken game, which can predict human action intentions with collision risk and provide optimal action decisions for the robot simultaneously. We generated 10,000 sets of data using the Monte Carlo method and validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it with MDP and POMDP methods. The results showed that the decision-making method could effectively perform the task of making action decisions for the robot. Simulation experiments and Turing test results show that our proposed method can predict a human's subjective action decision intention in a situation with potential collision risk with 85.62% accuracy. At the same time, the experimental participants believe that the robot can get 4.83 out of 5 satisfaction points for an action decision. © 2013 IEEE.",Bounded rationality; cumulative prospect theory; decision-making; game theory; human action intention; human-robot collaboration; intuitionistic fuzzy set,IEEE Access,2022,Journal,Liu B.; Fu W.; Wang W.; Gao Z.; Li R.; Peng L.; Du H.; Chen X.,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3205305
Methodology to integrate ergonomics information in contextualized digital work instructions,"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), often caused by working in non-ergonomic circumstances, are the most important category of work-related diseases. Different methods exist for examining ergonomics through a variety of postural evaluation techniques (e.g. Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA)), which are mostly performed through manual survey-based observations. Consequently, measuring ergonomics of operators is time-consuming and happens only sporadically, often after problems occur. Furthermore, as an ergonomist must assign a score to the performed activity, the ergonomics evaluation is subjective. These problems can be resolved by continuous and automated ergonomic load monitoring methods that directly provide feedback to operators. In order to monitor the operator without interfering the task at hand, a vision-based ergonomics monitoring system is developed. Here, ergonomic features (e.g. joint angles) are estimated based on multiple video streams, which are used to calculate an objective ergonomic score using a standard ergonomics evaluation technique. Although cognitive operator support systems (i.e. digital work instructions) for manual assembly environments are widely used, they do typically not include ergonomics information. The goal of the methodology presented in this work is to a) formulate or update digital work instructions, b) provide the operator feedback on its ergonomic soundness via work instructions and c) generate ergonomic risk level reports in an automated way based on the outcomes of the vision-based ergonomics evaluator. Making the ergonomic guidelines context-aware ensures that interventions occur at the right time. The methodology is integrated in a framework for context-aware work instructions and is validated via a proof of concept, based on an actual industrial case. Results show that context-awareness enhances user acceptance and ergonomics of the operator. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Artificial General Intelligence vs. Industry 4.0: Do They Need Each Other?,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is known to be a driving force behind the Industry 4.0. Nowadays the current hype on development and industrial adoption of the AI systems is mostly associated with the deep learning, i.e., with the abilities of the AI to perform various specific cognitive activities better than humans do. However, what about the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), associated with the generic ability of a machine to perform consciously any task that a human can? Do we have many samples of the AGI research adopted by Industry 4.0 and used for smart manufacturing? In this paper, we report the systematic mapping study regarding the AGI-related papers (published during the five-year period) to find out whether AGI is giving up its positions within AI as an attractive tool to address the industry needs. We show what the major concerns of the AGI academic community are nowadays and how the AGI findings have been already or could be potentially applied within the Industry 4.0. We have discovered that the gap between the AGI studies and the industrial needs is still high and even has some indications to grow.

Cognitive and metabolic workload assessment techniques: A review in automotive manufacturing context,"Ergonomics assessment in the automotive industry has, to date, focused mainly on physical ergonomics, for example, manual handling and posture. However, workload and, in particular, metabolic and cognitive workload, contributes to worker efficiency but has not received sufficient attention to yield practical guidance for industry. Successful workload assessment requires in-depth understanding of the context in which it will be conducted and of the various assessment techniques which will be applied, with consideration given to factors such as feasibility, resources, and skill of the assessor. These requirements are met with challenges within large and complex organizations and are often dealt with in a piecemeal and isolated matter (i.e., reactive workload assessment). The present paper explores these challenges within the automotive manufacturing industry and aims to develop a decision matrix to guide effective selection of workload assessment techniques focused on metabolic and cognitive demands. It also presents the requirements for time, equipment, and knowledge to implement these techniques as part of a participatory ergonomics approach. Early findings suggest that most assessment techniques reviewed require further development, for example, to establish the acceptance criteria for the specific workload scenario. However, five methods (Garg, Borg RPE, IPAQ, SWAT, and NASA-TLX) are ready to use in certain applications. Ultimately, the findings suggest that it is possible to implement a participatory workload evaluation program within large and complex manufacturing plants. © 2021 The Authors.

A knowledge graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive manufacturing,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) interconnects a large number of interconnected sensors, actuators, and edge computing devices in the manufacturing systems, where the massive data collected in the manufacturing process has the characteristics of multi-dimensional, heterogeneous, and time series. An effective data representation manner, which can fuse such complex information and enable cognitive manufacturing decision-making from a global perspective, is necessary and challenging. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive manufacturing and applies it in a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) scenario. Based on the digital thread of manufacturing process data, a multi-layer manufacturing knowledge graph is established, including device sensing data, production processing data, and business processing data. With the established knowledge graph, a cognition-driven approach is proposed with a perception-cognition dual system, which achieves perception analysis and cognition decision-making in the resource allocation of the manufacturing process. Finally, responding to the orders of personalized products in a workshop is taken as an illustrative example. The performance of allocating resources of workshop devices under dynamic demand changes shows the advantages of the proposed approach. The proposed manner will lay the foundation for a human-like cognition for processing massive real-time industrial information in CPPS, thus paving a pathway towards the era of cognitive manufacturing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Cognitive manufacturing; Cyber-Physical Production System; Data fusion; Industrial Internet of Things; Knowledge graph,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2022,Journal,Liu M.; Li X.; Li J.; Liu Y.; Zhou B.; Bao J.,10.1016/j.aei.2021.101515
On the Selection of Ergonomics Evaluation Methods for Human Centric Manufacturing Tasks,"The last years several methods and sensors have emerged for the assessment of the physical and cognitive loads that human workers experience during the execution of manufacturing tasks. Questionnaires, videos, simulation data, IMU sensors, etc. are some of the data collection methods that can provide important data for the physical (skeleton joint angles, perceived fatigue, covered distance, and so forth), as well as for the cognitive (e.g., perceived user experience, eye movement, latency of movement) workload evaluation. However, there is no commonly accepted method to guide the practitioners in selecting the appropriate method and means to evaluate their task of interest. This paper goes a step further from the existing formal guidelines by considering aspects such as the stage of development of the manufacturing tasks and weighting the cognitive and physical aspects as per the task's nature. The proposed multi-criteria decision making method will map the custom requirements of each case in terms of cost, time, expertise, and available technology to the ones that each data collection method can meet in order to suggest an appropriate method. The proposed approach is applied in a case study coming from the bus and coach sector, where a mixed task (cognitive and physical effort) is assessed using video recordings and interviews. © 2022 The Authors.

Assessing needs for cognitive assistance with a cognitive constraints approach,"Smart manufacturing allows for greater job autonomy and distributed decision-making. This job enrichment poses in turn higher demands on the industrial workforce. In this context, cognitive assistance systems are seen as a means to support human information processing and decision-making. However, the understanding of cognitive processes and actual needs is still somewhat vague. What is needed is a deeper understanding of the nature and scope of needs, to properly identify cases for assistance and select and design appropriate tools. Building on the concept of constraints as applied in Cognitive Work Analysis, we elaborate on this perspective by firstly proposing a general model of human cognition centered around the concept of constraints. A series of qualitative interviews with employees in various sectors is then conducted to test the approach. The results demonstrate that a participative method focusing on needs for assistance can yield relevant results. Based upon the experiences from the study, a taxonomy of assistance for cognitive work is finally proposed. This taxonomy can be embedded in facilitated workshops in order to satisfy identified needs. © 2022 The Authors.

Robotic manufacturing systems: A survey on technologies to improve the cognitive level in HRI,"Human-robot interaction (HRI) plays an increasingly important role in modern manufacturing processes, as it greatly improves manufacturing efficiency, flexibility, and intelligence. However, some problems related to the cognitive level during the human interaction process still exist, which may hinder the manufacturing accuracy and efficiency, and even present a potential threat to humans who work in the same workspace. Therefore, this study conducts an in-depth survey on current non-exhaustive cognitive technologies such as sensing, motion planning, artificial intelligence, and human-inspired technologies, which are the key aspects for improving the cognitive level of robotic manufacturing systems in HRI. In addition, considering the limitations of current cognitive technologies, the authors present a multidisciplinary cognitive framework to improve the cognitive level of robotic manufacturing systems for intelligent HRI. © 2022 The Authors.

Extending the Ecological Interface Design process—Integrated EID,"This article aims to extend the traditional Ecological Interface Design (EID) process. With the rapid pace of digitalization in technological systems, there is a need for a design process that can handle the systemic design goals and the experiential basis of interaction. Currently, the traditional EID is well-positioned to address these challenges. However, methodologically, it needs to be substantiated to make it accessible for designers, designing for novel arenas, such as Industry 4.0. Further, substantiating the design process will help designers, engineers, and human factors researchers with an accessible pathway that links the design brief to the final interface form. Therefore, this article delves into the “design” basis in the work of the Risø group and other prominent EID researchers and practitioners. In addition, it draws from a variety of themes in the discipline of design that addresses methodology. In particular, key insights are drawn from the design methods movement (1960s—); design, communication, and complexity from the Ulm school of design, 1953–1968; cognitive research conducted on designers and design activities; and finally, interaction design and communication design processes and models. All of these insights have been used syncretically to create the new integrated EID (iEID) process. This new design process consists of nine stages divided into three phases of divergence, transformation, and convergence, converting the initial design brief to the final interface. The steps of iEID are demonstrated using the example of interface design for a “digital twin” in the manufacturing sector. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",design framework; design methodology; design process; Ecological Interface Design; interaction design,Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing,2022,Journal,Kant V.; Sudakaran J.S.,10.1002/hfm.20933
Adapting Cobot Behavior to Human Task Ordering Variability for Assembly Tasks,"In this paper, we address flexible assembly plans generation to accommodate human task variability. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed approach is based on a free-style human-robot interaction (HRI) that does not impose any task order on the participants and furthermore can accommodate their errors and help them to correct the errors without stopping the whole assembly process. Our approach is implemented in a real robotic architecture that combines sensory-motor modules with Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN) to endow the cobot with the necessary adaptability to correspond to human actions dynamically. We show experimentally with 56 participants on a simulated industrial assembly task that the cobot increases the task performance (reduction in the number of errors and gestures) without increasing the participants’ cognitive load. © 2022 by the authors.

Modern Cause and Effect Model by Factors of Root Cause for Accident Prevention in Small to Medium Sized Enterprises,"Background: Factors related to root causes can cause commonly occurring accidents such as falls, slips, and jammed injuries. An important means of reducing the frequency of occupational accidents in small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMSEs) of South Korea is to perform intensity analysis of the root cause factors for accident prevention in the cause and effect model like decision models, epidemiological models, system models, human factors models, LCU (life change unit) models, and the domino theory. Especially intensity analysis in a robot system and smart technology as Industry 4.0 is very important in order to minimize the occupational accidents and fatal accident because of the complexity of accident factors. Methods: We have developed the modern cause and effect model that includes factors of root cause through statistical testing to minimize commonly occurring accidents and fatal accidents in SMSEs of South Korea and systematically proposed educational policies for accident prevention. Results: As a result, the consciousness factors among factors of root cause such as unconsciousness, disregard, ignorance, recklessness, and misjudgment had strong relationships with occupational accidents in South Korean SMSEs. Conclusion: We conclude that the educational policies necessary for minimizing these consciousness factors include continuous training procedures followed by periodic hands-on experience, along with perceptual and cognitive education related to occupational health and safety. © 2021",Cause and effect model; Commonly occurring accidents; Consciousness factors; Educational policies; Intensity analysis; Perceptual and cognitive education; Root causes,Safety and Health at Work,2021,Journal,Kang Y.; Yang S.; Patterson P.,10.1016/j.shaw.2021.08.002
Situated Visualization of IIoT Data on the Hololens 2,"Augmented Reality for the Industrial Internet of Things (AIIT) is a use case in the larger research project Immersive Media Lab [2], which is currently being conducted at the University of Applied Sciences St.Pölten. This use case deals with the challenges of AR data visualization on AR HMDs in smart factories using the example of an industrial furnace. The application is intended to support people in two ways: On the one hand, new personnel should be able to quickly and easily understand the processes happening in the plant, and on the other hand, conditions for maintenance work that are invisible from the outside should be displayed in an understandable and easily consumable way directly situated at the system using AR. In addition to conventional displays (dashboards) for the representation of abstract sensor values, we use the concept of Indexical Visualization, which can reduce the cognitive load for the viewer. The system itself is expanded in AR in such a way that the information to be displayed becomes a natural part of the scene. In this paper, we describe the steps necessary to create a mixed reality industrial application for the Microsoft Hololens 2 in terms of: optimizing a digital 3D model of the facility, establishing the data interface to the plant using an OPC-UA to MQTT bridge, correctly aligning the large 3D object in the real environment, and visual metaphors for making the machine data understandable for users. © 2022 IEEE.",Human-centered computing; Human-centered computing; Human-computer interaction (HCI); Information visualization; Interaction paradigms; Mixed/augmented reality; Visualization; Visualization application domains,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops, VRW 2022",2022,Conference,Husinsky M.; Schlager A.; Jalaeefar A.; Klimpfinger S.; Schumach M.,10.1109/VRW55335.2022.00104
Cognitive Human Factors in the Artificial Intelligence of Things,"Internet of Things (IoT) systems are increasingly becoming complex. Heterogeneity in terms of hardware, software, computing capacity and connectivity is a source of complexity. The conversion of IoT systems into cyber-physical systems, including devices that are able not only to collect but also to process and take decisions, in real-time is a second source of complexity. Moreover, not only sensors should be considered, but also actuators, especially robots in the industry domain. In this context Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies provide powerful capabilities to endow IoT devices with intelligent services, leading to the so-called Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). In this context, the operator/user is in the middle of this complexity trying to understand the current situation and make effective real-time decisions. Hence, human factors, especially the cognitive ones, is a major issue to be addressed. New software development methods in the form of assistants and wizards are necessary to help operators/users to be context-aware and reduce their technical workload about coding or computer-oriented skills, focusing on the task/service at hands.  © 2022 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; human factors; internet of things,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, SCC 2022",2022,Conference,Cecilio A.,10.1109/SCC55611.2022.00058
A Dynamic Model of Evolutionary Knowledge and Capabilities Based on Human-Machine Interaction in Smart Manufactures,"The increasing use of smart machines and devices is not only changing production principles but also reshaping the value of cocreation logic. The interaction between human and smart machine is the enabler of generating augmented intelligence. A system dynamics model is abstracted from smart manufacturing practices to represent the evolutionary processes of inertia, capability, and reliability induced by human-machine interaction. Human-machine interaction is conceptualized into two dimensions: technical and cognitive interaction. Simulation experiments illustrate how the improvement of human-machine interaction can leverage the dynamic capability and reduce the inertia in enterprises through multiple nonlinear feedbacks. There are two pathways to improve reliability and performance in enterprises by human-machine interaction: (1) to promote initiative innovation (change) from endogenous enabler by improving dynamic capability and (2) to promote transformation of knowledge and variation triggered by exogenous environmental changes to improve the dynamic capability for the flexibility and reliability. © 2022 Shuxian Chen et al.",,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2022,Journal,Chen S.; Ren Z.; Yu X.; Huang A.,10.1155/2022/8584888
The rising issue of user manual accessibility: Implications for the safe operation of Elevated Work Platforms (EWPs),"Elevated Work Platforms (EWP) have been implemented as a measure to prevent falls. However, fatalities and injuries relating to EWP use are of concern within the construction industry, with crushing risks often a significant factor in operator fatalities. With a greater number of workers using these machines internationally, it is imperative to develop policies and strategies to guarantee the safe use of EWPs. One key issue is that EWP familiarisation has been primarily centred on the user manual. However, it is unclear if user manuals are an adequate source of education and training in terms of content and readability. To address this research gap, a content analysis was used to assess the differences in content and readability among the manuals of the most used EWPs in Australia. The qualitative findings showed that there are nine safety-related themes in the user manuals, such as control warnings and in-basket safety. The quantitative analysis found that some manuals require several years of education above that recommended for a universal audience (>8 years) to be understood. This finding calls for better training and education across the range of EWP control layouts and standardisation across the methods by which the manuals convey control information to reduce the cognitive load placed on operators to remember and accurately utilise the controls of the wide variety of existing EWPs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Construction; Education; Heavy machinery; Human factors; User manuals,Safety Science,2021,Journal,Briant O.; Tichon J.; Diver P.; Oviedo-Trespalacios O.,10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105444
A Cognitive Digital Twins Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration,"This paper proposes a cognitive digital twin framework for smart manufacturing, and especially for human-robot-collaboration cases. The proposed framework comprises three layers (field, edge, and cloud layers) based on the 5G communication network. In the field layer, the physical twin's data from the physical machine and human operators are transmitted through the edge layer and then to the cloud layer to virtualize the digital twin. The cloud layer generates inference model generation by deep learning training and updates the inference model in the edge layer to make the field's machine smart. Especially, human operators' models are built based on the multimodal fusion in the cloud layer for cognitive function. Also, edge-cloud collaborative computing is presented to implement the proposed framework. Finally, the study is validated with a human-robot-collaboration case involving 5G edge computing. © 2022 The Authors.

Adaptive Cognitive Manufacturing System (ACMS)–a new paradigm,"Innovation and transformative changes in products, manufacturing technologies, business strategies, and manufacturing paradigms have profoundly changed the manufacturing systems. In addition to being environmentally, economically socially sustainable, manufacturing systems are increasingly using intelligent technologies to be even more resilient, responsive, and adaptable. A new Adaptive Cognitive Manufacturing Systems (ACMS) paradigm, its drivers, enablers, and characteristics, including cognitive adaptation, is presented. Classification and definitions of four types of adaptability in manufacturing systems are included. Human-centric collaboration of workers and intelligent machines and applications, and the future of work in cognitive adaptive manufacturing systems are outlined. Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT), their features, evolution, and their use to support humans in intelligent, collaborative manufacturing settings are discussed. Industrial applications and case studies are used to illustrate the presented concepts and paradigms. Challenges and future research directions to achieve the ACMS paradigm and implement more intelligent, more adaptive, and sustainable manufacturing systems are presented. The presented novel concepts and technologies make significant contributions to the fast-evolving field of manufacturing systems.

Reliability-Based Aggregation of Heterogeneous Knowledge to Assist Operators in Manufacturing,"In socio-technical systems, such as manufacturing processes, human operators are often entrusted with cognitive tasks that rely on tacit knowledge. Extracting the operators' tacit knowledge is beneficial to facilitate knowledge transfer and enable semantic machine learning. We improve upon an existing methodology that relies on operators' insights into influences on their decision making processes to extract tacit knowledge. By introducing a data-based weighting of the operators' information, we are able to control varying degrees of worker reliability and other individual biases, increasing the quality of the aggregated knowledge. We evaluate several methods to weigh and aggregate knowledge on a real-world dataset collected in the domain of fused deposition modelling (FDM) showing an improvement of 34% over a previously published baseline applied to our data. Applicability of the approach in the same domain is demonstrated by a case study, where the aggregated knowledge is utilised to shorten the time required for parametrisation.  © 2022 IEEE.",collaborative knowledge capturing; knowledge aggregation; knowledge extraction,"Proceedings - 16th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, ICSC 2022",2022,Conference,Nordsieck R.; Heider M.; Hoffmann A.; Hahner J.,10.1109/ICSC52841.2022.00027
Dynamic Scene Graph for Mutual-Cognition Generation in Proactive Human-Robot Collaboration,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) plays a crucial role in agile, flexible, and human-centric manufacturing towards the mass personalization transition. Nevertheless, in today's HRC tasks, either humans or robots need to follow the partners' commands and instructions along collaborative activities progressing, instead of proactive, mutual engagement. The non-semantic perception of HRC scenarios impedes mutually needed, proactive planning and high-cognitive capabilities in existing HRC systems. To overcome the bottleneck, this research explores a dynamic scene graph-based method for mutual-cognition generation in Proactive HRC applications. Firstly, a spatial-attention object detector is utilized to dynamically perceive objects in industrial settings. Secondly, a linking prediction module is leveraged to construct HRC scene graphs. An attentional graph convolutional network (GCN) is utilized to capture relations between industrial parts, human operators, and robot operations and reason structural connections of human-robot collaborative processing as graph embedding, which links to mutual planners for human operation supports and robot proactive instructions. Lastly, the Proactive HRC implementation is demonstrated on disassembly tasks of aging electronic vehicle batteries (EVBs) and evaluate its mutual-cognition capabilities. © 2022 The Authors.

Analysis of accidents through combination of CAST and TRACEr techniques: A case study,"This article presents a methodology for accident analysis developed from the combination of CAST - Causal Analysis based on System Theory, derived from the STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Process) accident causation model and the human error analysis/investigation tool TRACEr (Technique for the Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors). This combination was proposed from the perceived need to structure one of the stages of the application of the CAST technique where unsafe control actions, or human errors, that occurred in the course of accidental events are analyzed, for which the application of the TRACEr technique proved extremely useful. From the application of the proposed combination to an accident that occurred in an oil production unit in operation on the coast of southeastern Brazil, it was possible to obtain a deeper understanding of the psychological phenomena that preceded one of the unsafe control actions, as well as the identification of performance shaping factors that contributed to its occurrence. These results demonstrated the conceptual cohesion and mutual complementarity of the associated techniques, which allowed a comprehensive understanding of the accidental event and, consequently, the elaboration of safety recommendations more appropriate to the findings of the analysis, better specified to the aspects of human factors involved. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Accident analysis; Human error; Oil and gas industry; System theoretic accident model and process; Technique for the retrospective and predictive analysis of cognitive errors,Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries,2022,Journal,Fagundes J.M.; Gaya de Figueiredo M.A.; Alberton A.L.; Antonio Luquetti dos Santos I.J.,10.1016/j.jlp.2021.104639
DOLCE: A descriptive ontology for linguistic and cognitive engineering,"dolce, the first top-level (foundational) ontology to be axiomatized, has remained stable for twenty years and today is broadly used in a variety of domains. dolce is inspired by cognitive and linguistic considerations and aims to model a commonsense view of reality, like the one human beings exploit in everyday life in areas as diverse as socio-technical systems, manufacturing, financial transactions and cultural heritage. dolce clearly lists the ontological choices it is based upon, relies on philosophical principles, is richly formalized, and is built according to well-established ontological methodologies, e.g. OntoClean. Because of these features, it has inspired most of the existing top-level ontologies and has been used to develop or improve standards and public domain resources (e.g. CIDOC CRM, DBpedia and WordNet). Being a foundational ontology, dolce is not directly concerned with domain knowledge. Its purpose is to provide the general categories and relations needed to give a coherent view of reality, to integrate domain knowledge, and to mediate across domains. In these 20 years dolce has shown that applied ontologies can be stable and that interoperability across reference and domain ontologies is a reality.

ODIN architecture enabling reconfigurable human - robot based production lines,"Over the last decades, a significant effort has been allocated by the research community towards improving robot capabilities. These emerged robot cognitive and perception abilities have been driving the swift of production paradigm from rigid automation systems to hybrid and collaborative working environments. Nevertheless, the adoption of robots in lower volume, diverse manufacturing environments is still constrained, due to a) the high integration and deployment complexity of end-to-end integrated robotic applications, b) the limited flexibility of existing solutions in dealing with unexpected events in a dynamic way. This paper presents a modular service-oriented architecture for robotic resources that aims to address those limitations by a) creating digital models, semantically characterizing all production entities and processes in a unified way, b) deploy open interfaces allowing the communication of all robotics hardware and control systems, c) dynamically plan and orchestrate manufacturing operations execution by the involved human and robot resources, and d) collectively share the resources' perceived environment. The overall system includes the integration of task planning, perception, actuation, and robot control modules while Augmented Reality (AR) based interfaces has been considered for including human operators in the loop. The described architecture has been tested and validated in a case study inspired from the automotive industry. © 2022 The Authors.

Actuator Fluid Control Using Fuzzy Feedback for Soft Robotics Activities,"Soft robotics is a new field that uses actuators that are non-standard and compatible materials. Industrial robotics is high-throughput manufacturing devices that are quick and accurate. They are built on rigid-body mechanisms. The advancement of robotic production now depends on the inclusion of staff in manufacturing processes, allowing for the completion of activities that need cognitive abilities that are now beyond the scope of artificial networks. Hydrostatic pressure is used to achieve high deflections of structures that are based on the elastomeric in Fluid Actuators (FAs). Soft actuators based on the fluid are a popular choice safe for humans and lightweight robots. However, owing to a deficiency of durable, accurate, and affordable sensors that can be combined with actuator systems that are highly deformable and that use low-cost materials and production, closed-loop management of such actuators remains difficult. Such actuators, in combination with hydrodynamic force feedback, form a series-elastic actuation (SEA), which eliminates virtually friction from all driving-point. Fuzzy control is a smart computing analysis technique that enables complex systems to be controlled independently of a mathematical model. Fuzzy logic is used to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC’s) function to find the best rational controller for an automated robot. Because discontinuous endpoint friction is undetectable to the pressure of the fluid internally, feedback from traditional external force using force/tactile sensing is preferred. As a result, a fuzzy-based control using linear feedback was developed and used to test the integrated system’s response dynamically and location accuracy. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

Towards proactive human–robot collaboration: A foreseeable cognitive manufacturing paradigm,"Human–robot collaboration (HRC) has attracted strong interests from researchers and engineers for improved operational flexibility and efficiency towards mass personalization. Nevertheless, existing HRC development mainly undertakes either human-centered or robot-centered manner reactively, where operations are conducted by following the pre-defined instructions, thus far from an efficient integration of robotic automation and human cognitions. The prevailing research on human-level information processing of cognitive computing, the industrial IoT, and robot learning creates the possibility of bridging the gap of knowledge distilling and information sharing between onsite operators, robots and other manufacturing systems. Hence, a foreseeable informatics-based cognitive manufacturing paradigm, Proactive HRC, is introduced as an advanced form of Symbiotic HRC with high-level cognitive teamwork skills to be achieved stepwise, including: (1) inter-collaboration cognition, establishing bi-directional empathy in the execution loop based on a holistic understanding of humans and robots’ situations; (2) spatio-temporal cooperation prediction, estimating human–robot–object interaction of hierarchical sub-tasks/activities over time for the proactive planning; and (3) self-organizing teamwork, converging knowledge of distributed HRC systems for self-organization learning and task allocation. Except for the description of their technical cores, the main challenges and potential opportunities are further discussed to enable the readiness towards Proactive HRC. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Cognitive manufacturing; Human–robot collaboration; Industrial Internet-of-Things; Mass personalization; Smart manufacturing,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2021,Journal,Li S.; Wang R.; Zheng P.; Wang L.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.07.017
Ajalon: Simplifying the authoring of wearable cognitive assistants,"Wearable Cognitive Assistance (WCA) amplifies human cognition in real time through a wearable device and low-latency wireless access to edge computing infrastructure. It is inspired by, and broadens, the metaphor of GPS navigation tools that provide real-time step-by-step guidance, with prompt error detection and correction. WCA applications are likely to be transformative in education, health care, industrial troubleshooting, manufacturing, assisted driving, and sports training. Today, WCA application development is difficult and slow, requiring skills in areas such as machine learning and computer vision that are not widespread among software developers. This paper describes Ajalon, an authoring toolchain for WCA applications that reduces the skill and effort needed at each step of the development pipeline.

Modeling of Human Cognition in Consensus Agreement on Social Media and Its Implications for Smarter Manufacturing,"Opinion dynamics modeling has long been interesting to scientists because of its applications in the marketing industry as well as elections. Agreement, e.g., on a special product, has an affective influence on its manufacturing process. However, most of the existing opinion dynamics models are linear time invariant. In this article, eight non-linear time variant models for opinion dynamics are proposed and put to test on subjective synthetic networks. Despite all the efforts, the issues of stability and convergence in time-varying networks, which can be found in industrial contexts, have not been resolved yet and only sufficient conditions have been derived. In the proposed models, unlike in the classical ones such as the French-DeGroot model, we have taken into account each member's susceptibility to persuasion by others that is a cognitive parametric function of individuals' opinions. In addition, we have introduced a stubbornness matrix which has large values initially but shrinks to zero as the time grows. This implies that agents' susceptibilities to others, at the beginning of any experiment, are smaller than what they are at the end. We present a novel mathematical formulation for these new opinion dynamics models and prove their stability too. For evaluation, we simulated a scenario in which some people connected via a graph, voted for a product. They initially had their own stands but gradually came to a point found through interaction with the others. The results confirm the convergence and stability of the proposed models.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Convergence; human cognition; industrial manufacturing; marketing industry; opinion dynamics; social networks,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2021,Journal,Nematollahzadeh S.M.; Ozgoli S.; Jolfaei A.; Haghighi M.S.,10.1109/TII.2020.2989729
Overloaded and at Work: Investigating the Effect of Cognitive Workload on Assembly Task Performance,"Objective: This study investigates the effect of cognitive overload on assembly task performance and muscle activity. Background: Understanding an operator’s cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human–machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. Method: Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. Results: Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by the n-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times. Application: Results are applicable to the assessment of the effects of high cognitive workload in manufacturing. © Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",assembly task; cognitive ergonomics; cognitive workload; multitasking; muscle activity,Human Factors,2021,Journal,Biondi F.N.; Cacanindin A.; Douglas C.; Cort J.,10.1177/0018720820929928
The Impact of New Technologies on Work Design - Case Study of the Industrial Robot Controllers from One Organization,"Work design theory research has a long and rich tradition in the industrial and organisational psychology. Work design identifies tasks, activities, relationships, and responsibilities in a specific job. It provides a comprehensive job description useful for examining and creating optimal working conditions, also by developing empowering workers or by restructuring their responsibilities. Human-robot interaction is among the domains with a high demand for work design. It is related to the widespread human fear of being replaced by machines at work, as well as the still small number of publications in this field, mostly devoted to human-robot interaction analysis conditions. Scholars have identified an elaborated set of tasks by a human during working with a robot. From work design perspective, besides expanding what tasks are considered, it is crucial to consider its meaning for creating critical psychological states, which are important for individual and organisational results. Thus, the paper preparation's impetus describes and analyses the tasks carried out by robot operators in a more precise manner, by using psychological work analysis from the work design perspective. The research group consists of 32 robot operators from a large international manufacturing company. The Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) was used to describe 21 of work characteristics. Results show that Task Variety, Information Processing, Task Identity, Specialisation, Skill Variety, Problem-solving, Task Significance, Received Interdependence, Feedback From Others, and Feedback from Job are the highest work characteristics of robot operators. It suggests that robot operators distinguish non-routine, cognitive, and interpersonal tasks as more substantial than other tasks. Alike, according to the work design theory, the work characteristics indicated by respondents are recognised as important job-specific factors for workers' critical psychological states i.e., experiencing meaning, feeling responsible for outcomes, and understanding the results of their efforts, and helping shape the context of the work. It is imperative that further and more extensive research is conducted to bring more attention to how work design can support individuals' cognitive, social, and identity development in human-robot interaction.  © 2021 IEEE.",human-robot interaction; task-based approach; work characteristics; Work Design,"Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management, CogSIMA 2021",2021,Conference,Pollak A.; Paliga M.; Kozusznik B.,10.1109/CogSIMA51574.2021.9475924
"Scared, frustrated and quietly proud: Testers' lived experience of tools and automation","Software testing is vital, expensive, time-consuming yet a necessary part of software development. Testers perform repeated actions during testing, where automation and tools could reduce costs, timescale and human error. However, challenges to tools adoption have been identified in academic research and industry, which are blockers to success with automation. In attempting to find whether testers were experiencing tool usability shortcomings, we followed an exploratory research path, collecting stories from over 100 test practitioners. We discovered a richer, more complex story than we expected. We realised that usability-while necessary-is not sufficient to enable success, and that other human factors challenge successful automation projects. In answering privately to questions about their experiences of tools and automation, testers expressed themselves in language that was more emotional and linked to their lived experience (LX) than we expected. We uncovered frustrations and fear, as well as pride. In this paper we present our findings so far about TX: The testers' lived experience of tools and automation, and we suggest steps for future research. © 2021 ACM.",human factors; lived experience; software testing; test automation; test tools; usability; user experience,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021,Conference,Evans I.; Porter C.; Micallef M.,10.1145/3452853.3452872
A cognitive perspective on counterproductive work behavior. Evidence from a two-wave longitudinal study,"Counterproductive work behavior (CWB) is costly for organizations and their members. In this study, we adopted the theory of planned behavior and the effort-reward imbalance model to understand how behavioral intention relates to actual CWB, how such a relationship arises from personal beliefs and social norms, and whether perceptions of imbalance between efforts and rewards contribute to explain CWB. Two-wave data with a time lag of 12 weeks were collected among 80 Italian employees working in a large production plant of a private company operating in the manufacturing sector in Italy. Self-reported measures of attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions and CWB, perceived efforts and rewards, as well as control variables were collected. Attitudes and perceived behavioral control were indirectly related to CWB via behavioral intention. Effort-reward imbalance was not related to CWB. Our findings suggest that attitudinally controlled intentions, which have an internal locus of causality, are associated with greater likelihood of CWB performance, and that individual perceptions of control over CWB are key predictors of such a negative, volitional organizational behavior. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Counterproductive work behavior; Effort-reward imbalance model; Human resource management; Theory of planned behavior,Current Psychology,2021,Journal,Costantini A.; Ceschi A.; Sartori R.,10.1007/s12144-019-00416-5
Cognitive Load Analyzer: A Support Tool for Cognitive-Driven Development,"Software modularity refers to the decomposition of complex software to be manageable for the purpose of implementation and maintenance. Most methodologies and practices adopted in the industry follow this principle, often with the benefit of flexibility and variety in use. This is also a recognition that human work can be improved by focus on a limited set of data. However, code more complex than needed continues being produced resulting in cognitive overload for developers. Cognitive-Driven Development (CDD) is an inspiration from the Cognitive Load Theory for software development with the goal of reducing the split-attention effect and the problem space through a feasible cognitive complexity constraint. Implementation units can be kept under this limit even with the continuous expansion of software scale. Experimental studies were carried out and their results suggested that CDD is a promising method when guiding the development focusing on understanding and achieving high-quality code with respect to the quality metrics. In this paper, we present a tool called ""Cognitive Load Analyzer""to support the CDD, a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and Java language. This tool can be useful to support the adoption of the CDD aiming to overcome the to slice the code and help developers to reduce code complexity. © 2021 ACM.",Cognitive load analyzer; Cognitive-driven development; Software complexity,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021,Conference,Pereira J.H.A.; Souza A.L.O.T.D.; Pinto V.H.S.C.,10.1145/3474624.3476011
"Effect of Cognitive Fatigue, Operator Sex, and Robot Assistance on Task Performance Metrics, Workload, and Situation Awareness in Human-Robot Collaboration","Advancements in robot technology are allowing for increasing integration of humans and robots in shared space manufacturing processes. While individual task performance of the robotic assistance and human operator can be separately optimized, the interaction between humans and robots can lead to emergent effects on collaborative performance. Thus, the performance benefits of increased automation in robotic assistance and its impact by human factors need to be considered. As such, this letter examines the interplay of operator sex, their cognitive fatigue states, and varying levels of automation on collaborative task performance, operator situation awareness and perceived workload, and physiological responses (heart rate variability; HRV). Sixteen participants, balanced by sex, performed metal polishing tasks directly with a UR10 collaborative robot under different fatigued states and with varying levels of robotic assistance. Perceived fatigue, situation awareness, and workload were measured periodically, in addition to continuous physiological monitoring and three task performance metrics: task efficiency, accuracy, and precision, were obtained. Higher robotic assistance demonstrated direct task performance benefits. However, unlike females, males did not perceive the performance benefits as better with higher automation. A relationship between situation awareness and automation was observed in both the HRV signals and subjective measures, where increased robot assistance reduced the attentional supply and task engagement of participants. The consideration of the interplay between human factors, such as operator sex and their cognitive states, and robot factors on collaborative performance can lead to improved human-robot collaborative system designs.  © 2016 IEEE.",Autonomous agents; ECG; human factors and human-in-the-loop; human-robot collaboration; industrial robots; manufacturing; sex differences; surface finishing,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2021,Journal,Hopko S.K.; Khurana R.; Mehta R.K.; Pagilla P.R.,10.1109/LRA.2021.3062787
"Artificial Intelligence (AI): Multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy","As far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had reached the limits of physical capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range of industrial, intellectual and social applications. The pace of change for this new AI technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making, engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. The impact of AI could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all potentially disrupted by the onset of AI technologies. The study brings together the collective insight from a number of leading expert contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by the rapid emergence of AI within a number of domains: business and management, government, public sector, and science and technology.

Exploring augmented reality for worker assistance versus training,"This paper aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of the affordances of Augmented Reality (AR) as a workplace-based learning and training technology in supporting manual or semi-automated manufacturing tasks that involve both complex manipulation and reasoning. Between-subject laboratory experiments involving 20 participants are conducted on a real-life electro-mechanical assembly task to investigate the impacts of various modes of information delivery through AR compared to traditional training methods on task efficiency, number of errors, learning, independence, and cognitive load. The AR application is developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed. Several insights drawn from the experiments and expert interviews are discussed to inform the design of future AR technologies for both training and assisting incumbent and future manufacturing workers on complex manipulation and reasoning tasks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Augmented reality; Electro-mechanical assembly; Workforce training; Workplace-based learning,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2021,Journal,Moghaddam M.; Wilson N.C.; Modestino A.S.; Jona K.; Marsella S.C.,10.1016/j.aei.2021.101410
Exploring skill requirements for the industry 4.0: A worker-oriented approach; [Explorando habilidades requeridas para la industria 4.0: un enfoque orientado al trabajador],"Emerging technologies are shaping the world of work, thus creating an increasingly digital industry, also known as “Industry 4.0”. Thus, examining skill requirements becomes essential to facilitate organizational adaptation to this technological revolution. The aim of this study was to explore the perception of skill requirements of workers of a highly technological manufacturing company. In Study 1 (n = 671), an exploratory factor analysis was carried out to identify relevant groups of skills. A year later, in Study 2 (n = 176), we confirmed the factor structure through a confirmatory factor analysis and we conducted a latent growth curve analysis to examine potential changes of the previous skill requirements due to the lockdown and the forced remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings showed that cognitive, functional business, strategic and managing people skills are considered as important resources for the industry 4.0, being the functional business skills increasingly relevant in time 2. Moreover, we identified differences between managers and subordinates regarding such skills. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for skills development in the digital age. © 2021: Editum.

Neurobehavioral assessment of force feedback simulation in industrial robotic teleoperation,"Telerobotic operation, i.e., a human operator to manipulate remote robotic systems at a distance, has started to gain its popularity in the construction industry. It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye-tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages. © 2021",fNIRS; Force feedback; Human-robot collaboration; Neurophysiological analysis; Teleoperation; Virtual reality,Automation in Construction,2021,Journal,Zhu Q.; Du J.; Shi Y.; Wei P.,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103674
Corrective Shared Autonomy for Addressing Task Variability,"Many tasks, particularly those involving interaction with the environment, are characterized by high variability, making robotic autonomy difficult. One flexible solution is to introduce the input of a human with superior experience and cognitive abilities as part of a shared autonomy policy. However, current methods for shared autonomy are not designed to address the wide range of necessary corrections (e.g., positions, forces, execution rate, etc.) that the user may need to provide to address task variability. In this letter, we present corrective shared autonomy, where users provide corrections to key robot state variables on top of an otherwise autonomous task model. We provide an instantiation of this shared autonomy paradigm and demonstrate its viability and benefits such as low user effort and physical demand via a system-level user study on three tasks involving variability situated in aircraft manufacturing.  © 2016 IEEE.",Human-robot collaboration; telerobotics and teleoperation,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2021,Journal,Hagenow M.; Senft E.; Radwin R.; Gleicher M.; Mutlu B.; Zinn M.,10.1109/LRA.2021.3064500
Towards semantic integration of machine vision systems to aid manufacturing event understanding,"A manufacturing paradigm shift from conventional control pyramids to decentralized, service-oriented, and cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is taking place in today’s 4th industrial revolution. Generally accepted roles and implementation recipes of cyber systems are expected to be standardized in the future of manufacturing industry. The authors intend to develop a novel CPS-enabled control architecture that accommodates: (1) intelligent information systems involving domain knowledge, empirical model, and simulation; (2) fast and secured industrial communication networks; (3) cognitive automation by rapid signal analytics and machine learning (ML) based feature extraction; (4) interoperability between machine and human. Semantic integration of process indicators is fundamental to the success of such implementation. This work proposes an automated semantic integration of data-intensive process signals that is deployable to industrial signal-based control loops. The proposed system rapidly infers manufacturing events from image-based data feeds, and hence triggers process control signals. Two image inference approaches are implemented: cloud-based ML model query and edge-end object shape detection. Depending on use cases and task requirements, these two approaches can be designated with different event detection tasks to provide a comprehensive system self-awareness. Coupled with conventional industrial sensor signals, machine vision system can rapidly understand manufacturing scenes, and feed extracted semantic information to a manufacturing ontology developed by either expert or ML-enabled cyber systems. Moreover, extracted signals are interpreted by Programmable Logical Controllers (PLCs) and field devices for cognitive automation towards fully autonomous industrial systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Performance differences between instructions on paper vs digital glasses for a simple assembly task,"Objective: Providing instruction for assembly tasks is essential in modern manufacturing industry, as well as in households for customers that buy products to be assembled at home. Recent technological developments might be able to assist in completing an assembly task faster and more accurately. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether performance and usability differs when instructions for an assembly task are presented on digital glasses versus paper. Methods: Participants (n = 63) completed one of three versions of an assembly task (between-subject-design) with LEGO® bricks: (1) with paper instruction (P), (2) with text instructions presented stepwise via digital glasses (GT), (3) with stepwise text and auditory instruction (in parallel) on digital glasses (GA). Outcome measures on performance were completion time and errors. Furthermore, usability was measured by the User Experience Questionnaire, the Standardized Usability Questionnaire, the Post-Study Usability Questionnaire, and cognitive processing skills were assessed by the Trail Making Test and different versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. Analyses were adjusted for the confounding factors age, gender, experience with glasses and LEGO, and problems with instruction. Results: Findings indicate that task completion was faster with the paper instructions compared to both versions of instruction via digital glasses (GT, GA). We observed no difference in accuracy and usability between the instructions. “Novelty” was rated higher for instructions for both GT and GA, compared to P. Discussion: Results show that instructions on digital glasses may not always be more effective for assembly than the traditional paper-based instructions. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether effectiveness may depend on task complexity, target group, experience of the user with task and device, and how the information is presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Assembly experiment; Assembly task; Assistance; Assistance systems; Data glasses; Digital glasses; Google glasses; Head-mounted display; Instructions; LEGO®; Smart eyewear device; Smart glasses,Applied Ergonomics,2021,Journal,Rodriguez F.S.; Saleem K.; Spilski J.; Lachmann T.,10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103423
Facing with Collaborative Robots: The Subjective Experience in Senior and Younger Workers,"In the past few years, collaborative robots (i.e., cobots) have been largely adopted within industrial manufacturing. Although robots can support companies and workers in carrying out complex activities and improving productivity, human factors related to cobot operators have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The present study aims to understand the subjective experience of younger and senior workers interacting with an industrial collaborative robot. Results show that workers' acceptance of cobots is high, regardless of age and control modality used. Interesting differences between seniors and younger adults emerged in the evaluations of user experience, usability, and perceived workload of participants and are detailed and commented in the last part of the work. © Chiara Rossato et al. 2021; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2021.",acceptance; cognitive workload; collaborative robot; elderly workers; usability; user experience,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",2021,Journal,Rossato C.; Pluchino P.; Cellini N.; Jacucci G.; Spagnolli A.; Gamberini L.,10.1089/cyber.2020.0180
Industry 4.0 and corporate sustainability: An exploratory analysis of possible impacts in the Brazilian context,"This paper aims to analyse the impacts of Industry 4.0 on corporate sustainability, considering the Brazilian context. From a literature review, 12 impacts were identified and used to structure a questionnaire. This questionnaire was applied in a survey with experienced Brazilian researchers. The data was analysed using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, Descriptive Statistics and TOPSIS, which allowed for impact ordering. It was evidenced that all the presented impacts will be evident in the Brazilian context in a ten-year horizon. Of these impacts, six stand out: 1) the reduction of job offers for manual and repetitive activities and the emergence of new, high value-added professions; 2) the emergence of innovative business; 3) the reduction of work accidents due to the expanded use of robots in dangerous tasks for humans; 4) problems with the employees’ qualification pace in the required modernisation changes; 5) the integration of all value chain activities, allowing for a better analysis of environmental, social and economic impacts; and 6) improvements in physical and cognitive ergonomics due to the use of sensors. These findings can contribute to the expansion of the debates related to the theme and can be used as a base for defining future industrial policies in Brazil. © 2021",Exploratory study; Impacts; Industry 4.0; Sustainability,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021,Journal,Siltori P.F.S.; Anholon R.; Rampasso I.S.; Quelhas O.L.G.; Santa-Eulalia L.A.; Leal Filho W.,10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120741

A Blockchained Federated Learning Framework for Cognitive Computing in Industry 4.0 Networks,"Cognitive computing, a revolutionary AI concept emulating human brain's reasoning process, is progressively flourishing in the Industry 4.0 automation. With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of 'data island' with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections.

An end-to-end tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph for manufacturing documents,"Industrial tabular information extraction and its semantic fusion with text (ITIESF) is of great significance in converting and fusing industrial unstructured data into structured knowledge to guide cognitive intelligence analysis in the manufacturing industry. A novel end-to-end ITIESF approach is proposed to integrate tabular information and construct a tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph (TCEEKG). Specifically, an end-to-end joint learning strategy is presented to mine the semantic information in tables. The definition and modeling method of the intrinsic relationships between tables with their rows and columns in engineering documents are provided to model the tabular information. Due to this, an end-to-end joint entity relationship extraction method for textual and tabular information from engineering documents is proposed to construct text-based knowledge graphs (KG) and tabular information-based causality event evolutionary graphs (CEEG). Then, a novel NSGCN (neighborhoods sample graph convolution network)-based entity alignment is proposed to fuse the cross-knowledge graphs into a unified knowledge base. Furthermore, a translation-based graph structure-driven Q&A (question and answer) approach is designed to respond to cause analysis and problem tracing. Our models can be easily integrated into a prototype system to provide a joint information processing and cognitive analysis. Finally, the approach is evaluated by employing the aerospace machining documents to illustrate that the TCEEKG can considerably help workers strengthen their skills in the cause-and-effect analysis of machining quality issues from a global perspective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Causality analysis; Engineering document; Graph embedding; Knowledge graph; Table modeling,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2021,Journal,Zhou B.; Hua B.; Gu X.; Lu Y.; Peng T.; Zheng Y.; Shen X.; Bao J.,10.1016/j.aei.2021.101441
A fatigue-conscious dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem by enhanced NSGA-II: An application from casting workshop,"Dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem (DRCFJSP) becomes a hot research topic in recent years. However, worker fatigue is barely considered in DRCFJSP, which will result in unsuitable task assignments for workers and bring about negative effects such as muscle fatigue and cognitive confusion. To this end, a fatigue-conscious DRCFJSP is proposed in this paper, aiming at simultaneously relieving fatigue and promoting productivity by joint scheduling of machines and workers. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to minimize the maximum worker fatigue and makespan. Furthermore, an enhanced NSGA-II (ENSGA) is developed in this paper to cope with the proposed problem. In the ENSGA, four dispatch rules are designed to generate high-quality solutions at the initialization stage. Two neighborhood structures based on a novel method of defining the critical path are designed to strengthen the ability of local search. Finally, with the comprehensive experiments on extensive test instances and a case study from real-world casting workshop, the effectiveness of proposed ENSGA for solving the fatigue-conscious DRCFJSP is verified, and the significance of the proposed joint scheduling approach is elucidated. This work renders the decision-maker practical and effective scheduling with fatigue-conscious for the machine and worker constrained flexible manufacturing system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Casting workshop; Dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem; Initialization method; Multi-objective optimization; Neighborhood structure; Worker fatigue,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2021,Conference,Tan W.; Yuan X.; Wang J.; Zhang X.,10.1016/j.cie.2021.107557
A neural integrator model for planning and value-based decision making of a robotics assistant,"Modern manufacturing and assembly environments are characterized by a high variability in the built process which challenges human–robot cooperation. To reduce the cognitive workload of the operator, the robot should not only be able to learn from experience but also to plan and decide autonomously. Here, we present an approach based on Dynamic Neural Fields that apply brain-like computations to endow a robot with these cognitive functions. A neural integrator is used to model the gradual accumulation of sensory and other evidence as time-varying persistent activity of neural populations. The decision to act is modeled by a competitive dynamics between neural populations linked to different motor behaviors. They receive the persistent activation pattern of the integrators as input. In the first experiment, a robot learns rapidly by observation the sequential order of object transfers between an assistant and an operator to subsequently substitute the assistant in the joint task. The results show that the robot is able to proactively plan the series of handovers in the correct order. In the second experiment, a mobile robot searches at two different workbenches for a specific object to deliver it to an operator. The object may appear at the two locations in a certain time period with independent probabilities unknown to the robot. The trial-by-trial decision under uncertainty is biased by the accumulated evidence of past successes and choices. The choice behavior over a longer period reveals that the robot achieves a high search efficiency in stationary as well as dynamic environments. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Assembly robot; Dynamic Neural Field; Neural integrator; Sequence learning; Value-based decision making,Neural Computing and Applications,2021,Journal,Wojtak W.; Ferreira F.; Vicente P.; Louro L.; Bicho E.; Erlhagen W.,10.1007/s00521-020-05224-8
Towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network: An industrial knowledge graph-based multi-agent reinforcement learning approach,"Empowered by the advanced cognitive computing, industrial Internet-of-Things, and data analytics techniques, today's smart manufacturing systems are ever-increasingly equipped with cognitive capabilities, towards an emerging Self-X cognitive manufacturing network with higher level of automation. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the readiness of ‘Self-X’ levels (e.g., self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adjust/adaptive/healing) is still in the infant stage. To pave its way, this work stepwise introduces an industrial knowledge graph (IKG)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for achieving the Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. Firstly, an IKG should be formulated based on the extracted empirical knowledge and recognized patterns in the manufacturing process, by exploiting the massive human-generated and machine-sensed multimodal data. Then, a proposed graph neural network-based embedding algorithm can be performed based on a comprehensive understanding of the established IKG, to achieve semantic-based self-configurable solution searching and task decomposition. Moreover, a MARL-enabled decentralized system is presented to self-optimize the manufacturing process, and to further complement the IKG towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. An illustrative example of multi-robot reaching task is conducted lastly to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. As an explorative study, limitations and future perspectives are also highlighted to attract more open discussions and in-depth research for ever smarter manufacturing. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Cognitive manufacturing; Graph embedding; Graph neural network; Industrial knowledge graph; Reinforcement learning,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2021,Journal,Zheng P.; Xia L.; Li C.; Li X.; Liu B.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.08.002
Synthesized trust learning from limited human feedback for human-load-reduced multi-robot deployments,"Human multi-robot system (MRS) collaboration is demonstrating potentials in wide application scenarios due to the integration of human cognitive skills and a robot team's powerful capability introduced by its multi-member structure. However, due to limited human cognitive capability, a human cannot simultaneously monitor multiple robots and identify the abnormal ones, largely limiting the efficiency of the human-MRS collaboration. There is an urgent need to proactively reduce unnecessary human engagements and further reduce human cognitive loads. Human trust in human MRS collaboration reveals human expectations on robot performance. Based on trust estimation, the work between a human and MRS will be reallocated that an MRS will self-monitor and only request human guidance in critical situations. Inspired by that, a novel Synthesized Trust Learning (STL) method was developed to model human trust in the collaboration. STL explores two aspects of human trust (trust level and trust preference), meanwhile accelerates the convergence speed by integrating active learning to reduce human workload. To validate the effectiveness of the method, tasks ""searching victims in the context of city rescue""were designed in an open-world simulation environment, and a user study with 10 volunteers was conducted to generate real human trust feedback. The results showed that by maximally utilizing human feedback, the STL achieved higher accuracy in trust modeling with a few human feedback, effectively reducing human interventions needed for modeling an accurate trust, therefore reducing human cognitive load in the collaboration. © 2021 IEEE.",,"2021 30th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2021",2021,Conference,Pang Y.; Huang C.; Liu R.,10.1109/RO-MAN50785.2021.9515509

Seamless human–robot collaborative assembly using artificial intelligence and wearable devices,"Seamless human–robot collaboration requires the equipping of robots with cognitive capabilities that enable their awareness of the environment, as well as the actions that take place inside the assembly cell. This paper proposes an AI-based system comprised of three modules that can capture the operator and environment status and process status, identify the tasks that are being executed by the operator using vision-based machine learning, and provide customized operator support from the robot side for shared tasks, automatically adapting to the operator’s needs and preferences. Moreover, the proposed system is able to assess the ergonomics in human–robot shared tasks and adapt the robot pose to improve ergonomics using a heuristics-based search algorithm. An industrial case study derived from the elevator manufacturing sector using a high payload collaborative robot is presented to demonstrate that collaboration efficiency can be enhanced through the use of the discussed system. © 2021 by the authors.

Applying a fusion of wearable sensors and a cognitive inspired architecture to real-time ergonomics analysis of manual assembly tasks,"High value manufacturing systems still require ergonomically intensive manual activities. Examples include the aerospace industry where the fitting of pipes and wiring into confined spaces in aircraft wings is still a manual operation. In these environments, workers are subjected to ergonomically awkward forces and postures for long periods of time. This leads to musculoskeletal injuries that severely limit the output of a shopfloor leading to loss of productivity. The use of tools such as wearable sensors could provide a way to track the ergonomics of workers in real time. However, an information processing architecture is required in order to ensure that data is processed in real time and in a manner that meaningful action points are retrieved for use by workers. In this work, based on the Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R) cognitive framework, we propose a Cognitive Architecture for Wearable Sensors (CAWES); a wearable sensor system and cognitive architecture that is capable of taking data streams from multiple wearable sensors on a worker's body and fusing them to enable digitisation, tracking and analysis of human ergonomics in real time on a shopfloor. Furthermore, through tactile feedback, the architecture is able to inform workers in real time when ergonomics rules are broken. The architecture is validated through the use of an aerospace case study undertaken in laboratory conditions. The results from the validation are encouraging and in the future, further tests will be performed in an actual working environment. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Ergonomics; Manual assembly; Real-time; Wearable,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2021,Journal,Oyekan J.; Chen Y.; Turner C.; Tiwari A.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.09.015
A smart operator assistance system using deep learning for angle measurement,"— Manual workstations play a critical role in flexible assembly lines by enabling human responses to reconfiguration that is faster than machine responses. As a result, human is more adaptive and sometimes unreplaceable by machines in complex assembly. However, with the increasing complexity of tasks, product quality has become highly susceptible to human error due to increments in operators’ cognitive load. One of the errors that affect assembly quality is the operator’s use of a handheld tool with an unfavorable working angle when handling the workpiece. In this case, an assistive mechanism to remind workers about the wrong working angle is necessary to support the process. To this end, this study proposes an angle monitoring system to inspect the working angle of handheld tools and provide feedback in real time with minimal interruption to the assembly process. The proposed system consists of an angle measurement model and an action recognition model, which are both built using deep-learning-based object detection algorithm. Besides, the system was designed with flexibility that it is applicable to different tools and assembly tasks. A case study on fastening a high-end graphical processing unit card is investigated to evaluate their performance. Results show 95.83% and 99.83% accuracies of the models. In practice, the proposed study is expected to facilitate assembly quality by preventing the failure of angle-related operations in a timely and reliable manner. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Neuro-inspired Framework for Cognitive Manufacturing Control,"There are currently certain categories of manufacturing enterprises whose structure, organization and operating context have an extremely high degree of complexity, especially due to the way in which their various components interact and influence each other. For them, a series of paradigms have been developed, including intelligent manufacturing, smart manufacturing, cognitive manufacturing; which are based equally on information and knowledge management, management and interpretation of data flows and problem solving approaches. This work presents a new vision regarding the evolution of the future enterprise based on concepts and attributes acquired from the field of biology. Our approach addresses in a systemic manner the structural, functional, and behavioral aspects of the enterprise, seen as a complex dynamic system. In this article we are proposing an architecture and management methodology based on the human brain, where the problem solving is achieved by Perception – Memory – Learning and Behavior Generation mechanisms. In order to support the design of such an architecture and to allow a faster learning process, a software modeling and simulation platform was developed and is briefly presented. © 2021. by the authors.",Bio-inspired manufacturing control; Control Architecture; Internet of Things; Perception,"International Journal of Computers, Communications and Control",2021,Journal,Dumitrache I.; Caramihai S.I.; Popescu D.C.; Moisescu M.A.; Sacala I.S.,10.15837/IJCCC.2021.6.4519
Impact of Performance Lower Than Expectations on Work Behaviors: The Moderating Effect of Status Mutability and Mediating Role of Regulatory Focus,"Purpose: Drawing on social cognitive theory (SCT), this research aims to test the mediation of promotion focus motivation in between performance lower than expectations and innovative work behavior under the moderation of status hierarchy mutability. Further, low performance may also lead employees to counter-productivity through prevention focus. Thus, this study examines both sides of performance lower than expectations of the employee in the organization. Methodology: The study considered a cross-sectional study and surveyed R&D departments of manufacturing firms located in China. In total, 340 employees in 65 teams participated in the survey. This study conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to test the reliability and validity of data and used hierarchical linear modeling to test the hypotheses via Mplus 7.3. Findings: First, we reveal that employees’ performance lower than expectations is positively linked with promotion focus regulation. Second, the study’s outcomes reveal a positive indirect effect from employees’ higher status mutability in the group toward innovative work behaviour through promotion focus motivation. At last, the study identified that performance lower than expectations has a positive indirect impact on counterproductive behaviour via prevention focus. Practical Implications: This research assists managers to understand the connection of stress between performances lower than expectations and the self-regulated motivation of the employee towards innovative behavior and counterproductive work behavior. Further, it recommends that leaders at different levels should understand that various reference groups inside and outside the organization pressurize employees’ cognition. Therefore, certain steps and policies (eg, sensitive training, annual performance appraisal, feedback) must be taken into consideration to handle such self-regulatory behaviors. Originality: This study is the earliest to examine the performance expectations as an antecedent of innovative work behavior and counterproductive work behavior through regulatory focus. © 2021 Kumar et al.",counterproductive work behaviour; innovative work behaviour; performance lower than expectations; prevention focus; promotion focus; status hierarchy mutability,Psychology Research and Behavior Management,2021,Journal,Kumar N.; Hossain M.Y.; Jin Y.; Safeer A.A.; Chen T.,10.2147/PRBM.S342562

Wearable cognitive assistants in a factory setting: a critical review of a promising way of enhancing cognitive performance and well-being,"Rapid technological innovations are constantly influencing the complexification and automatization of the work lines pushing human operators to use diverse cognitive processes for supervising complex industrial machines. This urges factories to offer wearable cognitive assistants to human operators to analyze, integrate and maintain a considerable amount of information. The aim of this review is twofold. First, we borrow theoretical elements from the working memory literature to question the way these wearable cognitive assistants could optimize human operators’ cognitive load. Second, we argue that Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Job Characteristics Model (JCM) may theoretically predict the effectiveness of cognitive wearable assistants in enhancing the person–job fit, namely their cognitive performance and well-being. A critical review method was used to collect and summarize the most studied models associated with application of wearable devices in the workplace. Our review suggests that the current literature on working memory give useful insights concerning the way in which information should be displayed to operators to optimize the efficiency of wearable cognitive assistants. Moreover, JCM suggests original explanations on the way they can facilitate access to information and in turn increase job satisfaction. Finally, a small number of studies that used TAM with wearable devices in an industrial setting provide some interesting theoretical and empirical evidence on the acceptance of wearable cognitive assistants. As a conclusion, we argue that using wearable cognitive assistants properly would enhance both cognitive performance and well-being of human operators through promoting the person–job fit. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Human–machine interface; Job Characteristics Model; Person–job fit; Technology Acceptance Model; Wearable cognitive assistants; Working memory,"Cognition, Technology and Work",2021,Journal,Belletier C.; Charkhabi M.; Pires de Andrade Silva G.; Ametepe K.; Lutz M.; Izaute M.,10.1007/s10111-019-00610-2
From human-systems integration to human-systems inclusion for use-centred inclusive manufacturing control systems,"The paper discusses about human-systems inclusion as a new way to take into account human factors on systems engineering. This process applies not only principles from human-supported by automation but also those on automation-supported by human to improve autonomy between humans and machines and autonomy between people. The main concern of human-systems integration is the consideration of a low number of future users in the design process or of the feedback of a majority of users in the evaluation process. Human-system inclusion considers that the system has to take into account and adapt to all users whatever their social, economic, physical or cognitive state, or disability. The concept of “human in the loop” or of “human touch” is usually limited to the definition of the role of humans and machines. It does not consider dynamic variability of users and systems abilities, and anticipate the feasible development of autonomous machines by reducing progressively human engagement in the control and supervisory loop. The paper presents both integration and inclusion concepts for Industry 4.0, and then suggests some challenging perspectives for use-centred inclusive manufacturing control systems in terms of opportunities and threats. © 2021 The Authors.

Teaching Mode of Mechanical Manufacturing Specialty Based on the Network Teaching Platform,"The network teaching platform based on information technology is a challenge to the traditional teaching mode, and it is also an inevitable product of the development and maturity of information technology. This kind of learning platform is an online virtual learning environment that relies on computers and the Internet. It fully integrates mechanical related curriculum resources and has the advantages of good interactivity, strong immersion, and easy production and use. The purpose of this article is to study the teaching mode of mechanical manufacturing specialty under the network teaching platform. This article analyzes and compares the key contents such as the method of building a network virtual platform and the working principle of X3D virtual reality technology, and determines the key technology and overall plan for building a network teaching platform. This article uses CATIA to set and optimize the part model and generate file types that can be recognized by the X3D language to ensure a reasonable configuration of the start and stop time of each component in the motion mechanism, as well as the specific motion trajectory and rotation angle. Based on the interactive, immersive, easy-to-make and use virtual reality technology, this article integrates mechanical related professional knowledge resources to achieve the overall platform construction. It greatly improves the user's perception of the part model, is intuitive, flexible, and convenient, and truly gives the user a virtual and realistic operating experience, and finally realizes the dynamic interaction and perceptual communication between humans and models in a three-dimensional scene.

A CMOS-integrated radar-assisted cognitive sensing platform for seamless human-robot interactions,"With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, intelligent building techniques, robots are becoming more and more demanding for emerging new applications. For robots used in complex environments, precise sensing of its surroundings is essential to enable safe and robust operation. Comprehensive and cognitive perception capability is needed to recognize human subjects in a complex and dynamic environment to avoid the possible collisions. Moreover, comprehensive sensing is required to enable accurate simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) under scenarios with clutters and moving human subjects. To achieve the goal, a CMOS-integrated radar-assisted robot sensing platform is proposed. By leveraging the phased-array radar techniques and time-phase processing techniques, high accuracy can be achieved for localization and recognition of human subjects. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the chip-scale radar sensing platform is with compact size. A series of experiments have been carried out on verifying the capabilities of the radar platform for ranging and human recognition based on vital signs, exploring the potential for seamless human-robot interaction applications. © 2021 IEEE",CMOS; Cognitive sensing; Edge devices; Human/robot interaction; Internet of things (IoT); Mixed-signal IC; Radar; Robots; Sensor platform,Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems,2021,Conference,Fang Z.; Lou L.; Tang K.; Wang W.; Chen B.; Wang Y.; Zheng Y.,10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401535
Meta Preference Learning for Fast User Adaptation in Human-Supervisory Multi-Robot Deployments,"As multi-robot systems (MRS) are widely used in various tasks such as natural disaster response and social security, people enthusiastically expect an MRS to be ubiquitous that a general user without heavy training can easily operate. However, humans have various preferences on balancing between task performance and safety, imposing different requirements onto MRS control. Failing to comply with preferences makes people feel difficult in operation and decreases human willingness of using an MRS. Therefore, to improve social acceptance as well as performance, there is an urgent need to adjust MRS behaviors according to human preferences before triggering human corrections, which increases cognitive load. In this paper, a novel Meta Preference Learning (MPL) method was developed to enable an MRS to fast adapt to user preferences. MPL based on meta learning mechanism can quickly assess human preferences from limited instructions; then, a neural network based preference model adjusts MRS behaviors for preference adaption. To validate method effectiveness, a task scenario An MRS searches victims in an earthquake disaster site was designed; 20 human users were involved to identify preferences as {aggressive, medium, reserved}; based on user guidance and domain knowledge, about 20,000 preferences were simulated to cover different operations related to {task quality, task progress, robot safety}. The effectiveness of MPL in preference adaption was validated by the reduced duration and frequency of human interventions.  © 2021 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,2021,Conference,Huang C.; Luo W.; Liu R.,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636515
Cloning and training collective intelligence with generative adversarial networks,"Industry 4.0 and highly automated critical infrastructure can be seen as cyber-physical-social systems controlled by the Collective Intelligence. Such systems are essential for the functioning of the society and economy. On one hand, they have flexible infrastructure of heterogeneous systems and assets. On the other hand, they are social systems, which include collaborating humans and artificial decision makers. Such (human plus machine) resources must be pre-trained to perform their mission with high efficiency. Both human and machine learning approaches must be bridged to enable such training. The importance of these systems requires the anticipation of the potential and previously unknown worst-case scenarios during training. In this paper, we provide an adversarial training framework for the collective intelligence. We show how cognitive capabilities can be copied (“cloned”) from humans and trained as a (responsible) collective intelligence. We made some modifications to the Generative Adversarial Networks architectures and adapted them for the cloning and training tasks. We modified the Discriminator component to a so-called “Turing Discriminator”, which includes one or several human and artificial discriminators working together. We also discussed the concept of cellular intelligence, where a person can act and collaborate in a group together with their own cognitive clones. © 2021 The Authors.

Collaborative architecture for human-robot assembly tasks using multimodal sensors,"Human robot collaboration in manufacturing environments lacks adaptability to different tasks and environments as well as fluency of interaction with workers. This work looks at developing a cognitive architecture for assembly robots allowing prediction of when collaborative actions are required. The cognitive architecture provides reliable perception and reasoning methods for increased human-robot fluency allowing the user to focus on the required task. The system has three layers; the perception layer determines the current task state while the memory layer keeps track of task details, current predictions and past episodes. The control layer predicts future collaborative actions and passes commands to the robot at the required time to reduce user idle time. The system uses inertial measurement unit convolutional neural network action recognition and vision recognition for environment perception. The cognitive architecture is validated with experiments in offline and real-time modes. In offline mode, two action recognition methods are performed, with one classifier for all actions achieving accuracy of 81% and a separate classifier for each action achieving 74%. In real-time mode, a UR3 cobot is used for a collaborative assembly task where an increase in the proportion of time the user is active is shown.  © 2021 IEEE.",,"2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics, ICAR 2021",2021,Conference,Male J.; Martinez-Hernandez U.,10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659382
Towards large-scale evaluation of mental stress and biomechanical strain in manufacturing environments using 3D-referenced gaze and wearable-based analytics,"In future manufacturing human-machine interaction will evolve towards flexible and smart collaboration. It will meet requirements from the optimization of assembly processes as well as from motivated and skilled human behavior. Recently, human factors engineering has substantially progressed by means of detailed task analysis. However, there is still a lack in precise measuring cognitive and sensorimotor patterns for the analysis of long-term mental and physical strain. This work presents a novel methodology that enables real-time measurement of cognitive load based on executive function analyses as well as biomechanical strain from non-obtrusive wearable sensors. The methodology works on 3D information recovery of the working cell using a precise stereo measurement device. The worker is equipped with eye tracking glasses and a set of wearable accelerometers. Wireless connectivity transmits the sensor-based data to a nearby PC for monitoring. Data analytics then recovers the 3D geometry of gaze and viewing frustum within the working cell and furthermore extracts the worker's task switching rate as well as a skeleton-based approximation of worker's posture associated with an estimation of biomechanical strain of muscles and joints.

Evaluating Electroencephalogram Channels using Machine Learning Models for Drowsiness Detection,"The oil and gas (O&G) industry has suffered several catastrophic accidents over the years, and many of which are attributed to human factors. Indeed, human operators continue to play a central role in performing complex tasks in which cognitive functions i nfluence their performance, especially in emergency situations. However, operators may not effectively respond when presenting tiredness, such as mental fatigue and/or drowsiness. Therefore, the development of a drowsiness detection system is desirable for industries dealing with safety-critical tasks, such as control rooms in O&G context. In this paper, we analyzed two electroencephalogram (EEG) channels: Fz and Pz. The data are processed based on distinct time-domain signal representation, analyzed through four well-known Machine Learning (ML) classification techniques in order to identify patterns related to drowsiness in different subjects submitted to monotonous tasks. We perform all analysis and comparisons considering a real and public database for human drowsiness. For most of the subjects analyzed, the ML models achieved a balanced accuracy (BA) greater than 95% when considering information of a single channel, which makes the drowsiness detection system less invasive, and then opens the possibility of using it in an actual environment. © ESREL 2021.

A proposal of accessibility guidelines for human-robot interaction,"We will increasingly become dependent on automation to support our manufacturing and daily living, and robots are likely to take an important place in this. Unfortunately, currently not all the robots are accessible for all users. This is due to the different characteristics of users, as users with visual, hearing, motor or cognitive disabilities were not considered during the design, imple-mentation or interaction phase, causing accessibility barriers to users who have limitations. This research presents a proposal for accessibility guidelines for human-robot interaction (HRI). The guidelines have been evaluated by seventeen HRI designers and/or developers. A questionnaire of nine five-point Likert Scale questions and 6 open-ended questions was developed to evaluate the proposed guidelines for developers and designers, in terms of four main factors: usability, social acceptance, user experience and social impact. The questions act as indicators for each factor. The majority (15 of 17 participants) agreed that the guidelines are helpful for them to design and imple-ment accessible robot interfaces and applications. Some of them had considered some ad hoc guidelines in their design practice, but none of them showed awareness of or had applied all the proposed guidelines in their design practice, 72% of the proposed guidelines have been applied by less than or equal to 8 participants for each guideline. Moreover, 16 of 17 participants would use the proposed guidelines in their future robot designs or evaluation. The participants recommended the importance of aligning the proposed guidelines with safety requirements, environment of interaction (indoor or outdoor), cost and users’ expectations. © 2021 by the authors.

Human Expertise Inspired Smart Sensing and Manufacturing,"With the new era of the fourth industrial revolution, adopting human skills and knowledge is getting more valuable to enable smart manufacturing. Moreover, a cognitive ability that comes from human sensory and intuition is able to facilitate smart sensing and collaboration between humans and autonomy. For smart manufacturing, the improvement of collaboration of humans, autonomy, and physical systems is essential. In this paper, an immersive and interactive cyber-physical system (I2CPS) is suggested to achieve efficient collaboration between humans and autonomy. Virtual reality (VR) with a game engine, a new middleware, and a data-to-information protocol were introduced for I2CPS. This system was utilized in an autonomous robot grasping platform constructed by human skills and self-learning. The initial convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained by manual demonstration and showed 39% of the success rate of grasping blocks. After self-learning, the success rate increased to 70%. As another human-inspired sensing technique, sound recognition system using ambient sound and the CNN model to predict the running state of the generator is proposed. The Mel spectrum based on human hearings was used as feature extraction. The overall running prediction accuracy of the evaluation dataset showed approximately 95%. This system was applied for web-based remote and real-time monitoring of generators. © 2021 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network (CNN); Immersive and interactive cyber-physical system (I2CPS); Smart manufacturing; Sound monitoring,"Proceedings of International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, ICECIT 2021",2021,Conference,Jun M.B.G.; Yun H.; Kim E.,10.1109/ICECIT54077.2021.9641237
Machine learning-based cognitive position and force controls for power-assisted human-robot collaborative manipulation,"Manipulation of heavy objects in industries is very necessary, but manual manipulation is tedious, adversely affects a worker’s health and safety, and reduces efficiency. On the contrary, autonomous robots are not flexible to manipulate heavy objects. Hence, we proposed human-robot systems, such as power assist systems, to manipulate heavy objects in industries. Again, the selection of appropriate control methods as well as inclusion of human factors in the controls is important to make the systems human friendly. However, existing power assist systems do not address these issues properly. Hence, we present a 1-DoF (degree of freedom) testbed power assist robotic system for lifting different objects. We also included a human factor, such as weight perception (a cognitive cue), in the robotic system dynamics and derived several position and force control strategies/methods for the system based on the human-centric dynamics. We developed a reinforcement learning method to predict the control parameters producing the best/optimal control performance. We also derived a novel adaptive control algorithm based on human characteristics. We experimentally evaluated those control methods and compared the system performance between the control methods. Results showed that both position and force controls produced satisfactory performance, but the position control produced significantly better performance than the force controls. We then proposed using the results to design control methods for power assist robotic systems for handling large and heavy materials and objects in various industries, which may improve human-robot interactions (HRIs) and system performance. © 2021 by the authors.

Worker-in-the-Loop Cyber-Physical System for Safe Human-Robot Collaboration in Construction,"Efficient implementation of robots in dynamic, human-populated construction sites will require the assistance and supervision of workers. Several hazards exist when workers are within the robots' working envelope, including high mental stress induced by the robot as well as the risk of physical collision. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes a cyber-physical system (CPS) for safe, worker-centered human-robot collaboration (HRC). The physical components of the CPS include a wearable biosensor for assessing workers' mental conditions and a video camera for evaluating the risk of collision accidents. The cyber component incorporates a machine learning layer that employs a kernelized logistic regression to translate worker bio-signals into distinct physiological states. Simultaneously, the system monitors the relative distance between workers and robots by applying computer vision techniques (i.e., video frame differencing, dilation, and contour detection). To test the feasibility of the proposed CPS, six subjects were asked to perform a series of bricklaying tasks jointly with a vehicle robot with different risks of collision (various distances from the robot) and at different levels of cognitive load (various tasks' complexity). The findings revealed that the proposed CPS allows the co-bot to adjust its speed relative to the subject's physiological states with 93.70% accuracy. In addition, the proposed system shows promising performance in collision avoidance with the accurate monitoring of position between robots and humans. The results unfold the feasibility of the proposed CPS in enhancing safe and intelligent HRC in construction under the trend of Industry 4.0. © 2021 Computing in Civil Engineering 2021 - Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2021.

Coupling dimensions of human resource archetypes and organizational learning modes; [人力资源形态与组织学习方式的耦合维度],"In order to provide channels of human resource management in promoting organizational learning, structural equation models were used for identifying the differences in the coupling dimensions between human resource archetypes and organizational learning modes based on sample data of 219 manufacturing firms with more than 100 employees. It is found that the coupling of the cooperative human resource archetype and exploitative learning is reflected in the mechanistic structure dimension; the coupling of the cooperative human resource archetype and exploratory learning is reflected in the two dimensions of the mechanistic structure and specialist cognition; the coupling of the entrepreneurial human resource archetype and exploitative learning is reflected in the two dimensions of generalist cognition and cognitive trust; the coupling of the entrepreneurial human resource archetype and exploratory learning is reflected in the dimension of generalist cognition. When manufacturing firms pursue exploitative learning, it is suggested that they pay attention to the structure dimension management of the collaborative human resource archetype and the cognition and affect dimensions management of the entrepreneurial human resource archetype. When manufacturing firms pursue exploratory learning, it is suggested pay attention to the structure and cognition dimensions management of the collaborative human resource archetype and the cognition dimension management of the entrepreneurial human resource archetype. © 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University.

On the contribution to the alignment during an organizational change: Measurement of job satisfaction with working conditions,"Introduction: Modern approaches to Occupational Health and Safety have acknowledged the important contribution that continuous improvements to working conditions can make to the motivation of employees, their subsequent performance, and therefore to the competitiveness of the company. Despite this fact, organizational change initiatives represent a path less traveled by employees. Specialized literature has drawn on the fact that employees’ satisfaction presents both the foundation and catalyst for effective implementation of improvements to working conditions. Method: This paper conceptualizes the alignment of employees through measurement of job satisfaction and uses the Bayesian Network to assess the influence of human factors, particularly the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects. Toward this aim, the Bayesian Network is evaluated through a cross-validation process, and a sensitivity analysis is then conducted for each influential dimension: emotional, cognitive, and behavioral. Results: The results reveal that these three dimensions are interrelated and have a direct influence on job satisfaction and employees’ alignment during the organization change. Further, they suggest that the best strategy for enhanced alignment and smooth conduct of organizational changes is simultaneous enhancement of the three dimensions. Practical applications: This study shows the influence of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions on job satisfaction and employees’ alignment during the organizational change. Furthermore, it elaborates the way to develop efficient and effective strategies for a successful change implementation and sustained alignment. © 2020",Alignment; Bayesian Networks; Health and safety; Organizational change; Working conditions,Journal of Safety Research,2021,Journal,Boulagouas W.; García-Herrero S.; Chaib R.; Herrera García S.; Djebabra M.,10.1016/j.jsr.2020.12.006
Survey on Interface Usability Evaluation for Oil and Gas Critical Control Systems,"Usability is the key to develop and improve any system as it represents the direct contact point between users and machines. The use of the critical control system in the oil and gas industry is increasing. Due to the complexity of these systems, its interface usability should be assessed and developed periodically. In this research, the attributes that affect interface usability are identified. The usability of the Torque Turns System (TTS) is evaluated since the periods of downtime is projected to increase in the field. There are some works similar to our work however none of them had collected data directly from real operators from the field. An evaluation of the torque turn system interface usability is performed using questionnaire related to common interface usability attributes including accessibility, learnability, effectiveness, memorability, efficiency, safety, cognitive load, understandability, and satisfaction. The findings indicate a potential weakness in terms of understandability and accessibility  © 2021 IEEE.",Energy informatics; Human Computer Interaction; Oil and Gas sector; System usability; Torque Turn Systems; User Interface; User performance,"2nd International Informatics and Software Engineering Conference, IISEC 2021",2021,Conference,Alrawi L.N.; Ashour O.I.; Zeain A.,10.1109/IISEC54230.2021.9672449
Virtual training for assembly tasks: A framework for the analysis of the cognitive impact on operators,"The importance of training for operators in industrial contexts is widely highlighted in literature. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is considered an efficient solution for training, since it provides immersive, realistic, and interactive simulations environments where the operator can learn-by-doing, far from the risks of the real field. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by several studies, but a proper assessment of the operator's cognitive response in terms of stress and cognitive load, during the use of such technology, is still lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of user's cognitive states, suitable for each kind of training in the industrial sector and beyond. Preliminary feasibility analysis refers to virtual training for assembly of agricultural vehicles. The proposed protocol analysis allowed understanding the operators' loads to optimize the VR training application, considering the mental demand during the training, and thus avoiding stress, mental overload, improving the user performance. © 2021 The Authors.

COLLABORATIVE ROBOTICS AND ERGONOMICS: A SCIENTIFIC REVIEW,"Collaborative robotics, or Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), is a challenging topic characterized by multidisciplinary approaches. Many researchers are facing this innovative manufacturing system studying several aspects such as task allocation, facility layout problem and timing. Above all, one of the most important issues in collaborative robotics is the wellbeing of the operator collaborating with the robot system during the different phases of the process. The added value of a collaborative workplace respect to the manual and automatic workplaces is strictly correlated to a safe and ergonomic interaction between the operator and the robot. Indeed, the combination of robot and operator skills lead to a higher level of accuracy and flexibility. Thus, assessing operator's working conditions requires the acquisition, eventually in real time, of relevant parameters such as posture, movements, and interactive tasks. This may require the adoption of existing metrics proposed by standard evaluation guidelines, as well as the introduction of new or modified prescription to consider the presence of the robot. The ergonomics analysis in collaborative robotics is evaluated by considering both physical and cognitive aspects of the operator during the interaction with the robot. The research work aims to carry out a scientific bibliometric literature review (BLR) about the ergonomics analysis of collaborative workplaces, and to identify methods and tools for the physical and cognitive ergonomics assessment that can be adopted in collaborative robotics. The search has been accomplished using the Scopus database by means of a set of key words specifically defined to investigate the ergonomics in the collaborative robotics. The review provides a sharp classification, a critical analysis of the most relevant contributions in this field so that emerging trends for future development can be defined and discussed. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Cognitive visual anomaly detection with constrained latent representations for industrial inspection robot,"With the fast growth of intelligent manufacturing industry, developing advanced industrial inspection robots is becoming a research and application hotspot in the fields of both computer vision and robotics. This kind of industrial inspection robots is expected to automatically detect anomalous structures (e.g., defects, damages, rejects, etc.) from the images of the manufactured products. Generally, the existing visual anomaly detection (VAD) methods mainly focus on modeling the complex and high-dimensional distribution of normal data, while neglecting the specific visual properties of abnormal data since their frequency of occurrence is much less than that of the normal data. In this paper, inspired by the human cognition on extracting abstractly visual properties and to distinguish the anomaly patterns from the observed data, we propose a novel cognitive VAD method for industrial inspection robot. Specifically, we introduce a constrained latent space to mimic the cognitive ability of humans, where the abstraction learned from the observed normal and anomaly data are represented. We build our method based on a convolutional generative adversarial network and a denoising auto-encoder, where the adversarial learning mechanism is adopted to establish the boundary between the normal and anomaly data. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real-world dataset where the images are captured for the manufactured products. The comprehensive results comparing with several recent VAD methods show that the proposed method is effective to detect the anomaly images of different categories with a high accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Cognitive computing; Industrial inspection robot; Latent space representations; Visual anomaly detection,Applied Soft Computing Journal,2020,Journal,Li J.; Xu X.; Gao L.; Wang Z.; Shao J.,10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106539
Lessons Lost: What We Learned About Automation in Aviation Can Be Applied to Autonomous Vehicles,"As research related to automation in aviation evolved from human factors to cognitive engineering and from automation to autonomy, a whole generation of research has been forgotten. With one third of the engineering work force retired or retiring, in the next 10 years (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018) the lessons of the past are being lost. To preserve some of the lessons learned, I wrote seven articles that are currently on The MITRE Corporation web site.

Cyber-physical operator assistance systems in industry: Cross-hierarchical perspectives on augmenting human abilities,"In production systems, manual tasks need to be considered more than the sum of repetitive sub-tasks which can simply be taken over by autonomous systems. Despite technological advances in automation, the presence of human operators remains essential on future shop floors. Consequently, it is of interest for manufacturing organizations how cyber-physical operator assistance systems (C.O.A.S.) can augment skills of operators on the shop floor. However, there is a limited understanding of how relevant stakeholders in manufacturing organizations assess the suitability of COAS. This is crucial in so far as the adoption of COAS significantly depends on the approval of stakeholders throughout the respective manufacturing organization. This paper explores how stakeholders in manufacturing organizations assess the role of COAS on future shop floors. This is realized by conducting an exploratory, multi-method, qualitative study encompassing interviews of executives, instructors, and operators. Additionally, the study incorporates ethnographic observations in industrial education. A result of the study is that informants expect COAS to be promising for manufacturing organizations if systems augment cognitive abilities of operators, rather than their physical abilities.  © 2020 IEEE.",Cyber-physical production system; Human-centric production; Human-computer interaction; Industry 4.0; Operator assistance systems; Worker support,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,2020,Conference,Moencks M.; Roth E.; Bohne T.,10.1109/IEEM45057.2020.9309734
Augmented Reality for Manual Assembly in Industry 4.0: Gathering Guidelines,"The manufacturing industry always strugle to maintain competitiveness and lowering its production costs. With the significant improvement in the reliability and stability of facilities, human error has become one of the most critical factors for quality assurance. About 70% to 90% of quality defects in assembly production systems are directly or indirectly caused by human errors. In the last decades, the interest in using Augmented Reality (AR) in many application areas, including the industry, has increased. Although AR is recognized as an important technology, there is an evident gap in design guidelines and methodologies in this field. The objective of this paper is to find guidelines to help in designing AR-based manual assembly systems. We did a systematic literature mapping over scientific review papers, from 2015 to 2020, and found 14 review papers. From 14 papers, 11 of them (78,6%) presented guidelines topics. The guidelines found were classified into four groups: usability, cognitive, ergonomics, and corporate-related. The suggested group of general guidelines based on previous work may be useful as a starting point when designing AR-based manual assembly systems. We conclude that a comprehensive set, that encompasses general and specific guidelines, depends on the characteristics of the assembly line being implemented. Limitations of this work are the low number of review papers found and the probability of having new guideline categories not found in this paper.  © 2020 IEEE.",Augmented Reality; Design Guidelines; Industry 4.0; Manual Assembly; Production System,"Proceedings - 2020 22nd Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality, SVR 2020",2020,Conference,Agati S.S.; Bauer R.D.; Hounsell M.D.S.; Paterno A.S.,10.1109/SVR51698.2020.00039
Cognitive manufacturing in industry 4.0 toward cognitive load reduction: A conceptual framework,"Cognitive manufacturing utilizes cognitive computing, the industrial Internet of things (IoT), and advanced analytics to upgrade manufacturing processes in manners that were not previously conceivable. It enables associations to improve major business measurements, for example, productivity, product reliability, quality, and safety, while decreasing downtime and lowering costs. Considering all the facts that can prejudice the manufacturing performance in Industry 4.0, the cognitive load has received more attention, since it was previously neglected with respect to manufacturing industries. This paper aims to investigate what causes cognitive load reduction in manufacturing environments, i.e., human–computer interaction technologies that reduce the identified causes and the applications of cognitive manufacturing that use the referred technologies. Thus, a conceptual framework that links cognitive manufacturing to a reduction of the cognitive load was developed. © 2020 by the authors.

Production Innovation and Effective Dissemination of Information for Operator 4.0,"The manufacturing industry is becoming increasingly more complex as the paradigm of mass-production moves, via mass-customization, towards personalized production and Industry 4.0. This increased complexity in the production system also makes everyday work for shop-floor operators more complex. To take advantage of this complexity, shop-floor operators need to be properly supported in order to perform their important work. The shop-floor operators in this future complex manufacturing industry, the Operator 4.0, need to be supported with the implementation of new cognitive automation solutions. These automation solutions, together with the innovativeness of new processes and organizations will increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. This paper discusses three different aspects of production innovation in the context of the needs and preferences of information for Operator 4.0. Conclusively, product innovations can be applied in the manufacturing processes, and thus becoming process innovations, but the implementation of such innovations require organizational innovations. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",human-centred production; Industry 4.0; information dissemination; Operator 4.0; Production innovation,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,2020,Conference,Li D.; Fast-Berglund A.; Paulin D.,10.3233/ATDE200160
A day in the life of frontline manufacturing personnel: A diary-based safety study,"Recorded incidences of work-related illness and injury within the manufacturing sector remain significantly high, therefore, an awareness of the aetiology of accidents remains integral to any realistic prospect of safety improvement interventions within this complex industry. The epistemological stance adopted in safety behaviour development in research design and execution has largely focused on empirical outcome-based studies. Using personalised individual diaries to record real time data of safety-related events, including social cognitive contextual details, this study, for the first time qualitatively explores employee recorded incidents, permitting the identification of perceived latent conditions belying cognitive errors. The study revealed the most frequently occurring incident types were unsafe acts (38%) followed by unsafe conditions (28%), with a greater proportion of near misses (N = 46) in comparison to actual accidents (N = 13). Also apparent were inconsistencies in formal and informal reporting processes. Skill based errors were the most prevalent recorded human error type associated with distraction, alongside incompatible work environments. Violations were evident, to a lesser degree of recordable incidents. Across all human error types, qualitative accounts of safety climate concepts including leader violations and quality of leadership were described. The study thus made possible the capture of day-to-day safety behaviours and conditions, illuminating new perspectives on meaningful issues at both individual and systems levels. Adopting a systematically tailored approach to the exploration of suboptimal safety behaviour aetiology, there is a greater likelihood of knowledge acquisition of incidents or symptoms at an organisational level, which are then equipped to reflexively respond with a tailored address of these issues ‘in situ’. © 2020",Accident causation; Accident reporting; Diary; Human Error,Safety Science,2020,Journal,Pickup S.; Paton K.; Hayes C.; Morrison B.,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104992
How human factors affect operators' task evolution in Logistics 4.0,"The spread of the Industry 4.0 paradigm introduced an increasing number of technological innovations into companies to improve logistics processes. During a transition to Logistics 4.0, it is necessary to consider all the issues that affect logistics, among which human factors (HF) are considered to be the most important. On the basis of the existing scientific literature, this article aimed to identify the relationships between 4.0 technologies implementation and HF concerning the evolution of human activities towards different hypothetical future scenarios (i.e., no changes, work replaced, or work assisted), analysing in detail the HF affected by 4.0 technologies. These relationships, which were summarised in a matrix, were also tested through a single longitudinal case study. The research showed that technology tends to replace logistics operators, not only for dangerous physical tasks but also for cognitive tasks that are stressful and repetitive. Moreover, for some tasks in which many different HF are involved, the evolution is towards operator assistance, rather than replacement. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",case study; human factors; Logistics 4.0; logistics operator; task evolution,Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing,2021,Journal,Cimini C.; Lagorio A.; Pirola F.; Pinto R.,10.1002/hfm.20872
Evaluating Mixed and Augmented Reality: A Systematic Literature Review (2009-2019),"We present a systematic review of 45S papers that report on evaluations in mixed and augmented reality (MR/AR) published in ISMAR, CHI, IEEE VR, and UIST over a span of 11 years (2009-2019). Our goal is to provide guidance for future evaluations of MR/AR approaches. To this end, we characterize publications by paper type (e.g., technique, design study), research topic (e.g., tracking, rendering), evaluation scenario (e.g., algorithm performance, user performance), cognitive aspects (e.g., perception, emotion), and the context in which evaluations were conducted (e.g., lab vs. in-thewild). We found a strong coupling of types, topics, and scenarios. We observe two groups: (a) technology-centric performance evaluations of algorithms that focus on improving tracking, displays, reconstruction, rendering, and calibration, and (b) human-centric studies that analyze implications of applications and design, human factors on perception, usability, decision making, emotion, and attention. Amongst the 458 papers, we identified 248 user studies that involved 5,761 participants in total, of whom only 1,619 were identified as female. We identified 43 data collection methods used to analyze 10 cognitive aspects. We found nine objective methods, and eight methods that support qualitative analysis. A majority (216/248) of user studies are conducted in a laboratory setting. Often (138/248), such studies involve participants in a static way. However, we also found a fair number (30/248) of in-the-wild studies that involve participants in a mobile fashion. We consider this paper to be relevant to academia and industry alike in presenting the state-of-the-art and guiding the steps to designing, conducting, and analyzing results of evaluations in MR/AR.  © 2020 IEEE.",A.1 [General Literature]; Computer Graphics; Evaluation; I.3.7 [Computing Methodologies]; Introductory and Survey; Mixed and Augmented Reality; Systematic Literature Review; Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, ISMAR 2020",2020,Conference,Merino L.; Schwarzl M.; Kraus M.; Sedlmair M.; Schmalstieg D.; Weiskopf D.,10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00069
"An empirical investigation on association between human factors, ergonomics and lean manufacturing","Most adopters focussed on lean tools and techniques (hard lean practices) alone and neglected human factors and ergonomics (soft lean practices) while implementing lean in an organisation. The implementation of hard lean practices alone worsens workers’ Quality of Work Life (QWL) which results in obtaining anticipated long-term lean performance. To promote the adaptation of soft lean practices, the study aimed to highlight the significance of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) in lean performance and sustainability through structural equation modelling using survey data from 168 experts involved in lean environments. The study documented that the degree of lean performance is positively related to HFE. Also, it found that psychosocial and physical factors influence lean performance enhancement more than others do whereas cognitive factors influence them the least. The study will help managers and researchers understand the relationship between HFE and lean performance and thus help to solve human-related issues in a lean environment and lean system design for successful implementation. Finally, the implications, limitations and future scope of the study are discussed elaborately. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",human factors and ergonomics; human-centered lean; Lean performance; quality of work life; sociotechnical system; structural equation model,Production Planning and Control,2021,Journal,Sakthi Nagaraj T.; Jeyapaul R.,10.1080/09537287.2020.1810815
Cognitive Production Systems: A Mapping Study,"In order to guarantee the quality and the productivity of a production system in a competitive marketplace, it is important to be able anticipate the changes in specifications of products and systems. The time limits in running productions, the complexity of manufacturing systems, and the diversification of components, are the challenges that human experts cannot handle without cognitive systems. Capabilities of cognitive Systems in observing, learning, and predicting the behavior and the evolution of the manufacturing systems make them special candidates for solving these problems. This mapping study provides an insight into the application of cognitive systems in the domain of production. We categorize different approaches and estimate their progress. We also discuss the optimizations and persisting problems and barriers. These representations can help in recognizing the concrete problems of the field. According to the results of our mapping study, Human-Machine Interaction and Knowledge Gaining/Sharing represents the largest categories of the domain.

Effects of augmented reality glasses on the cognitive load of assembly operators in the automotive industry,"Recently, new digital technologies are frequently used in the industry within the scope of Industry 4.0. Augmented reality (AR) is one of these emerging technologies; it assists users with the help of virtual images on the real display of the work environment. Although AR benefits employees in terms of productivity and quality, it is not precisely known if it has a cognitive effect on the employees. In this study, the effect of AR glasses on the cognitive loads of the employees was investigated. The experiments were carried out on the assembly line of an automobile company. Electroencephalography (EEG) and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) were used to measure cognitive load. The current and AR-based work procedures were examined comparatively. Also, the difference between the cognitive load on the first and last days of experiments was compared to determine the adaptation status of the employees. The average of the area under the EEG graph as a measure of cognitive load, were 18.96 and 5.24 μV*ms in employees working with and without AR glasses, respectively. NASA-TLX scores of the employees decreased by 10% when they work with AR glasses. So, there was a less cognitive load on employees in the case of using AR glasses. And there was no significant difference between the first and last days of device usage. Hence, AR glasses did not constitute an extra cognitive load from the first day of usage. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Augmented Reality (AR); automotive industry; cognitive workload; Electroencephalography (EEG); Neuroergonomics,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,2021,Journal,Atici-Ulusu H.; Ikiz Y.D.; Taskapilioglu O.; Gunduz T.,10.1080/0951192X.2021.1901314
Development and validation of a simulation workload measure: the simulation task load index (SIM-TLX),"Virtual reality (VR) simulation offers significant potential for human factors training as it provides a novel approach which enables training in environments that are otherwise dangerous, impractical or expensive to simulate. While VR training has been adopted in many environments, such as heavy industry, surgery and aviation, there remains an inadequate understanding of how virtual simulations impact cognitive factors. One such factor, which needs careful consideration during the design of VR simulations, is the degree of mental or cognitive load experienced during training. This study aimed to validate a newly developed measure of workload, based on existing instruments (e.g. the NASA-TLX), but tailored to the specific demands placed on users of simulated environments. While participants completed a VR puzzle game, a series of experimental manipulations of workload were used to assess the sensitivity of the new instrument. The manipulations affected the questionnaire subscales (mental demands; physical demands; temporal demands; frustration; task complexity; situational stress; distraction; perceptual strain; task control; presence) as predicted in all cases (ps <.05), except for presence, which displayed little relationship with other aspects of task load. The scale was also found to have good convergent validity with an alternate index of task load. The findings support the sensitivity of the new instrument for assessing task load in virtual reality. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of mental workload in simulated environments and provides a practical tool for use in both future research and applications in the field. © 2019, The Author(s).",Cognitive load; Learning; Training; Virtual reality; Workload,Virtual Reality,2020,Journal,Harris D.; Wilson M.; Vine S.,10.1007/s10055-019-00422-9
Toward a Definition of Cognitive-Driven Development,"Software separation into components is a recognition that human work can be improved by focus on a limited set of data. The growing complexity of software has always been a challenge to industry. Several approaches have been proposed to support code design based on architectural styles and code quality metrics. However, most research involving human cognition in software engineering is focused on the evaluation of programs and learning instead of how the source code could be developed under this perspective. This paper presents an approach called Cognitive-Driven Development (CDD) that is based on cognitive complexity measurements and Cognitive Load Theory. This strategy can reduce the cognitive overload of the developers through the limitation of intrinsic complexity points from source code. Some cognitive complexity metrics has been extended and guidelines are presented to calculate the intrinsic complexity points and how their limit can be adapted under certain quality criteria. Experimental studies are currently being conducted to evaluate the CDD. Preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce the future effort for maintenance and fixing software faults. © 2020 IEEE.",Cognitive complexity; Cognitive-driven development; Software design,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2020",2020,Conference,Oliveira A.L.; De Souza T.; Costa Pinto V.H.S.,10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00087
A Sense of Quality for Augmented Reality Assisted Process Guidance,"The ongoing automation of modern production processes requires novel human-computer interaction concepts that support employees in dealing with the unstoppable increase in time pressure, cognitive load, and the required fine-grained and process-specific knowledge. Augmented Reality (AR) systems support employees by guiding and teaching work processes. Such systems still lack a precise process quality analysis (monitoring), which is, however, crucial to close gaps in the quality assurance of industrial processes.We combine inertial sensors, mounted on work tools, with AR headsets to enrich modern assistance systems with a sense of process quality. For this purpose, we develop a Machine Learning (ML) classifier that predicts quality metrics from a 9-degrees of freedom inertial measurement unit, while we simultaneously guide and track the work processes with a HoloLens AR system. In our user study, 6 test subjects perform typical assembly tasks with our system. We evaluate the tracking accuracy of the system based on a precise optical reference system and evaluate the classification of each work step quality based on the collected ground truth data. Our evaluation shows a tracking accuracy of fast dynamic movements of 4.92mm and our classifier predicts the actions carried out with mean F1 value of 93.8% on average.  © 2020 IEEE.",Human computer interaction (HCI); Human-centered computing; Interaction paradigms; Mixed / augmented reality,"Adjunct Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, ISMAR-Adjunct 2020",2020,Conference,Redzepagic A.; Loffler C.; Feigl T.; Mutschler C.,10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct51615.2020.00046
"Human factors, ergonomics and Industry 4.0 in the Oil&Gas industry: A bibliometric analysis","Over the last few years, the Human Factors and Ergonomics (HF/E) discipline has significantly benefited from new human-centric engineered digital solutions of the 4.0 industrial age. Technologies are creating new socio-technical interactions between human and machine that minimize the risk of design-induced human errors and have largely contributed to remarkable improvements in terms of process safety, productivity, quality, and workers' well-being. However, despite the Oil&Gas (O&G) sector is one of the most hazardous environments where human error can have severe consequences, Industry 4.0 aspects are still scarcely integrated with HF/E. This paper calls for a holistic understanding of the changing role and responsibilities of workers in the O&G industry and aims at investigating to what extent, what type of, and how academic publications in the O&G field integrate HF/E and Industry 4.0 in their research. Bibliometric analysis has been conducted to provide useful insights to researchers and practitioners and to assess the status quo.

Towards a Real-Time Cognitive Load Assessment System for Industrial Human-Robot Cooperation,"Robots are increasingly present in environments shared with humans. Robots can cooperate with their human teammates to achieve common goals and complete tasks. This paper focuses on developing a real-time framework that assesses the cognitive load of a human while cooperating with a robot to complete a collaborative assembly task. The framework uses multi-modal sensory data from Electrocardiography (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, extracts novel features from the data, and utilizes machine learning methodologies to detect high or low cognitive load. The developed framework was evaluated on a collaborative assembly scenario with a user study.

Research on the human-computer interaction design in mobile phones,"Mobile phones play an important role in our modern life. Meanwhile, the development of human-computer interaction has promoted the progress of the mobile phone industry. A good human-computer interaction design model needs to consider the user's understanding of the product system, but also needs to use ergonomics and cognitive psychology to carry out in-depth analysis and research on the user. The emergence of mobile communications and cloud computing technologies has also changed people's lifestyles. Firstly, through the discussion and research on the relationship between human-computer interaction and ergonomics and cognitive psychology, some key points that human-computer interaction design can influence the development trend of mobile phones are proposed. This article will also point out the impact of communication technology and cloud computing technology on mobile phones and people's lifestyles. Besides, the different operating systems of mobile phones will be compared and analyzed. Due to the different human-computer interaction experience in different user groups, the different requirements of them on a mobile phone will be analyzed. At the same time, the article also pays attention to the social problems caused by people's over-reliance on mobile phones. Finally, this article will make a reasonable prediction of the future development trend of mobile phones. © 2020 IEEE",Cloud computing; Human-computer interaction; Mobile communication; Smart phones; User experience,"Proceedings - 2020 International Conference on Computing and Data Science, CDS 2020",2020,Conference,Zhu Y.,10.1109/CDS49703.2020.00083
HFACS-based FAHP implementation to identify critical factors influencing human error occurrence in nuclear plant control room,"Human factor is an inevitable element of safety-critical control room operations in nuclear power plants. Identifying human factors influencing operator error occurrence in such critical application is important to mitigate human errors. Conventional methods employed for human factor identification are often static, unable to deal with data and model uncertainty, and to consider independencies among failure modes. This study employs the integration of the soft computing technique, viz. fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), into the human factors analysis and classifying system (HFACS) framework to identify the critical human factors that contribute to human errors in the nuclear control room application. Integration of FAHP improves the HFACS framework by providing an analytical foundation and group decision-making ability in order to ensure quantitative assessment of nuclear accidents. The proposed model has two phases. The first phase is study of 18 human performance-related events that occurred in Indian nuclear power plants, utilizing HFACS to analyze and determine the human and organizational factors (HOFs) responsible for such events. Existing HFACS can only be used to detect a wide range of human factors. The proposed model further explores the underlying causes of such a wide range of factors. The hierarchy of HOFs identified as adverse mental states and organizational process factors that contributed most failures causing accident in the first phase provides inputs for the critical human factor identification to the second phase, which is a quantitative analysis using FAHP. In the second phase, more than 40 adverse mental state and organizational process factors are identified from literature survey and ten subfactors are screened and selected by human reliability assessment and control room operation experts. The study was conducted by administering a questionnaire that is comprised of the screened factors. Data have been collected from 88 senior reactor operators in an operating nuclear power plant. The critical factors contributing to human errors identified from FAHP are attention, perception and memory under cognitive factor and decision making, training and communications under organizational factor. The study results reveal that the implementation of HFACS-based FAHP methodology enabled in determining intrinsic human factors that contribute to nuclear power plant control room operator performance. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Cognitive and organizational factor; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Human factor analysis and classification system; Multicriteria decision making; Nuclear industry,Soft Computing,2020,Journal,Karthick M.; Robert T.P.; Kumar C.S.,10.1007/s00500-020-04961-1
Two-sided matching decision-making model with hesitant fuzzy preference information for configuring cloud manufacturing tasks and resources,"Owing to the complexity of socio-economic environments and the fuzziness of human cognition, information of cognitive preference provided by decision-making organizations composed of many experts is often hesitant and fuzzy. In consequence, for the sake of addressing the hesitance and fuzziness of preference information for the configuration of tasks and resources in cloud manufacturing, a decision-making model of a two-sided matching considering a bidirectional projection under preference information of hesitant fuzzy is put forward. Primarily, this paper describes the problem of two-sided matching and introduces the hesitant fuzzy set. Afterwards, according to preference information given by matching agents using the hesitant fuzzy element, the evaluation matrix is constructed. Meanwhile, the bidirectional projection technology and TOPSIS method are combined to calculate the closeness degree matrix. Further, by introducing the constraint of the stable matching, a decision-making model of a two-sided matching for maximizing the closeness degree of two-sided matching agents is constructed, and the optimal configuration results are obtained by the solving of the model. Subsequently, the illustrative case is provided to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the presented model in solving the configuration for cloud manufacturing tasks and resources. Also, the stability in the proposed configuration results is illustrated by making a sensitivity analysis. Further, the reliability in the given solving process is demonstrated through performing a comparative analysis, as well as the advantages in the proposed model is also discussed. It shows that this developed model can give stable configuration results and also provide a matching approach for different agents under an uncertain environment. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cloud manufacturing; Configuration of tasks and resources; Hesitant fuzzy preference information; Matching model; Two-sided matching,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,2020,Journal,Li B.; Yang Y.; Su J.; Liang Z.; Wang S.,10.1007/s10845-020-01552-7
How particle detector can aid visual inspection for defect detection of TFT-LCD manufacturing,"Traditional defect classification of TFT-LCD array processing leaned on human decision-maker in which visual inspection used to categorize defects and consequently identify the rout-causes of defects. In practice, the main sources of defects in the TFT-LCD array process are particles. Due to the huge size of the machinery and production tools in the TFT-LCD array process, the sensor allocation for particle detection plays a critical role in the inadequacy and quality of sensor data. Therefore, where the adequacy and efficiency of human performance depend on human factors, emotion, and level of attention, this study aims to design a semi-automatic defect detection and classification method based on information capture by particle detector sensors to reduce the cognitive load devaluation and proceed with the process of defect classification. © 2020 ACM.",particle detector; sensor allocation; TFT-LCD array process; visual defect classification,UbiComp/ISWC 2020 Adjunct - Proceedings of the 2020 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2020 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers,2020,Conference,Khakifirooz M.; Fathi M.,10.1145/3410530.3414596
Establishing a modified CREAM approach for reliability evaluation,"The human factors area is one of the core field of industrial safety. It is deeply recognized that human factors are the main cause of accidents and breakdowns in various industries. Physiological mental states of human operators, like fatigue or vigilance, are crucial for the evaluation of human operators reliability. However, the shortages of measurements of physiological mental states limit their application. So human reliability analysis (HRA) is developed and many techniques have been developed. Among these techniques, cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) is often applied and discussed. Due to the application limits of common performance conditions (CPCs) in original CREAM approach, it is advised to generate a new list of CPCs for the application domain if CREAM approach is applied to other domains. In this contribution, a new approach defining a situated and dynamical human reliability measure is established. The approach is based on the well-known CREAM approach, which is modified with respect to the use in dynamical context. The new list of CPCs, their levels and corresponding effects on human reliability are determined. A new index, human performance reliability score (HPRS), is proposed for the assessment of human operator reliability. Finally, the applicability and correctness of the newly established approach is verified by data analysis.  © 2020 IEEE.",CPCs; CREAM; human operators; human reliability analysis; physiological mental states; situated driving context,"Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems, ICHMS 2020",2020,Conference,He C.; Soffker D.,10.1109/ICHMS49158.2020.9209509
An analytical framework for assessing cognitive capacity and processing speed of operators in industry 4.0,"The fourth industrial revolution introduced a new paradigm in manufacturing systems. The digital network is at the basis of the smart manufacturing and the physical context is strictly related to the artificial intelligence. This new manufacturing context drastically changed the role of the operator since the increasing adoption of innovative devices in manufacturing process modified the work activities and the operator is employed in more cognitive than physical tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this paper consists in developing an analytical framework to assess the human cognitive capacity occupancy and the human processing time of correct information known as the quality performance. The analytical framework presented allows to assess the human mental workload imposed by the task and how the processing speed of correct information changes when quality performance varies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Design of robotic and additive manufacturing for cultural heritage,"Intuitive and sensitive interaction between robots and humans in the near future will be an integral part of our everyday life environment, to shape new ways of use and make art accessible to a wider audience. Users interact with robotic systems creating new forms of dialogue based on artificial emotions that provide constant feedback to the user through significant gestures and movements. Constantly potential of robotic technologies and additive manufacturing techniques are changing the fruition of cultural heritage through the use of innovative systems that actively involve the viewer in the educational and cognitive experience with strong sensory perceptions, in sensitive environments and interactive spaces. Through additive manufacturing, process and project procedures and paradigms change completely, proposing new design methods which differ from conventional ones.

What is knowledge in Industry 4.0?,"Industry 4.0 relevant systems (eg, cyber-physical systems, digital twins, and alike) need digitized knowledge to function. Before digitizing knowledge, a fundamental question arises: What is knowledge? In order to answer this question, this study first reviews the definitions of knowledge found in the extant literature of epistemology, engineering design, manufacturing, organization science, information science, and education science. Since the definitions reported so far are not succinct and suffer circularity, this study overcomes this by introducing a three-element-based definition of knowledge—a piece knowledge consists of three elements defined as claim, provenance, and inference. This results in four types of knowledge defined as definitional, deductive, inductive, and creative knowledge, and each type of knowledge is again divided into some categories. Some real-life scenarios relevant to engineering design and manufacturing are used to clarify the proposed knowledge types/categories; the relevant pieces of knowledge are represented by knowledge graphs (concept maps) for the sake of digitization. The myriad proximal and distal relationships between knowledge and other relevant entities (human/machine learning, logical inferences, experimental data, analytical results, creative thinking, and cognitive reflections) become succinct and transparent due to the proposed definition of knowledge. Consequently, this study establishes the fundamentals of developing sophisticated methods and tools for the advancement of Industry 4.0. © 2020 The Authors.

Review of the features of augmented reality application in the training of operators and maintenance staff,"An overview of the use of augmented reality technology used to improve the training efficiency of operators and service personnel in the industry is presented. When considering the issues of building augmented reality systems, it was noted that in addition to technological issues, it is also essential to pay increased attention to the social aspect, especially if it is intended to apply augmented reality technology in multiplayer mode. A common environment in the interaction of several participants can disrupt the sense of identity of users, as well as potentially threaten the feeling of personal space and the sensation of physical objects. It is necessary to take into account the cognitive load theory and the schematic theoretical model of concreteness fading. The advantage of using augmented reality is to reduce human errors and improve the quality of training. For the use of augmented reality in the absence of a reliable network connection and the availability of only short communication sessions, the use of special tickets is proposed.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2020,Conference,Byvaltsev S.V.,10.1088/1757-899X/966/1/012121
A multicriteria motion planning approach for combining smoothness and speed in collaborative assembly systems,"Human-robot interaction is an important aspect of Industry 4.0, and the extended use of robotics in industrial environments will not be possible without enabling them to safely interact with humans. This imposes relevant constraints in the qualitative characterization of the motions of robots when sharing their workspace with humans. In this paper, we address the trade-off between two such constraints, namely the smoothness, which is related to the cognitive stress that a person undergoes when interacting with a robot, and the speed, which is related to normative safety requirements. Given an execution time, such an approach will allow us to plan safe trajectories without neglecting cognitive ergonomics and production efficiency aspects. We first present the methodology able to express the balance between these qualities in the form of a composite objective function. Thanks to the variational formalism, we identify the related set of optimal trajectories with respect to the given criterion and give a suitable parametrization to them. Then, we are able to formulate the safety requirements in terms of a reparametrization of the motion. Finally, numerical and experimental results are provided. This allows the identification of the preferable sets of the possible motions that satisfy the operator's psychological well-being and the assembly process performance by complying with the safety requirements in terms of mechanical risk prevention. © 2020 by the authors.",Collaborative robotics; Motion planning; Safety; Trajectory optimization,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2020,Journal,Rojas R.A.; Wehrle E.; Vidoni R.,10.3390/app10155086
Predictive Maintenance for Injection Molding Machines Enabled by Cognitive Analytics for Industry 4.0,"The exploitation of big volumes of data in Industry 4.0 and the increasing development of cognitive systems strongly facilitate the realm of predictive maintenance for real-time decisions and early fault detection in manufacturing and production. Cognitive factories of Industry 4.0 aim to be flexible, adaptive, and reliable, in order to derive an efficient production scheme, handle unforeseen conditions, predict failures, and aid the decision makers. The nature of the data streams available in industrial sites and the lack of annotated reference data or expert labels create the challenge to design augmented and combined data analytics solutions. This paper introduces a cognitive analytics, self- and autonomous-learned system bearing predictive maintenance solutions for Industry 4.0. A complete methodology for real-time anomaly detection on industrial data and its application on injection molding machines are presented in this study. Ensemble prediction models are implemented on the top of supervised and unsupervised learners and build a compound prediction model of historical data utilizing different algorithms’ outputs to a common consensus. The generated models are deployed on a real-time monitoring system, detecting faults in real-time incoming data streams. The key strength of the proposed system is the cognitive mechanism which encompasses a real-time self-retraining functionality based on a novel double-oriented evaluation objective, a data-driven and a model-based one. The presented application aims to support maintenance activities from injection molding machines’ operators and demonstrate the advances that can be offered by exploiting artificial intelligence capabilities in Industry 4.0. © Copyright © 2020 Rousopoulou, Nizamis, Vafeiadis, Ioannidis and Tzovaras.",artificial intelligence in manufacturing; cognitive analytics; ensemble learning; Industry 4.0; injection molding; predictive maintenance,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,2020,Journal,Rousopoulou V.; Nizamis A.; Vafeiadis T.; Ioannidis D.; Tzovaras D.,10.3389/frai.2020.578152
A Framework to Assess Human Performance in Normal and Emergency Situations,"Human error is one of the primary reasons for accidents in complex industries like aviation, nuclear power plant management, and health care. Physical and cognitive workload, flawed information processing, and poor decision making are some of the reasons that make humans vulnerable to error and lead to failures and accidents. In many accidents and failures, oftentimes, vulnerabilities that are embedded in the system, in the form of design deficiencies and poor human factors, lead to latent or catastrophic failures, but the last link is a human operator who gets blamed or worse, injured. This paper introduces an early design human performance assessment framework to identify what type of digital prototyping methodologies are appropriate to detect the deviation of the operator's performance due to an emergency condition. Fire in a civilian aircraft cockpit was introduced as a performance shaping factor (PSF). Ergonomics performance was evaluated using two prototyping strategies: (1) a computational prototyping framework includes digital human modeling (DHM) and computer-aided design; and (2) a novel mixed prototyping framework includes motion capture, DHM, and virtual reality. Results showed that the mixed prototyping framework can simulate emergency scenarios with increased realism and also has the potential to incorporate subjective aspects of ergonomics outcomes, overcoming the underlying lack of design knowledge in conventional early design methodologies. © 2020 ASME.",,"ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part B: Mechanical Engineering",2020,Journal,Ahmed S.; Onan Demirel H.,10.1115/1.4044791
Deep learning-based smart task assistance in wearable augmented reality,"Wearable augmented reality (AR) smart glasses have been utilized in various applications such as training, maintenance, and collaboration. However, most previous research on wearable AR technology did not effectively supported situation-aware task assistance because of AR marker-based static visualization and registration. In this study, a smart and user-centric task assistance method is proposed, which combines deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to provide more effective visual guidance with less cognitive load. In particular, instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN and markerless AR are combined to overlay the 3D spatial mapping of an actual object onto its surrounding real environment. In addition, 3D spatial information with instance segmentation is used to provide 3D task guidance and navigation, which helps the user to more easily identify and understand physical objects while moving around in the physical environment. Furthermore, 2.5D or 3D replicas support the 3D annotation and collaboration between different workers without predefined 3D models. Therefore, the user can perform more realistic manufacturing tasks in dynamic environments. To verify the usability and usefulness of the proposed method, we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses by conducting two user studies: 1) matching a virtual object to a real object in a real environment, and 2) performing a realistic task, that is, the maintenance and inspection of a 3D printer. We also implemented several viable applications supporting task assistance using the proposed deep learning-based task assistance in wearable AR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",AR smart glasses; Deep learning-based task assistance; Smart task assistance; Wearable augmented reality,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2020,Journal,Park K.-B.; Kim M.; Choi S.H.; Lee J.Y.,10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101887
Adjusting optimal height of walker handles using experimental cognitive data and adaptive neuro-fuzzy classification,"Background: Walker is one of the most important devices to help people who need assistance to maintain balance or stability while walking. A walker is often used by people who deal with reduced muscle strength of the lower limbs or reduced range of motion in hip, knee or ankle. One of the things that should be considered when using walker is its handle's optimal height. This height could be different according to the physical parameters of each person's height, weight, gender and age and can significantly affect the level of assistance and ergonomic aspects of the device. Methods: In this article, the basis for manufacturing an intelligent walker is presented by proposing an algorithm for determining the optimal height of the handle according to the users' characteristics. To achieve this, an experimental test was first performed on 47 subjects. After performing this experimental test, the information about each person, as well as the level of satisfaction declared by the user for the specific height was recorded. Then an intelligent algorithm was generated by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier and trained accordingly. The input of the classifier is the user characteristics and the output is the optimal height. Results: The algorithm predicted the optimal height with 87% accuracy. The result of the test was to obtain an optimal height for the subjects tested. The results obtained from the classifier show that optimal height depends on factors such as gender, age, height and weight. Conclusion: In this method, in order to obtain the optimal height for each person, one of the main parameters was the degree of satisfaction of the individual, which was not taken into account in the previous studies in this field. In this intelligent algorithm, by entering information of an individual, his/her optimal height can be calculated. The proposed method can be utilized in improving intelligent walkers. © 2020 National Taiwan University.",Adaptive neuro-fuzzy; Classification; Cognitive; Walker,"Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications",2020,Journal,Barkan M.; Mosalanejad R.; Taghvaei S.; Jamali S.; Eghtesad M.; Haghpanah S.A.,10.4015/S1016237220500209
A new concept of digital twin supporting optimization and resilience of factories of the future,"In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. © 2020 by the authors.",Anomaly detection; Attack detection; Co-simulation; Cyber-physical system modeling; Cyber-Range; Cyber-resilience; Digital twin; Factory of the future; Human behavior modeling; Modeling and simulation; Process optimization,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2020,Journal,Bécue A.; Maia E.; Feeken L.; Borchers P.; Praça I.,10.3390/app10134482
Cognition Digital Twins for Personalized Information Systems of Smart Cities: Proof of Concept,"Amid the rapid development of information communication technologies (ICTs), residents of future smart cities are expected to be exposed to unprecedented amounts of real-Time information on a daily basis. The cognitive overload driven by an excess of complex information has become a potential issue. Nonetheless, standardized information systems are still widely used, despite individual differences in information intake. To set a foundation for the intelligent information systems of smart cities, this paper introduces methods and tools for a cognition-driven, personalized information system, which acknowledges individual differences in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in daily lives and at work. The proposed method includes the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate complex tasks paired with the digital twin modeling of workers' cognitive reactions to different information formats and contents in VR simulation. Collected data are then used to build a personal digital twins model of information-driven cognition, or Cog-DT. A human subject experiment was performed with a simulated industrial facility shutdown maintenance task as a proof of concept of Cog-DT. The latest neuroimaging technology and analysis methods were applied to model unique cognitive processes pertaining to information processing. Results indicate that cognitive activities driven by different information stimuli in the work context are distinguishable and modelable with Cog-DT methods and tools. This study is expected to contribute to digital twin literature by testing a human-centered, individual-level digital twin modeling method of cognitive activities. It also sets a preliminary foundation for developing personalized information systems for the smart cities of the future. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Cognitive overload; Digital twins; Neuroimaging; Personalized information system,Journal of Management in Engineering,2020,Journal,Du J.; Zhu Q.; Shi Y.; Wang Q.; Lin Y.; Zhao D.,10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000740
"The relationship between cognitive distortion, depressive symptoms, and social adaptation: A survey in Japan","Background: In the treatment of depression, improvements in both clinical symptoms and social adaptation are important. Previous studies have shown that cognitive distortion and depressive symptoms are mutually related, and that depressive symptoms and social adaptation are related to each other. However, it is unknown how these three factors interrelate. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between cognitive distortion, depressive symptoms, and social adaptation. Methods: The final analyzed sample consisted of 430 employees of a manufacturing company in Japan (74.2% male, 24.7% female, 1.2% unknown). Participants completed the Worker's Cognitive Distortion Scale (WCDS), Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), and Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS). The WCDS was further divided into two subscales: self-contained cognitive distortion (WCDS-S) and environment-dependent cognitive distortion (WCDS-E). We used a covariance structure analysis for the main analysis and examined the relationship between these three variables’ scores. Results: The results revealed that both the WCDS-S and WCDS-E affected social adaptation indirectly via depressive symptoms, and that the WCDS-S additionally affected social adaptation directly. It was further revealed that the WCDS-S exerted a greater effect on depressive symptoms than the WCDS-E. Limitations: The participants were healthy cases. As such, one must be cautious about applying the results of healthy cases to clinical cases. Conclusions: This study indicates that cognitive distortion affects social adaptation directly and that it is indirectly mediated by depressive symptoms. Thus, professionals are required to attempt to treat depressive symptoms and improve social adaptation by considering that interventions in cognitive distortion may be effective. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Cognitive distortion; Depressive symptom; Social adaptation,Journal of Affective Disorders,2020,Journal,Ota M.; Takeda S.; Pu S.; Matsumura H.; Araki T.; Hosoda N.; Yamamoto Y.; Sakakihara A.; Kaneko K.,10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.094

A passive robot controller aiding human coaching for kinematic behavior modifications,"Precise programming of robots for industrial tasks is inflexible to variations and time-consuming. Teaching a kinematic behavior by demonstration and encoding it with dynamical systems that are robust with respect to perturbations, is proposed in order to address this issue. Given a kinematic behavior encoded by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), this work proposes a passive control scheme for assisting kinesthetic modifications of the learned behavior in task variations. It employs the utilization of penetrable spherical Virtual Fixtures (VFs) around the DMP's virtual evolution that follows the teacher's motion. The controller enables the user to haptically ‘inspect’ the spatial properties of the learned behavior in SE(3) and significantly modify it at any required segment, while facilitating the following of already learned segments. A demonstration within the VFs could signify that the kinematic behavior is taught correctly and could lead to autonomous execution, with the DMP generating the newly learned reference commands. The proposed control scheme is theoretically proved to be passive and experimentally validated with a KUKA LWR4+ robot. Results are compared with the case of using a gravity compensated robot agnostic of the previously learned task. It is shown that the time duration of teaching and the user's cognitive load are reduced. © 2019",Kinesthetic teaching; Learning by demonstration; Phri; Virtual fixtures,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2020,Journal,Papageorgiou D.; Kastritsi T.; Doulgeri Z.,10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101824
Does Reducing Sedentarity With Standing Desks Hinder Cognitive Performance?,"Objective: The goal of this study was to determine if using a standing desk would affect the productivity of workers, based on the type of work they perform. Background: Standing desks are a promising new health intervention in the workplace, but users and employers often require more specific recommendations related to productivity, such as the type of work that is more suited for the standing desk. Method: Thirty-seven young and healthy adults performed eight cognitive tasks in a 2 × 2 × 2 within-subject design of the following independent variables: posture (sitting/standing), task difficulty (easy/hard), and input device (computer mouse/tactile screen) in a counterbalanced order. Results: Our results revealed that using a standing desk had no negative effect on performance or perception, but it did lead to increased brain activity in the alpha band for the parietal region (β = 0.186, p =.001). Conclusion: We conclude that users of standing desks can freely stand for any level of task difficulty for work that involves working memory. However, more research is needed to generalize these results to other types of cognitive abilities and prolonged use of standing desks. Application: Our results simplify recommendations for workers as they do not need to worry about the type of work they are performing when using a standing desk. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",anthropometry; attentional processes; biomechanics; cognition; displays and controls; dual task; gait; industrial/workplace ergonomics; macroergonomics and the environment; posture; tactile/haptic displays; task switching; time sharing; work physiology; working memory,Human Factors,2020,Journal,Labonté-LeMoyne E.; Jutras M.-A.; Léger P.-M.; Sénécal S.; Fredette M.; Begon M.; Mathieu M.-È.,10.1177/0018720819879310
Information-level real-time AR instruction: a novel dynamic assembly guidance information representation assisting human cognition,"In AR assembly, geometric level visualization (GLV) embeds nongeometric attributes as guidance information into the real world and realizes the integration of human intelligence and assembly process at the geometric level. The guidance information generated by GLV is geometric level AR instruction, which contains the product manufacturing information of the object to be assembled. Users need to convert geometric level AR instructions into understandable assembly relationships, so as to understand the assembly tasks to be performed, which greatly reduce the efficiency of users. In fact, users use different logical constraints to organize the corresponding assembly relationships. Logical constraints include fixed constraints and real-time constraints, which reflect the combination of human intelligence and assembly processes at the information level. Among them, fixed constraints are used to represent assembly relationships, and real-time constraints are used to represent hidden manual rules in assembly relationships. These rules are the key information to guide users to establish an assembly relationship. They are usually adaptive information generated by users after understanding the assembly relationship. Although we propose an information-level visualization method (ILV), which can transform fixed constraints into computer-generated graphics, neither GLV nor ILV can use AR instructions to express the manual rules behind assembly relationships. Therefore, we propose an information-level real-time visualization method (IRV), which transforms real-time constraints into computer-generated real-time graphics, called information level real-time AR instruction (IRAI). In a case study, we analyzed and compared the performance of participants under real-time AR instructions with different information levels. This research shows that a high cognitive level of IRAI can make individuals have better performance in work efficiency and cognitive efficiency. This paper mainly studies IRV at different cognitive levels. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Assembly; Augmented reality; Human cognition; Intelligence manufacturing; Visualization,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2020,Journal,Wang Z.; Bai X.; Zhang S.; He W.; Zhang X.; Yan Y.; Han D.,10.1007/s00170-020-05034-1
Detecting cognitive hacking in visual inspection with physiological measurements,"Cyber threats are targeting vulnerabilities of human workers performing tasks in manufacturing processes, including visual inspection to bias their decision-making, thereby sabotaging product quality. This article examines the use of priming as a form of “cognitive hacking” to adversely affect quality inspection decisions in manufacturing, and investigates physiological measurements as means to detect such intrusion. In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Additive manufacturing; Cognitive hacking; Cybersecurity; EEG; Eye-tracking; Inspection,Applied Ergonomics,2020,Journal,Huang W.; Chen X.; Jin R.; Lau N.,10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103022
Human-in-Cognition Manufacturing-Loop (HCML): Framework and technologies,"The wave of intelligent manufacturing has swept the world, and intelligent manufacturing has realized the interconnection of the physical world and the information world. With the deep integration of intelligent manufacturing, cognitive computing and cognitive science, the manufacturing industry presents a new manufacturing model, which is called cognitive manufacturing. Cognitive manufacturing, as the evolution stage of intelligent manufacturing, endows industrial manufacturing system with perception and judgment ability. In addition, it enables the machine to realize self-adaptation, self-organization and self-decision-making based on cognition, thus completing accurate execution. But the manufacturing system cannot be entirely controlled by machines without the involvement of human. Based on the new generation of intelligent manufacturing for human-information-physical system and human-computer synthetic-intelligent system. This paper compares and extends the relevant technical models of intelligent manufacturing and cognitive manufacturing. Furthermore, it presents a framework that integrates the cognitive ability of human and machine, putting forward a cognitive manufacturing system architecture of human-machine collaborative cognition, called Human-in-Cognition Manufacturing-Loop (HCML). Additionally, the connotation, key implementation technology and future development trend of the system are discussed in details, and the role of artificial intelligence in the system are introduced.

Life cycle engineering 4.0: A proposal to conceive manufacturing systems for industry 4.0 centred on the human factor (DfHFinI4.0),"Engineering 4.0 environments are characterised by the digitisation, virtualisation, and connectivity of products, processes, and facilities composed of reconfigurable and adaptive socio-technical cyber-physical manufacturing systems (SCMS), in which Operator 4.0 works in real time in VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) contexts and markets. This situation gives rise to the interest in developing a framework for the conception of SCMS that allows the integration of the human factor, management, training, and development of the competencies of Operator 4.0 as fundamental aspects of the aforementioned system. The present paper is focused on answering how to conceive the adaptive manufacturing systems of Industry 4.0 through the operation, growth, and development of human talent in VUCA contexts. With this objective, exploratory research is carried, out whose contribution is specified in a framework called Design for the Human Factor in Industry 4.0 (DfHFinI4.0). From among the conceptual frameworks employed therein, the connectivist paradigm, Ashby's law of requisite variety and Vigotsky's activity theory are taken into consideration, in order to enable the affective-cognitive and timeless integration of the human factor within the SCMS. DfHFinI4.0 can be integrated into the life cycle engineering of the enterprise reference architectures, thereby obtaining manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 focused on the human factor. The suggested framework is illustrated as a case study for the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) methodology, which transforms it into PERA 4.0. © 2020 by the authors.",Cyber-physical system (CPS); DfHFinI4.0; Key enabling technology (KET); Knowledge-and technology-intensive industry (KTI); Life cycle; Manufacturing; Operator 4.0; PERA 4.0; VUCA,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2020,Journal,de Miranda S.S.-F.; Aguayo-González F.; Salguero-Gómez J.; Ávila-Gutiérrez M.J.,10.3390/app10134442
CPSoSaware: Cross-layer cognitive optimization tools methods for the lifecycle support of dependable CPSoS,"Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) are large complex systems where physical elements interact with and are controlled by a large number of distributed and networked computing elements as well as human users. Their increasingly stringent demands on efficient use of resources, high service and product quality levels and, of course low cost and competitiveness on the world market introduce big challenges related to the design operation continuum of dependable connected CPSs. The CPSoSaware project aims at developing the models and software tools to allocate computational power/resources to the CPS end devices and autonomously determining what cyber-physical processes will be handled by the devices' heterogeneous components (CPUs, GPUs, FPGA fabric, software stacks). The project relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) support to strengthen reliability, fault tolerance and security at system level and also to lead to CPS designs that work in a decentralized way, collaboratively, in an equilibrium, by sharing tasks and data with minimal central intervention. The CPSoSaware system will interact with the human users/operators through extended reality visual and touchable interfaces increasing situational awareness. The CPSoSaware system will be evaluated: i) in the automotive sector, in mixed traffic environments with semi-autonomous connected vehicles and ii) in the manufacturing industry where inspection and repair scenarios are employed using collaborative robots. © 2020 IEEE.",Automotive; Computer Hardware and Architecture; CPS; Embedded Systems; Manufacturing; Monitoring and Control Systems; System of Systems,"Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI, ISVLSI",2020,Conference,Keramidas G.; Antonopoulos C.P.; Voros N.; Jaaskelainen P.; Cid M.C.; Zacharaki E.I.; Fournaris A.P.; Lalos A.,10.1109/ISVLSI49217.2020.00-12
Balancing of manual reconfigurable assembly systems with learning and forgetting effects,"Within the paradigm of Industry 4.0, digital reconfigurable manufacturing and assembly systems can rapidly adapt to dynamic market demand, modifying their capacity and functionality. In manual or hybrid reconfigurable assembly systems, the rapid and frequent variations in the performed tasks subject workers to a significant cognitive load, making relevant the learning-forgetting phenomenon. In fact, the operators carry out the assigned activities for a short time before a reconfiguration of the system takes place, assigning them tasks often different from those just performed. This paper aims at investigating how the tasks’ execution time varies for operators working along a reconfigurable assembly line, depending on the learning forgetting effect. We applied a Kottas-Lau algorithm, considering the expected execution times updated according to a learning-forgetting curve. A numerical example, considering with five successive reconfigurations, allows to analyse the expected execution time trend for each operator-task pair and the variation in costs obtained as the operators learning rate and the variability of the operations change.

A Variable-Fractional Order Admittance Controller for pHRI,"In today's automation driven manufacturing environments, emerging technologies like cobots (collaborative robots) and augmented reality interfaces can help integrating humans into the production workflow to benefit from their adaptability and cognitive skills. In such settings, humans are expected to work with robots side by side and physically interact with them. However, the trade-off between stability and transparency is a core challenge in the presence of physical human robot interaction (pHRI). While stability is of utmost importance for safety, transparency is required for fully exploiting the precision and ability of robots in handling labor intensive tasks. In this work, we propose a new variable admittance controller based on fractional order control to handle this trade-off more effectively. We compared the performance of fractional order variable admittance controller with a classical admittance controller with fixed parameters as a baseline and an integer order variable admittance controller during a realistic drilling task. Our comparisons indicate that the proposed controller led to a more transparent interaction compared to the other controllers without sacrificing the stability. We also demonstrate a use case for an augmented reality (AR) headset which can augment human sensory capabilities for reaching a certain drilling depth otherwise not possible without changing the role of the robot as the decision maker. © 2020 IEEE.",,Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation,2020,Conference,Sirintuna D.; Aydin Y.; Caldiran O.; Tokatli O.; Patoglu V.; Basdogan C.,10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197288
Conceptualization of Human Factors in Automated Driving by Work Domain Analysis,"The increasing automation of driving functionalities is one of the most important trends in the automotive industry. The trend is moving towards systems which allow the driver to be absent from the active driving task. During the process, on one hand, the human driver more and more relies upon the driving automation to perform the dynamic driving tasks. Therefore, the driver needs to trust the driving automation. On the other hand, even the high driving automation (e.g. SAE Level 4) can only performs its functionality within the specific operational design domain and the driving automation relies upon the human driver to handle events when the vehicle operates outside the domain. What's more, for the lower level driving automation, the driver still needs to assume some fallback responsibility, and may be required to react promptly when the driving automation even inside the operational design domain is inadequate to operate the vehicle. From above, it is obvious that the interactions between human driver and driving automation are becoming complicated and less transparent. Hazardous events may occur due to the human factors in these interactions. However, human beings are subject to the context in which they work, and their behaviors are not random. Thus, to identify these factors in the early design phase can benefit the design of automated driving system. This contribution proposes to use Work Domain Analysis to analyze human factors in automated driving. As the 1st dimension of Cognitive Work Analysis, an overarching analytic framework for human behavior constraints, Work Domain Analysis can identify potential problems in driver automation interaction in a proactive manner and thus can benefit the design of driving automation. © 2020 SAE International.

A Green Infrastructure for HCI and IT- A Review,E-WASTE and Techno-trash are becoming a major threat to the environment. The word 'GREEN' suggests us to develop technologies taking into account the impact on the environment. The reason we chose HCI and IT is to use the technology effectively and dispose it effectively. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) also referred to as Man Machine Interaction (MMI) is the interaction between the user and a computer system. It deals with the implementation of several other active systems to improve the interaction with humans. This subject was designed so that the machine would completely understand humans and hence produce effective results. The main aim of HCI is to satisfy humans with the respective system. Since the population is enormously increasing there is a subsequent increase in the usage of the computer systems. But the major question here is this increase a boon or a bane to nature. This can be due to the increase in the population leading to increase in the manufacturing of computers which results in increase in the usage of the metals used for making them. These metals can further contribute to global warming. E-waste and techno-trash (disposal of outdated computers) is another major issue. We can reduce some of these factors by implementing the techniques of Green Communication and Green IT which can give us an effective healthy user interface with a power friendly infrastructure. Green Communication can help us improve the energy efficiency of the system. It mainly concentrates on energy saving and as well as emission reduction in the communication protocol. The idea is the computer can interact with the server in a power friendly way. Green IT practices concentrate on reducing the usage of hazardous materials while manufacturing the next generation computers and usage of non-renewable energy resources and many more. The scope of this paper is to suggest an environmentally sustainable methodology which can be both user-friendly and as well power friendly. © 2020 IEEE.,Cognitive radio; Device to Device Communications (D2D); Green Communications; Green IT (green ICT); Human Computer Interaction (HCI); PID (Proportional Integral Derivative); QOC; RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector); Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN),"International Conference on Emerging Trends in Information Technology and Engineering, ic-ETITE 2020",2020,Conference,Vishrutha K.,10.1109/ic-ETITE47903.2020.4
Psychophysiological evaluation of seafarers to improve training in maritime virtual simulator,"Over the years, safety in maritime industries has been reinforced by many state-of-the-art technologies. However, the accident rate hasn't dropped significantly with the advanced technology onboard. The main cause of this phenomenon is human errors which drive researchers to study human factors in the maritime domain. One of the key factors that contribute to human performance is their mental states such as cognitive workload and stress. In this paper, we propose and implement an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based psychophysiological evaluation system to be used in maritime virtual simulators for monitoring, training and assessing the seafarers. The system includes an EEG processing part, visualization part, and an evaluation part. By using the processing part of the system, different brain states including cognitive workload and stress can be identified from the raw EEG data recorded during maritime exercises in the simulator. By using the visualization part, the identified brain states, raw EEG signals, and videos recorded during the maritime exercises can be synchronized and displayed together. By using the evaluation part of the system, an indicative recommendation on “pass”, “retrain”, or “fail” of the seafarers’ performance can be obtained based on the EEG-based cognitive workload and stress recognition. Detailed analysis of the demanding events in the maritime tasks is provided by the system for each seafarer that could be used to improve their training. A case study is presented using the proposed system. EEG data from 4 pilots were recorded when they were performing maritime tasks in the simulator. The data are processed and evaluated. The results show that one pilot gets a “pass” recommendation, one pilot gets a “retrain” recommendation, and the other two get “fail” results regarding their performance in the simulator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Assessment; Electroencephalogram; Human factors; Maritime simulator; Maritime training; Psychophysiological evaluation,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2020,Journal,Liu Y.; Lan Z.; Cui J.; Krishnan G.; Sourina O.; Konovessis D.; Ang H.E.; Mueller-Wittig W.,10.1016/j.aei.2020.101048
The Shape of a Vehicle Windshield Affects Reaction Time and Brain Activity During a Target Detection Task,"Background: Achieving clear visibility through a windshield is one of the crucial factors in manufacturing a safe and comfortable vehicle. The optic flow (OF) through the windshield has been reported to divert attention and could impair visibility. Although a growing number of behavioral and neuroimaging studies have assessed drivers’ attention in various driving scenarios, there is still little evidence of a relationship between OF, windshield shape, and driver’s attentional efficacy. The purpose of this research was to examine this relationship. Methods: First, we quantified the OF across the windshield in a simulated driving scenario with either of two types of the windshield (a tilted or vertical pillar) at different speeds (60 km/h or 160 km/h) and found more upward OF along the tilted pillar than along the vertical pillar. Therefore, we hypothesized that the predominance of upward OF around the windshield along a tilted pillar could distract a driver and that we could observe the corresponding neural activity. Magnetic resonance scans were then obtained while the subjects performed a visual detection task while watching the driving scene used in the OF analysis. The subjects were required to press a button as rapidly as possible when a target appeared at one of five positions (leftmost, left, center, right, and rightmost). Results: We found that the reaction time (RT) on exposure to a tilted pillar was longer than that on exposure to a vertical pillar in the leftmost and rightmost conditions. Furthermore, there was more brain activity in the precuneus when the pillar was tilted than when it was vertical in the rightmost condition near the pillar. In a separate analysis, activation in the precuneus was found to reflect relative changes in the amount of upward OF when the target was at the rightmost position. Conclusions: Overall, these observations suggest that activation in the precuneus may reflect extraneous cognitive load driven by upward OF along the pillar and could distract visual attention. The findings of this study highlight the value of a cognitive neuroscientific approach to research and development in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. © Copyright © 2020 Sasaoka, Machizawa, Okamoto, Iwase, Yoshida, Michida, Kishi, Chiba, Nishikawa, Yamawaki and Nouzawa.",attention; optic flow; precuneus; vehicle design; visibility,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,2020,Journal,Sasaoka T.; Machizawa M.G.; Okamoto Y.; Iwase K.; Yoshida T.; Michida N.; Kishi A.; Chiba M.; Nishikawa K.; Yamawaki S.; Nouzawa T.,10.3389/fnhum.2020.00183

We also present an attack mitigation system that uses a Reinforcement Learning driven Software Defined Network to process the alerts generated by the attack detection sysem, together with Quality of Service measurements, so as to re-route sensitive traffic away from compromised network paths using.

Ethical leadership and work engagement: A moderated mediation model,"Drawing on social cognitive theory, this study extends our understanding of the relationship between ethical leadership and employee work engagement, by exploring self-efficacy as an important mediating variable.

Dialogue enhanced extended reality: Interactive system for the operator 4.0,"The nature of industrial manufacturing processes and the continuous need to adapt production systems to new demands require tools to support workers during transitions to new processes. At the early stage of transitions, human error rate is often high and the impact in quality and production loss can be significant. Over the past years, eXtended Reality (XR) technologies (such as virtual, augmented, immersive, and mixed reality) have become a popular approach to enhance operators' capabilities in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The purpose of this research is to explore the usability of dialogue-based XR enhancement to ease the cognitive burden associated with manufacturing tasks, through the augmentation of linked multi-modal information available to support operators. The proposed Interactive XR architecture, using the Spoken Dialogue Systems' modular and user-centred architecture as a basis, was tested in two use case scenarios: the maintenance of a robotic gripper and as a shop-floor assistant for electric panel assembly. In both cases, we have confirmed a high user acceptance rate with an efficient knowledge communication and distribution even for operators without prior experience or with cognitive impairments, therefore demonstrating the suitability of the solution for assisting human workers in industrial manufacturing processes. The results endorse an initial validation of the Interactive XR architecture to achieve a multi-device and user-friendly experience to solve industrial processes, which is flexible enough to encompass multiple tasks. © 2020 by the authors.",Augmented reality; Dialogue systems; Extended reality; Human-machine interaction; Industrial voicebots; Industry 4.0; Operator 4.0,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2020,Journal,Serras M.; García-Sardiña L.; Simões B.; Álvarez H.; Arambarri J.,10.3390/app10113960
Ironies of Automation 4.0,"This paper revisits a truly classic publication: Bainbridge's Ironies of Automation (1983) - but it also aims to make the point that the insights gained many years ago are today becoming more important than ever. As we all know, it is due to technological advances that automation is leading to increasingly complex systems which considerably raises the impact of the potential effects. Bainbridge's insights originated from manufacturing processes, but they equally apply to process control in general and to vehicle control, e.g., airplanes, road vehicles or trains. This paper shows that comparable observations can be reported and suggests a human-centered approach to overcome the problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

Regaining sight of humanity on the roadway towards automation,"A primary goal of the auto industry is to revolutionize transportation with autonomous vehicles. Given the mammoth nature of such a target, success depends on a clearly defined balance between technological advances, machine learning algorithms, physical and network infrastructure, safety, standards and regulations, and end-user education. Unfortunately, technological advancement is outpacing the regulatory space and competition is driving deployment. Moreover, hope is being built around algorithms that are far from reaching human-like capacities on the road. Since human behaviors and idiosyncrasies and natural phenomena are not going anywhere anytime soon and so-called edge cases are the roadway norm, the industry stands at a historic crossroads. Why? Because human factors such as cognitive and behavioral insights into how we think, feel, act, plan, make decisions, and problem-solve have been ignored. Human cognitive intelligence is foundational to driving the industry's ambition forward. In this paper I discuss the role of the human in bridging the gaps between autonomous vehicle technology, design, implementation, and beyond. © 2020, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,2020,Conference,López-González M.,10.2352/ISSN.2470-1173.2020.16.AVM-088
It's time to bring human factors to primary care policy and practice,"Primary health care is a complex, highly personal, and non-linear process. Care is often sub-optimal and professional burnout is high. Interventions intended to improve the situation have largely failed. This is due to a lack of a deep understanding of primary health care. Human Factors approaches and methods will aid in understanding the cognitive, social and technical needs of these specialties, and in designing and testing proposed innovations. In 2012, Ben-Tzion Karsh, Ph.D., conceived a transdisciplinary conference to frame the opportunities for research human factors and industrial engineering in primary care. In 2013, this conference brought together experts in primary care and human factors to outline areas where human factors methods can be applied. The results of this expert consensus panel highlighted four major research areas: Cognitive and social needs, patient engagement, care of community, and integration of care. Work in these areas can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of innovations in Primary Care. We provide descriptions of these research areas, highlight examples and give suggestions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Health information technology; Human factors; Primary care,Applied Ergonomics,2020,Journal,Beasley J.W.; Holden R.J.; Ötleş E.; Green L.A.; Steege L.M.; Wetterneck T.B.,10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103077
Considerations for the development of a driver distraction safety rating system for new vehicles,"Drivers engage in a wide range of non-driving related tasks while driving that have potential to distract to them and compromise their safety. These include interactions with infotainment systems built into the vehicle by vehicle manufacturers. These systems enable the performance of communication, entertainment, navigation and internet browsing tasks. Performing these tasks can degrade driving performance and increase crash risk. Not all infotainment technologies in new vehicles are equal in terms of their potential to distract. This paper documents the findings of a study commissioned by the Victorian Department of Transport to determine the feasibility of developing a test protocol for rating the distraction potential of new vehicles entering the Australian market. A literature review, consultation with expert international researchers and industry representatives, and workshops, were conducted in order to determine those elements of the HMI design of infotainment systems that should be assessed, identify suitable candidate test methods for assessing the visual and cognitive load imposed on drivers when performing infotainment tasks, and derive options for a distraction rating system. In addition, safety/rating assessment program reviews and a cost-benefit analysis of introducing a distraction rating system were undertaken. Eight potential distraction test methods were discerned from the literature and consultation. It was concluded that the most suitable test protocol for a distraction rating system involves the use of an HMI design checklist in combination with measurement of the visual and cognitive load imposed on drivers when performing specific infotainment tasks, using the VOT and DRT, respectively. Eight options for introducing a distraction safety rating as a consumer or NCAP distraction rating are presented. Each option builds upon the previous, with the first option being the development of voluntary guidelines (where vehicle manufacturers work to these guidelines on a voluntary basis) to option eight, where NCAPs incorporate a distraction rating in the overall vehicle safety rating. The benefits of introducing a highly effective (best case) distraction rating system are estimated to result in a road crash saving of approximately AU$28 per ‘improved/low distraction’ vehicle per year. © 2020, Australasian College of Road Safety.

A Methodology to Assess the Human Factors Associated with Lunar Teleoperated Assembly Tasks,"Low-latency telerobotics can enable more intricate surface tasks on extraterrestrial planetary bodies than has ever been previously attempted. In order for humanity to create a sustainable lunar presence, well-developed collaboration between humans and robots is necessary to perform complex tasks. This paper presents a methodology to assess the human factors, situational awareness (SA) and cognitive load (CL), associated with teleoperated assembly tasks. Currently, telerobotic assembly on an extraterrestrial body has never been attempted, and a valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has not been developed. The Telerobotics Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder created the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation of a rover and a robotic arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment designed as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's task was to assemble a radio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two conditions, remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA). The goal of this experiment was to establish a methodology to accurately measure the operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated assembly tasks. A successful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL while operating locally. Performance metrics measured in this experiment showed greater SA and lower CL in the local environment, supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to completion of the assembly task when operating remotely. Subjective measurements of SA and CL did not align with the performance metrics. This brought into question the validity of the subjective assessments used in this experiment when applied to telerobotic assembly tasks. Results from this experiment will guide future work attempting to accurately quantify the human factors associated with telerobotic assembly. Once an accurate methodology has been developed, we will be able to measure how new variables affect an operator's SA and CL in order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of telerobotic assembly tasks. © 2020 IEEE.",,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2020,Conference,Kumar A.; Bell M.; Mellinkoff B.; Sandoval A.; Martin W.B.; Burns J.,10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172667
Adaptive assembly systems for enabling agile assembly - Empirical analysis focusing on cognitive worker assistance,"Hybrid assembly systems combine the advantages of automated assembly solutions with the cognitive abilities of humans to make assembly more flexible while efficient. Adaptive systems in this context enlarge the scope in which the division of tasks between human and machine can be varied. These systems are an enabling factor for agile assembly since highly situation-aware technologies allow quick reaction in volatile assembly situations. This research focuses on the main opportunities and implementation obstacles of adaptive assembly systems in industrial practice. The results of an empirical study, focusing on cognitive worker assistance, with 132 participants from manufacturing companies, are presented in this paper. Main findings show that the introduction of adaptive worker assistance solutions requires extensive modifications of IT infrastructure. Besides an increase in flexibility, an enlarged potential for the improvement of worker training processes is expected. © 2020 The Author(s).",Adaptive assembly; Adaptivity; Agile assembly; Empirical analysis; Flexibility; Hybrid assembly; Worker assistance,Procedia CIRP,2020,Conference,Burggräf P.; Dannapfel M.; Adlon T.; Föhlisch N.,10.1016/j.procir.2020.05.244
Multi sensors platform for stress monitoring of workers in smart manufacturing context,"In factories of the future, advanced automation systems (e.g., cobots, exoskeletons, cyber physical systems) will reduce the physical effort of workers and compensate their limitations as well as ensure more flexibility, agility, and competitiveness. However, the activities of the operator 4.0 will entail an increased share of complex cognitive tasks. Therefore, monitoring the mental load will be increasingly important to ensure work environments that promote healthy life and wellbeing for all at all ages. For this aim, this paper proposes a framework to analyze heart rate, galvanic skin response and electrooculogram signals in order to extract features able to detect an excessive stress or cognitive load. Two wearable devices are used: Empatica E4 wristband and J!NS MEME electrooculography glasses.

Operability Evaluation System and Comparison Experiment of Gesture Operation and Button Operation of Robot Manipulator,"Robot manipulators are now widely used in manufacturing industries. When programmed to perform required movements via a process called teaching, they can accomplish a wide variety of complex tasks. In conventional teaching processes, a teaching pendant (TP), which is a tethered controller with which the operator inputs specific movement commands, is used. However, such devices normally have so many buttons that operators often experience difficulty in programming operations intuitively, so the teaching process consumes significant amounts of time and effort. To solve this problem, intuitive operation methods in which human body motions (such as hand gestures) are used as input to the robot have been studied. However, no quantitative comparisons between those new gesture-based and conventional teaching methods have yet been made. With that point in mind, the present paper proposes a virtual space-based evaluation system in which operators control the position and orientation of a six-degree-of-freedom virtual robot hand in order to evaluate and compare TP- and gesture-based operation methods. The experimental results show that when compared to TP-based methods, gesture-based operation methods achieved higher evaluations in terms of time and psychological aspects. In addition, four types of gesture-based operating methods were proposed in order to consider different ways in which position changes and orientation changes could be handled. The operability levels of the four gesture types were also compared quantitatively using the proposed evaluation system, and the obtained experimental results suggest that such differences can affect the cognitive burden imposed on the operator. © 2013 IEEE.",hand gestures; Operability; position and orientation; teaching pendant; virtual space,IEEE Access,2020,Journal,Komori M.; Terakawa T.; Yasuda I.,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970761
"Virtual and augmented reality effects on K-12, higher and tertiary education students’ twenty-first century skills","The purpose of this review article is to present state-of-the-art approaches and examples of virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems, applications and experiences which improve student learning and the generalization of skills to the real world. Thus, we provide a brief, representative and non-exhaustive review of the current research studies, in order to examine the effects, as well as the impact of VR/AR technologies on K-12, higher and tertiary education students’ twenty-first century skills and their overall learning. According to the literature, there are promising results indicating that VR/AR environments improve learning outcomes and present numerous advantages of investing time and financial resources in K-12, higher and tertiary educational settings. Technological tools such as VR/AR improve digital-age literacy, creative thinking, communication, collaboration and problem solving ability, which constitute the so-called twenty-first century skills, necessary to transform information rather than just receive it. VR/AR enhances traditional curricula in order to enable diverse learning needs of students. Research and development relative to VR/AR technology is focused on a whole ecosystem around smart phones, including applications and educational content, games and social networks, creating immersive three-dimensional spatial experiences addressing new ways of human–computer interaction. Raising the level of engagement, promoting self-learning, enabling multi-sensory learning, enhancing spatial ability, confidence and enjoyment, promoting student-centered technology, combination of virtual and real objects in a real setting and decreasing cognitive load are some of the pedagogical advantages discussed. Additionally, implications of a growing VR/AR industry investment in educational sector are provided. It can be concluded that despite the fact that there are various barriers and challenges in front of the adoption of virtual reality on educational practices, VR/AR applications provide an effective tool to enhance learning and memory, as they provide immersed multimodal environments enriched by multiple sensory features. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Higher education; K-12; Tertiary education; Twenty-first century skills; Virtual and augmented reality,Virtual Reality,2019,Journal,Papanastasiou G.; Drigas A.; Skianis C.; Lytras M.; Papanastasiou E.,10.1007/s10055-018-0363-2
Heart rate variability based assessment of cognitive workload in smart operators,"The study on cognitive workload is a field of research of high interest in the digital society. The implementation of 'Industry 4.0' paradigm asks the smart operators in the digital factory to accomplish more 'cognitive-oriented' than 'physical-oriented' tasks. The Authors propose an analytical model in the information theory framework to estimate the cognitive workload of operators. In the model, subjective and physiological measures are adopted to measure the work load. The former refers to NASA-TLX test expressing subjective perceived work load. The latter adopts Heart Rate Variability (HRV) of individuals as an objective indirect measure of the work load. Subjective and physiological measures have been obtained by experiments on a sample subjects. Subjects were asked to accomplish standardized tasks with different cognitive loads according to the 'n-back' test procedure defined in literature. Results obtained showed potentialities and limits of the analytical model proposed as well as of the experimental subjective and physiological measures adopted. Research findings pave the way for future developments. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Complementing Speech Interaction Design with Touch for Multi-Robot Systems,"There has been increasing demand in using multiple robots with human intervention for higher robustness in sectors like agriculture, clinical applications, environment surveillance, military operations, security. The benefits of using multiple robots include increased speed of missions largely due to ability to do parallel tasks and redundancy due to being able to replace a robot with another. However, at the same time, multiple robots substantially increase amount of information exchange with their operator. Therefore, designing interactions between human and multiple robots to achieve their effective cooperation has been a difficult research issue. In this paper, we propose an intuitive complementary user-interface design using speech and touch to control multiple robots simultaneously for a mission. This is achieved using a list of touch complement speech guidelines. We tested the system with six subjects who operated one, two and three robots in a simulation environment built using Unity. The mean performance score for various tasks and perceived cognitive load for each experiment iteration measured using the NASA-TLX questionnaire is then shown to illustrate the benefits of touch complement speech. © 2019 IEEE.",Complementary User Interface; Multimodal Interface; Voice User Interface,"IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON",2019,Conference,Johari K.; Karumpulli N.; Tan U.-X.,10.1109/TENCON.2019.8929506
Non-contact-based driver's cognitive load classification using physiological and vehicular parameters,"Classification of cognitive load for vehicular drivers is a complex task due to underlying challenges of the dynamic driving environment. Many previous works have shown that physiological sensor signals or vehicular data could be a reliable source to quantify cognitive load. However, in driving situations, one of the biggest challenges is to use a sensor source that can provide accurate information without interrupting diverging tasks. In this paper, instead of traditional wire-based sensors, non-contact camera and vehicle data are used that have no physical contact with the driver and do not interrupt driving. Here, four machine learning algorithms, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and neural networks (NN), are investigated to classify the cognitive load using the collected data from a driving simulator study. In this paper, physiological parameters are extracted from facial video images, and vehicular parameters are collected from controller area networks (CAN). The data collection was performed in close collaboration with industrial partners in two separate studies, in which study-1 was designed with a 1-back task and study-2 was designed with both 1-back and 2-back task. The goal of the experiment is to investigate how accurately the machine learning algorithms can classify drivers’ cognitive load based on the extracted features in complex dynamic driving environments. According to the results, for the physiological parameters extracted from the facial videos, the LR model with logistic function outperforms the other three classification methods. Here, in study-1, the achieved average accuracy for the LR classifier is 94% and in study-2 the average accuracy is 82%. In addition, the classification accuracy for the collected physiological parameters was compared with reference wire-sensor signals. It is observed that the classification accuracies between the sensor and the camera are very similar; however, better accuracy is achieved with the camera data due to having lower artefacts than the sensor data. © 2019 The Author(s)",Classification; Cognitive load; Decision tree; Logistic regression; Non-contact; Physiological parameters; Support vector machine; Vehicular parameters,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,2020,Journal,Rahman H.; Ahmed M.U.; Barua S.; Begum S.,10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101634
Enabling green manufacturing using Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) technology,"This paper presents how to model and implement green planning approaches in manufacturing environments using Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) technology. The paper takes a starting point in a case study aiming to bring forward environmental impacts as a decision factor in production planning and control by enabling companies to pick a plan where environmental impact factors are integrated in the planning environment. The companies involved in the project are two Danish process industries and manufacturer of mass customized products. Based on extensive data collection and developed simulation models, new methods of optimizing resources in the manufacturing are tested including factors such as machine allocation, batch sizes, sequences, and product mix. The tree main factors in assessing the environmental impact have been waste, energy, and emission. The latter has been calculated based on energy consumption and the type of energy source. Especially the need to involve human decision making to obtain a satisfactory plan, points towards Cogninive Infocommunication, mainly due to the complex nature of the production and supply chain planning that have proven difficult to model.x. © 2019 IEEE.",Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) Energy; Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) Energy; Cognitive Infocommunication; Cognitive Infocommunication; Emission; Emission; Green; Green; Manufacturing Planning and Control.; Manufacturing Planning and Control.; Simulation; Simulation; Sustainability; Sustainability; Waste; Waste,"10th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications, CogInfoCom 2019 - Proceedings",2019,Conference,Steger-Jensen K.; Hvolby H.-H.; Dukovska-Popovska I.; Vestergaard S.; Svensson C.,10.1109/CogInfoCom47531.2019.9089996
"A Semantic Workbench for Editing, Querying, Navigating and Distributing Ontologies for Cognitive Manufacturing","Manufacturing-oriented enterprises are investing in novel solutions to adapt their cyber and physical resources to the fast and, yet, unexpected changes of global industrial environment. One of the important trends is to work towards development of cognitive systems which are capable to process and analyze complex data using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools and techniques. Therefore, cognition can be already viewed as a requirement for hyper-connected environments e.g., the factories of the future or the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, there is a need to represent and store the data collected from machines in a format that can be understood and manipulated by both humans and machines. This is feasible by designing and implementing semantic models i.e., ontologies which, in turn, enable inferring implicit data of explicit knowledge, leading to cognition. Moreover, there is a need of granting the access to such information remotely and at system runtime. Within this conceptual article, the authors present a semantic workbench that was developed during a European project aiming at utilization of ontologies for knowledge representation and reasoning in industrial automation systems. Further, this research work proposes the encapsulation of semantic workbench as a service in order to be deployed in cloud-based platforms, hence, enabling remote access of authorized clients at system runtime. The proposed functionalities are also of critical importance in highly complex and distributed environments, like the IoT or industrial ecosystems. © 2019 IEEE.",cloud-based systems; Cognitive manufacturing; industrial internet; knowledge representation; ontology,IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference),2019,Conference,Ferrer B.R.; Mohammed W.M.; Lastra J.L.M.; Strzelczak S.,10.1109/IECON.2019.8927430
Two-sided matching model for complex product manufacturing tasks based on dual hesitant fuzzy preference information,"Due to the increasing complexity in socioeconomic environments and the fuzziness in human cognition, the cognitive information over alternatives provided by a decision organization consisting of several experts is usually uncertain and hesitant. Consequently, in order to solve the fuzziness and uncertainty of preference information in the matching process of complex product manufacturing tasks on the cloud manufacturing platform, a novel two-sided matching model based on dual hesitant fuzzy preference information is proposed. Firstly, the two-sided matching problem and the dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) are described. Then, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is constructed and normalized according to the preference information provided by agents on both sides. Sequentially, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is transformed into the satisfaction degree matrix by the projection technology. Simultaneously, considering the stable matching constraint, a multi-objective two-sided matching optimization model which maximizes the satisfaction degree and minimizes the difference degree of two-sided agents is established. Further, the matching relative competition degree is used to convert the multi-objective optimization model into a single-objective optimization model, and the matching algorithm is designed for solving the model. Moreover, an illustrative example is employed to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the developed model. Subsequently, the sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the stability of the proposed matching results, and the comparative analysis is carried out to illustrate the reliability of the proposed matching algorithm and the merits of the developed model. It reveals that the proposed model can not only obtain stable matching results but also give more choices in matching methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Complex products; Dual hesitant fuzzy preference; Matching optimization model; Satisfaction degree; Two-sided matching,Knowledge-Based Systems,2019,Journal,Li B.; Yang Y.; Su J.; Zhang N.; Wang S.,10.1016/j.knosys.2019.104989
Human performance in manufacturing tasks: Optimization and assessment of required workload and capabilities,"This paper discusses some examples where human performance and or human error prediction was achieved by using a modified version of the Rasch model(1980), where the probability of a specified outcome is modelled as a logistic function of the difference between the person capacity and item difficulty. The model needs to be modified to take into account an outcome that may not be dichotomous and o take into account the interaction between two macro factors: (a) Task complexity: that summarises all factors contributing to physical and mental workload requirements for execution of a given operative task & (b) Human capability: that considered the skills, training and experience of the people facing the tasks, representing a synthesis of their physical and cognitive abilities to verify whether or not they are matching the task requirements. Task complexity can be evaluated as a mathematical construct considering the compound effects of Mental Workload Demands and Physical Workload Demands associated to an operator task. Similarly, operator capability can be estimated on the basis of the operators' set of cognitive capabilities and physical conditions. The examples chosen for the application of the model were quite different: one is a set of assembly workstation in large computer manufacturing company and the other a set of workstation in the automotive sector.

A hybrid decision-making approach based on FCM and MOORA for occupational health and safety risk analysis,"Introduction: With the development of industries and increased diversity of their associated hazards, the importance of identifying these hazards and controlling the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) risks has also dramatically augmented. Currently, there is a serious need for a risk management system to identify and prioritize risks with the aim of providing corrective/preventive measures to minimize the negative consequences of OHS risks. In fact, this system can help the protection of employees’ health and reduction of organizational costs. Method: The present study proposes a hybrid decision-making approach based on the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), and Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) for assessing and prioritizing OHS risks. After identifying the risks and determining the values of the risk assessment criteria via the FMEA technique, the attempt is made to determine the weights of criteria based on their causal relationships through FCM and the hybrid learning algorithm. Then, the risk prioritization is carried out using the MOORA method based on the decision matrix (the output of the FMEA) and the weights of the criteria (the output of the FCM). Results: The results from the implementation of the proposed approach in a manufacturing company reveal that the score at issue can overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional Risk Priority Number (RPN) in the conventional FMEA, including lack of assignment the different relative importance to the assessment criteria, inability to take into account other important management criteria, lack of consideration of causal relationships among criteria, and high dependence of the prioritization on the experts’ opinions, which finally provides a full and distinct risk prioritization. © 2019 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd",Failure mode and effect analysis; Fuzzy cognitive map; Multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis; Occupational health and safety; Risk assessment,Journal of Safety Research,2019,Journal,Dabbagh R.; Yousefi S.,10.1016/j.jsr.2019.09.021
A Research of Electrical Engineering and Automation-based Intelligent Technology Application,"As a safety-security field, the transportation field always encourages and embraces advanced intelligent technologies to reduce risks. Recently, automated driving has received extensive attention from researchers and industries, as it is expected to improve the flow of traffic, to significantly reduce drivers' errors and thusly increase safety. Though many efforts have put on automated driving, many challenges remain in achieving fully autonomous, resulting in partially automated driving. The role of drivers in a partially automated car is monitoring and taking over driving in specific conditions, which is significantly different from the manual cars. The novel role of drivers induces new human factors issues and challenges to maintain traffic safety. This study tries to investigate these human factors issues involved in the human and automated driving interactions and to propose a framework of electrical engineering and automation-based intelligent technology application to mitigate risks. Specifically, trust, attention, situational awareness, and alarm fatigue were identified as significant human factors issues in automated driving. An electrical engineering and automation-based intelligent framework for monitoring cognitive states and generate warnings was proposed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2019,Conference,Wei Z.; Li Z.; Liang Y.; Huang X.; Yu L.; Sheng H.; Fan L.,10.1088/1757-899X/688/4/044041
Cognitive benefits of human-robot collaboration in complex industrial operations: A virtual reality experiment,"As a hallmark of Industry 4.0, collaborative robots (cobots) have been applied in various established industries such as manufacturing. In the construction industry, there is a growing interest and expectation regarding the use of cobots to improve productivity and safety. Although evidence from other industrial applications supports the benefits of cobots in performance improvement, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, let alone the evaluation and validation in construction operations. In this study, we hypothesize that the presence of cobots releases construction workers from less productive motor actions and enables workers to focus on work planning activities, which is more closely related to productivity. To test the hypothesis, we implemented a prototype of human-robot collaboration for a valve manipulation task that is commonly seen in industrial facility turnaround shutdown. A virtual reality (VR) model was created as the experiment platform, where participants (n=20) were asked to operate 24 valves in a given sequence according to the provided instructional information. The efficiency and task performance of test subjects were examined to quantify the benefits of robotic assistance, which was measured with an eye tracker. The results indicate that with the physical assistance of cobots, task performance was improved, and the user cognitive patterns were more preferred as they could allocate more neural resources and attention time on activity planning instead of repetitive motor actions. The findings are expected to set a foundation for better visibility, enhanced responsiveness, and better collaboration in the labor-intensive industry. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Construction Research Congress 2020: Infrastructure Systems and Sustainability - Selected Papers from the Construction Research Congress 2020,2020,Conference,Zhu Q.; Wei P.; Shi Y.; Du J.,10.1061/9780784482858.015
Study of the impact of projection-based assistance systems for improving the learning curve in assembly processes,"With the introduction of Industry 4.0 the use of worker assistance systems is getting more and more important.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of a projection-based worker assistance system conducting lab experiments simulating a ramp-up situation of a new product in assembly. The specific aim is the investigation of the impact of such systems in assembly for improving the learning curve, when products are changing. The study shows the results of a comparison between the assembly process with traditional worker instructions and the use of cognitive assistance systems to project instructions on the workplace. © 2020 The Authors.",Assembly system; Assistance system; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing system; Smart manufacturing; SME,Procedia CIRP,2020,Conference,Mark B.G.; Rauch E.; Matt D.T.,10.1016/j.procir.2020.05.018
Cognitive human modeling in collaborative robotics,"In today's INDUSTRY 4.0 context, the growing need to improve performances and sustainability of working environment is looking forward to developing interoperable and service-oriented systems with real time capabilities. This is boosting the installation of decentralized and reliable robotics cells with flexible cooperative capabilities. They enroll smart operators'flexibility and robot productivity in collaborative robotics (properly cobots) applications. This paper consists of a state-of-the-art review on cognitive load in manufacturing with characterization of human-robot collaboration. A simulated analysis of a collaborative working cell is performed. An Agent Based (AB) model is presented with application in the automotive sector. The cell consists of logistics AGVs equipped with a manipulator. They interact with working robots and human operator. Robots collaborate in cell and they cooperate with operator on assisted task using Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). The load of human in the collaborative work-cell- set on state of art - is measured according with Functional states over different Behavioral Structures (FBS). We quantified the load of cognitive factors while reporting interaction analysis. Some factors as age and interface complexity and recovery strategy are investigated while reporting their effect on a dynamic variable, i.e., physical stress properly fatigue.

Combining safety and speed in collaborative assembly systems - An approach to time optimal trajectories for collaborative robots,"Human-robot interaction is a key enabling technology of Industry 4.0 and the prospected pervasiveness of robotics in industrial environments will be not possible without enabling them to safety interact with humans. Such a fact imposes a relevant constraints because the limits imposed by the actual technical deliverables entail strong requirements in the operational velocity of robots when sharing their workspace with humans. In this paper, we address the theoretical limits of velocity under the light of current state-of-the-art trajectory planning and normative requirements. The main goal is to find a methodology to plan safe trajectories without neglecting cognitive ergonomics and production efficiency aspects. We start by considering the set of trajectories which are optimal with respect to a cognitive criteria and give a suitable parametrization to it. Then we are able to formulate the safety requirements in terms of constraints in an optimization problem. Finally, experimental results are provided. This allow the identification of the preferable sets of possible motions which satisfy the operator psychological wellbeing and the assembly process performance by complying the safety requirements in terms of mechanical risk prevention. © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

Relationships among dimensions of human factors climate in construction,"Independently, work preferences have been studied for many years across a variety of disciplines and industries. However, the correlation among these attributes in the construction industry has not been examined. These relationships would help to understand if dimensions of human factors like emotions, fatigue, safety, cognitive demand, job satisfaction, and motivation act independently and discretely, or systematically to improve performance. This paper introduces the concept of human factors (HF) climate for the first time and explores the theoretical relationships among potential dimensions. The HF climate can be defined as the holistic method for studying the perceived psychological, physiological, and emotional impacts of work on human resources. Literature has revealed that most studies examine individual human factors independently and only a few pairwise relationships have been explored. To date, there is no study to examine human factors as a system or climate, although most studies use perception-based surveys and acknowledge that different aspects of human factors do not act in isolation. The goal of the HF climate is to replace the study of one or two dimensions (e.g., safety) at a time and allow us to consider the interrelationships among multiple dimensions simultaneously. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Construction Research Congress 2020: Safety, Workforce, and Education - Selected Papers from the Construction Research Congress 2020",2020,Conference,Welfare K.S.; Hallowell M.R.,10.1061/9780784482872.032
Supervised stowing as enabling technology for the integration of impaired operators in the industry,"Nowadays, the number of jobs accessible to impaired people in industries is limited. However, minimum changes in the plant could allow the employment of such individuals. Technology is the way to assist such workers to perform at the best they could and to avoid disabilities to limit their potentialities. This work proposes a supervised stowing system that will allow impaired operators to perform the task of order-picking in cluttered environments, despite their disabilities. Pick and place is the most repetitive and common task in industrial manufacturing and warehouses, requiring complex cognitive skills for robots. In the proposed system, the task is physically executed by a robot, while the mental process of selecting the correct object to pick is demanded to the operator. This action is performed through an easy to use graphical user interface.

Individual differences in describing levels of automation,"Level of automation (LoA) is increasingly recognized as an important principle in improving manufacturing strategies. However, many automation decisions are made without formally assessing LoA and can be made based on a host of organizational factors, like varied mental models used by managers in decisionmaking. In this study, respondents (N = 186) were asked to watch five different assembly tasks being completed in an automotive manufacturing environment, and then identify ""how automated"" or ""how manual"" they perceived the task to be. Responses were given using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and sliding scale, where possible responses ranged from 0 (totally manual) to 100 (totally automated). The activity explored how and when individuals recognized the automated technologies being employed in each task. The tasks of the videos varied primarily by whether the human played active or passive role in the process. Focus group comments collected as a part of the study show how rating patterns revealed functional systemslevel thinking and a focus on cognitive automation in manufacturing. While the video ratings generally followed the LoA framework discussed, slight departures in the rating of each video were found. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Time-Series Data Classification and Analysis Associated with Machine Learning Algorithms for Cognitive Perception and Phenomenon,"Analysis and collection of time-series data as a major role of machine learning has been emphasized with an important key in cognitive science. Because the cognitive mechanisms such as human sensation and perception from cognitive science are fast responses ranging from a few milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, the method of pattern recognition and analysis of these brain signals must be done and it is necessary to derive some information. In this paper, we investigated time-series data of cognitive function of the brain obtained using a non-invasive technique on multiple channels via signal classification and analysis, using a cognitive science approach and experiments. The test dataset was collected in 19 channels using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques with multiple rests and working conditions on eight subjects. From this perspective, the main contributions of this paper are that it completes the collection and analysis of cognitive-scientific time-series data and has scientific implications that extend to other integrated domains, energy, manufacturing, bioinformatics, and finance area. The use of Shapelet and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) classification techniques on brain signal time-series shows the potential to identify neuro-biological phenomena that can proactively signal a disease or disorder.

Factors affecting accuracy in the quality control checking of fresh produce labels: A situational and laboratory-based exploration,"Manufacturing industries often rely on quality control staff to ensure mistakes are detected before products are shipped to customers. Undetected errors can result in large financial and environmental costs to packaging companies and supermarkets but the contributors to such error are underexplored. The research reported in this paper investigated human error in the quality control checking of information displayed on the labels which accompany packaged fresh produce. Initial work sought to understand the demands of label-checking in the packhouse environment, through interviews with key quality control staff, in situ observations, and the study of historical error data held by a fresh produce packaging company. This study highlighted the dynamic and cognitively challenging environment in which label-checking occurred, while the historical error data indicated both the scale of the packhouse's work and the infrequency of error occurring. In a separate strand of laboratory-based research, experienced and novice label-checkers were presented with a simulated label-checking task and a battery of computerized and pen-and-paper tests. These tasks were administered to determine whether cognitive abilities could predict label-checking accuracy in a controlled laboratory environment. Stronger abilities in two cognitive processes (information processing speed and inhibition) predicted greater overall accuracy and higher detection of labeling errors. In identifying potential contributors to human error in the quality control checking of product labels both in situ and in the laboratory, the results are relevant to manufacturing, wherever information is printed on labels, especially when labeling processes depend upon human data entry and human quality control checking. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",cognition; human error; individual differences; quality control; visual inspection,Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing,2019,Journal,Smith-Spark J.H.; Katz H.B.; Wilcockson T.D.W.; Marchant A.P.,10.1002/hfm.20806
Modulating Human Input for Shared Autonomy in Dynamic Environments,"Many robotic tasks require human interaction through teleoperation to achieve high performance. However, in industrial applications these methods often require high levels of concentration and manual dexterity leading to high cognitive loads and dangerous working conditions. Shared autonomy attempts to address these issues by blending human and autonomous reasoning, relieving the burden of precise motor control, tracking, and localization. In this paper we propose an optimization-based representation for shared autonomy in dynamic environments. We ensure real-time tractability by modulating the human input with the information of the changing environment in the same task space, instead of adding it to the optimization cost or constraints. We illustrate the method with two real world applications: grasping objects in a cluttered environment, and a spraying task requiring sprayed linings with greater homogeneity. Finally we use a 7 degree of freedom KUKA LWR arm to simulate the grasping and spraying experiments. © 2019 IEEE.",,"2019 28th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2019",2019,Conference,Mower C.E.; Moura J.; Davies A.; Vijayakumar S.,10.1109/RO-MAN46459.2019.8956304
Forming a cognitive automation strategy for Operator 4.0 in complex assembly,"Due to today's technological advances in the area of Industry 4.0, having a strategy for cognitive automation solutions is crucial. Operator 4.0, will have handle and manage different work tasks ranging from learning new tasks to solving difficult problems and initiate changes. To support the operator moving between these tasks a specific strategy for the design of cognitive automation solutions is needed. The suggested strategy has three steps: (1) select assembly modes, (2) choose level of cognitive automation carrier and (3) suggest cognitive automation content. It is important that the operator is part of the design and that the solution supports movement between the modes learning, operational and disruptive modes. The strategy could support manufacturing companies meeting challenges regarding social sustainability e.g. stress, attractive workplaces and demography changes as well as system transparency and complexity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Complexity; Ergonomics; Human factors; Human-automation interaction; Industry 4.0; Operator 4.0,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2020,Journal,Mattsson S.; Fast-Berglund Å.; Li D.; Thorvald P.,10.1016/j.cie.2018.08.011
Bio-intelligent selective laser melting system based on convolutional Neural networks for in-process fault identification,"This research work focuses on the development of a bio-intelligent additive manufacturing system based on Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology in the framework of the Biological Transformation in Manufacturing. With the objective to provide the SLM system with cognition, decision making and self-learning capabilities inspired by human intelligence and cognitive skills, a machine learning approach using convolutional neural networks for in-process fault identification based on automatic image processing is presented. An in-process sensor monitoring system based on a camera installed on the SLM machine tool is employed to acquire images of the scanned layers with the final aim to timely identify possible faults and realize an adaptive layer-by-layer control loop in which the process is self-adjusted based on learning. © 2020 The Authors.",Additive manufacturing; Bio-intelligence; Convolutional neural networks; Image processing; Machine learning; Selective laser melting,Procedia CIRP,2020,Conference,Angelone R.; Caggiano A.; Teti R.; Spierings A.; Staub A.; Wegener K.,10.1016/j.procir.2020.05.107
Cohort differences in cognitive aging: The role of perceived work environment,"Studies of historical and societal influences on cognitive aging generally document that later-born cohorts outperform earlier-born cohorts on tests of fluid cognitive performance. It is often noted how advances in educational attainment in childhood and adolescence may contribute to these historical improvements in cognitive aging. Less is known about the role of work environment in adulthood. Over the last century, work demands and characteristics have been changing profoundly, particularly with shifts from a manufacturing to a service and technical economy. In this article, we used data from the Seattle Longitudinal Study to compare age-related trajectories of cognitive change in five primary mental abilities between earlier-born (1901-1938) and later-born cohorts (1939-1966). Cohorts were matched on an observation-by-observation basis using age and retest, and analyses controlled for participants' gender and number of data points provided. We found that (a) later-born cohorts had higher levels of performance on most cognitive tasks and exhibited less age-related declines in word fluency; (b) later-born cohorts had more enriched perceived work environments, as indicated by higher levels of worker control and innovation, with no cohort differences in work autonomy; (c) these experiences were associated with higher levels of cognitive performance at age 55 years; (d) the effects of perceived work environment were independent of education; and (e) the effects of perceived work environment were consistent across cohorts. The findings suggest that perceived work environment is associated with cognitive functioning independently of education and invariably across historical time. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying these associations. © 2019 American Psychological Association.",Cognitive aging; Cognitive enrichment; Cohort; Perceived work environment,Psychology and Aging,2019,Journal,Hülür G.; Ram N.; Willis S.L.; Warner Schaie K.; Gerstorf D.,10.1037/pag0000355
Human-robot collaboration systems: Components and applications,"Collaborative robots (cobots) have emerged as a technological solution for enhanced manipulation of objects while allowing safe interaction with a human counterpart. Although substantial developments in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) systems have taken place in the last decade, no conceptual framework of their composition is available. The literature provides an unclear process of how to integrate human-robot interaction levels and their roles with safety and communication technologies into HRC systems. To design an ergonomic HRC system (in its physical and cognitive dimensions) a clear identification and categorization of its components is required. This paper presents a literature review analysis that identifies the tendencies of HRC in the manufacturing sector. An initial distinction between application by type of industry and task is carried out. Afterward, interaction levels in HRC systems are examined, both individually and collectively, depending on the application area. Work roles of humans and robots, safety settings, and communication interfaces are also analyzed as part of the interaction levels in the primary composition of HRC systems. Their presence and distribution along 50 selected cases are also explored. The analyzed data, results, and observations presented in this paper demonstrate clear tendencies for specific components that were identified as necessary for improving future designs of human-centered HRC systems. © 2020, Avestia Publishing.

Classification of Mental Workload (MWL) using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),"In the current era of technological advancements and rising human-machine interaction, urged the vital importance of human factors and ergonomics in an industrial collaborative environment. These ergonomic needs have made it essential to analyze the industrial cognitive processes like mental workload (MWL), stress and vigilance in the ecological environment. Conventionally Electroencephalography (EEG) was used for assessment of brain electrical activity but recently functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has immerged as a better substitute for acquiring brain signals with fewer protocols and enhanced spatial resolution. Over the period of time Machine learning algorithms (LDA, k-NN, ANN) are used to classify MWL and affiliated brain functions. Now the trend of employing Deep learning techniques is gaining popularity. In this study, we analyzed and classified MWL states using Machine learning (SVM) and Deep learning (CNN) algorithms. The classification accuracies achieved with Deep learning (CNN) outperformed the accuracies achieved with Machine learning algorithms. The best accuracies were achieved using CNN that are in the range of 80-87%. Finally, a comparison is drawn between Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms for better classification and discrimination of cognitive loads. © 2020 IEEE.",CNN; fNIRS; Mental workload; SVM,"2020 3rd International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Engineering Technologies: Idea to Innovation for Building the Knowledge Economy, iCoMET 2020",2020,Conference,Asgher U.; Khalil K.; Ayaz Y.; Ahmad R.; Khan M.J.,10.1109/iCoMET48670.2020.9073799

Prediction of Human Activity Patterns for Human-Robot Collaborative Assembly Tasks,"It is widely agreed that future manufacturing environments will be populated by humans and robots sharing the same workspace. However, the real collaboration can be sporadic, especially in the case of assembly tasks, which might involve autonomous operations to be executed by either the robot or the human worker. In this scenario, it might be beneficial to predict the actions of the human in order to control the robot both safely and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to predict human activity patterns in order to early infer when a specific collaborative operation will be requested by the human and to allow the robot to perform alternative autonomous tasks in the meanwhile. The prediction algorithm is based on higher-order Markov chains and is experimentally verified in a realistic scenario involving a dual-arm robot employed in a small part collaborative assembly task. © 2018 IEEE.",Cognitive human-robot interaction; intelligent and flexible manufacturing; planning; scheduling and coordination,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2019,Journal,Zanchettin A.M.; Casalino A.; Piroddi L.; Rocco P.,10.1109/TII.2018.2882741

Adapting virtual training systems for industrial procedures to the needs of older people,"Integration of older employees into the workforce is critical for a successful manufacturing industry due to demographic change. However, technological developments to create more flexible manufacturing environments are leading to increasingly complex machinery that has to be operated by an aging workforce. Virtual training systems prepare operators for the interaction with industrial machines. Current virtual training systems do not address the perceptive and cognitive abilities of older users to enable a satisfying and efficient training. This article develops adaptations of the visualization and the interaction techniques of a virtual training system to address the abilities of older operators. The results of a between-subjects study indicate that the adaptations improve the subjective perception of the training system and decrease the training time. The paper concludes that adaptive training systems can support the participation of diverse user groups in the manufacturing industry by providing more effective and satisfying training. © 2019 IEEE.",Demographic change; Manufacturing processes; Virtual training,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),2019,Conference,Loch F.; Bock S.; Zou M.; Vogel-Heuser B.,10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972247
Metacognitive learning approach for online tool condition monitoring,"As manufacturing processes become increasingly automated, so should tool condition monitoring (TCM) as it is impractical to have human workers monitor the state of the tools continuously. Tool condition is crucial to ensure the good quality of products—worn tools affect not only the surface quality but also the dimensional accuracy, which means higher reject rate of the products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify tool failures before it occurs on the fly. While various versions of intelligent tool condition monitoring have been proposed, most of them suffer from a cognitive nature of traditional machine learning algorithms. They focus on the how-to-learn process without paying attention to other two crucial issues—what-to-learn, and when-to-learn. The what-to-learn and the when-to-learn provide self-regulating mechanisms to select the training samples and to determine time instants to train a model. A novel TCM approach based on a psychologically plausible concept, namely the metacognitive scaffolding theory, is proposed and built upon a recently published algorithm—recurrent classifier (rClass). The learning process consists of three phases: what-to-learn, how-to-learn, when-to-learn and makes use of a generalized recurrent network structure as a cognitive component. Experimental studies with real-world manufacturing data streams were conducted where rClass demonstrated the highest accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity over its counterparts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Concept drifts; Evolving intelligent system; Lifelong learning; Nonstationary environments; Online learning; Prognostic health management,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,2019,Journal,Pratama M.; Dimla E.; Lai C.Y.; Lughofer E.,10.1007/s10845-017-1348-9
Concept and evaluation of a method for the integration of human factors into human-oriented work design in cyber-physical production systems,"Due to the shift from mainly manual labor to an increased portion of cognitive tasks in manufacturing caused by the introduction of cyber-physical systems, there is a need for an updated collection of adequate design principles for user interfaces between humans and machines. Thus, we developed a method for the determination and evaluation of such design principles. It is based on human factors methods and facilitates the assessment of specific work design elements which are supposed to have a significant effect on work performance and the perception of work in cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). Within the application of the developed method, we derived an overview of key design elements in CPPS, developed an experimental platform, and conducted two empirical studies with a total of n = 68 participants. This way, three design elements were investigated, and the findings transferred into preliminary design principles. We can state that the method can be used both for a better understanding of the mechanisms between human factors and work in CPPS. Besides, it helps to provide a catalogue of design principles applicable to SMEs to promote more efficient and successful integration of workers into CPPS. © 2019 by the authors.",Anthropocentric design; Cyber-physical production systems; Cyber-physical systems; Human factors; Human-machine interaction; Industry 4.0; Operator 4.0,Sustainability (Switzerland),2019,Journal,Stern H.; Becker T.,10.3390/su11164508
Towards Adaptive Switches through implementation of visual feedback in assistive devices,"Products aimed at individuals with disabiliy could not match user requirements under conditions imposed by the user. Also, frequent modifications and adaptation are required to increase the match between user requirements and prototypes. The importance to test different solutions and gain a knowledge base is an important aspect as the time in trials and experimentation is still a limit of personalized devices. An experimentation is conducted to test a solution of hardware interface for an Augmentative and Alternative Communication System which implements visual feedbacks and visual tutorial in training phase. In this study, visual feedbacks demonstrate an improvement of performances due to three main effects: reducing training time through an interactive tutorial, improving automatic behaviour and limiting cognitive load. The prototypes are realized using open-source electronic boards and Additive Manufacturing to realize the housing. A usability test is performed to calculate metrics and benchmark solutions with and without visual aids. Measures of Lostness and Keystroke Level Model estimates the effectiveness of software interface and interaction of users with hardware and software interfaces.Also, this study can lead to the definition of an adaptive switch that modify its status in order to eliminate redundant operations and ineffective actions.Visual feedback has proven some advantages in training user and Additive Manufacturing enabled the study and lead the way for devices that are adaptive on software interface and control and personalized in the hardware interface. © 2019 IEEE.",augmentative and alternative communication; biomedical devices; usability,"2019 IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Industry 4.0 and IoT, MetroInd 4.0 and IoT 2019 - Proceedings",2019,Conference,Cascone F.D.; Martorelli M.; Gloria A.; Nathan-Roberts D.; Lanzotti A.,10.1109/METROI4.2019.8792893
Ergonomic Evaluation of Body Postures in Order Picking Systems Using Motion Capturing,"Industry 4.0 is ushering in a new era of digitization, automation of machines and also provides autonomy in industrial processes. Despite these advances, the processes within order picking systems remain largely manual. Human cognitive and motor skills are difficult to replace and human flexibility is needed on the shop floor. It is well known that manual work requirements in intralogistics can lead to physical strain and in the long run to physical impairments such as musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of this article is to digitize the well-known ergonomics analysis tool Key Indicator Method (KIM) in order to obtain an automated evaluation and thus standardize the ergonomics assessment procedure in the future. For this purpose, a Motion Capture (MoCap) System will be used in a study where a manual picking process is simulated. With the help of this system, the course of a joint angle on the example of the spine during picking is analysed. The results are assessed on the basis of existing ergonomic standards and guidelines. At the same time, the KIM is performed by two ergonomics experts to validate the results of the MoCap system and to check the suitability of the system for ergonomic analysis. © 2019 IEEE.",body postures; ergonomics; Key Indicator Method; logistics; motion capturing; order picking,"Proceedings - 2019 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference, PHM-Paris 2019",2019,Conference,Feldmann F.; Seitz R.; Kretschmer V.; Bednorz N.; Ten Hompel M.,10.1109/PHM-Paris.2019.00041
Manufacturing-Uber: Intelligent operator assignment in a connected factory,"This paper introduces the Manufacturing-Uber concept for dynamic assignment of operators in the Connected Factory. In traditional non-IoT machining environments it is common to assign an operator to a (small) number of machines, clustered in close proximity within a cell. In contrast to “fixed” assignment within a cell, the Manufacturing-Uber approach leverages the connectivity of the IoT environment to allow on-demand “floating” operator assignment across cells. An intelligent assignment engine determines and assigns the operator to achieve best system performance. Results show that Manufacturing-Uber outperforms fixed assignment with respect to reduction in required operators, increased machine up-time and more parts completed. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Bioinspiration in Affective Motion Planning of an Anthropomorphic Robot for Affect-Based Human-Robot Collaborative Manufacturing,"Affect-based robot-human communication is a nonverbal communication method that can help the robot communicate its mental states to the collaborating human during human-robot collaborative manufacturing. Such communication can make the manufacturing situations (events) transparent to the human and also impact the cognitive abilities of the human. All these may impact the overall manufacturing performance positively. In this paper, an anthropomorphic robot with affect display ability is used to collaborate with its human partner so that they can collaboratively assemble several parts to manufacture a finished product. Firstly, in order to receive bioinspiration, the affective features in a similar human-human collaborative assembly task are investigated. Secondly, based on the human's affective features, the affect dynamics (the computational model of affect) for the robot is derived for the collaborative assembly task. Thirdly, based on the affect model, an affect-based intelligent motion planning strategy for the robot is developed so that the robot can dynamically adjust its affective states like a human with changes in the assembly task situations during the human-robot collaborative assembly task to make the assembly situations transparent to the human. Finally, the potential impacts of the proposed bio-inspired dynamic affect-based robot motion planning on human-robot interaction and manufacturing performance are discussed. © 2019 IEEE.",affect; bioinspiration; cognition; human-robot collaboration; manufacturing; motion planning,Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON,2019,Conference,Rahman S.M.M.,10.1109/SoutheastCon42311.2019.9020581
Drillers’ Cognitive Skills Monitoring Task,"Drilling incidents have emphasized that offshore drillers require a high level of cognitive skills, including situation awareness and decision making, to maintain safe and efficient well control. Although a number of tools for supporting operators’ cognition are available in other high-risk industries, there is no specific tool for drilling. We developed a prototype monitoring task simulating drilling scenarios, Drillers’ Situation Awareness Task, with drilling experts and piloted with 14 drilling personnel. Preliminary results suggest that it is viable as a tool for examining drillers’ cognition and has the potential for training and formatively assessing cognitive skills in drilling. © 2018 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",cognition; cognitive skills; computer tasks; Deepwater Horizon; drilling; expertise; oil riggers; simulation; situation awareness; skill development; training; workload,Ergonomics in Design,2019,Journal,Roberts R.C.; Flin R.; Cleland J.; Urquhart J.,10.1177/1064804617744713
How shift scheduling practices contribute to fatigue amongst freight rail operating employees: Findings from Canadian accident investigation,"Canada's freight rail system moves 70% of the country's surface goods and almost half of all exports (RAC, 2016). These include dangerous goods. Anonymous survey (TCRC, 2014) of freight railway operating employees suggests that many do not get enough sleep because of their work schedules, and that fatigue may be affecting their performance at work. Besides general impairments in attention and cognitive functioning, fatigue in railway operating employees slows reaction time to safety alarms and impairs conformance to train operating requirements. Shift scheduling practices can contribute to sleep-related fatigue by restricting sleep opportunities, requiring extended periods of wakefulness and by disrupting daily (circadian) rhythms. The primary goal of accident investigation is to identify causal and contributing factors so that similar occurrences can be prevented. A database search of Transportation Safety Board (TSB) rail investigation reports published in the 21-year period from 1995 to 2015 identified 18 that cited sleep-related fatigue of freight rail operating employees as a causal, contributing, or risk finding. This number represents about 20% of TSB rail investigations from the same period in which a human factors aspect of freight train activities was a primary cause. Exploration of accident themes suggests that management of fatigue and shift scheduling in the freight rail industry is a complex issue that is often not conducive to employee circadian rhythms and sleep requirements. It also suggests that current shift scheduling and fatigue management practices may be insufficient to mitigate the associated safety risk. Railway fatigue management systems that are based on the principles of modern sleep science are needed to improve scheduling practices and mitigate the ongoing safety risk. © 2018",Human factors; operator behavior; train crew,Accident Analysis and Prevention,2019,Journal,Rudin-Brown C.M.; Harris S.; Rosberg A.,10.1016/j.aap.2018.01.027
"Using a game engine for simulation in ergonomics analysis, design and education: An exploratory study","Among the possible approaches for building virtual environments (VE), researchers have recently started employing game engines (GE). Although there are already studies reporting the usage of GE-based VEs, their potential for supporting a more comprehensive workspace analysis (considering the physical, organizational and cognitive aspects of work) has yet to be better understood. The main goal of this paper is to investigate how a GE-based simulation of a real workplace (a local control room in an oil refinery) can be used as a tool by practitioners and researchers in evaluating work conditions. Participants (n = 38) were recruited to explore the simulation and evaluate the workplace dimensions represented. A comparison between the scores participants attributed to the work dimensions and the scores assigned by the ergonomics consultant was performed through a statistical test to verify whether they significantly differed or not. Out of the 10 aspects evaluated, only 3 presented significant differences, thus showing that GE suitability for ergonomics analysis is conditioned to the aspects represented. Qualitative data analysis highlighted participants’ perception of GEs potential as an analysis and educational tool, as well as a medium for fostering communication and stakeholder involvement in the design process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Game engine; Simulation; Virtual environments,Applied Ergonomics,2019,Journal,Paravizo E.; Braatz D.,10.1016/j.apergo.2019.01.001
On the development of a method for cognitive load assessment in manufacturing,"The increasing complexity and demands of assembly operations in manufacturing has been shown to lead to increased cognitive load in assembly workers. Previous work has outlined the complexity of an assembly worker's situation both in terms of difficulty and speed of work and there have been a few attempts at creating frameworks and methods for understanding the key aspects of what creates increased cognitive load. This paper presents the development of an analytic method, denoted CLAM (Cognitive Load Assessment for Manufacturing), and a tool for assessing cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly. It outlines the journey of the development as well as discusses and problematizes relevant meta-methodological issues paired with method development. The intended contribution of the work is to make a difference in reducing the cognitive load of assembly workers on the shop floor, thus focusing the development on applicability and usability of the tool in practice. With this purpose in mind, focus of the method development has been on the practitioners, i.e. the method should not require any expert knowledge to be applied. The CLAM method and accompanying documentation such as a handbook containing instructions towards using the method and interpreting the results, is available in an online tool. © 2019",Assembly; CLAM method; Cognitive load; Manufacturing; Method development,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2019,Journal,Thorvald P.; Lindblom J.; Andreasson R.,10.1016/j.rcim.2019.04.012

Vision-Based Hand Gesture Recognition for Human-Robot Collaboration: A Survey,"Recently, human-robot collaboration has attracted many research interests. Unlike traditional industrial robots, human-robot collaboration combines the advantages of robots with the flexibility and cognitive skills of human worker to work together in a shared manufacturing environment. However, to achieve an efficient human-robot collaboration, the communication channels between human workers and robots needs to be tackled. Vision-based hand gesture recognition has been effectively applied as the interface between humans and computer for long time. So, this paper presents a survey of the vision-based hand gesture recognition research in human-robot collaborative manufacturing. We first propose an overall model of vision-based hand gesture recognition for human-robot collaboration. Then, we review three essential technical components of this model: sensor technologies, hand gesture detection and segmentation and hand gesture classification. In addition, the relevant techniques for vision-based hand gesture recognition are compared. Towards the end of this paper, future research trends are discussed. © 2019 IEEE.",hand gesture; hand gesture recognition; human-robot collaboration,"2019 5th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics, ICCAR 2019",2019,Conference,Xia Z.; Lei Q.; Yang Y.; Zhang H.; He Y.; Wang W.; Huang M.,10.1109/ICCAR.2019.8813509
Understanding the meaning of human perception and cognitive biases for production planning and control,"The unawareness of production planners about the interaction of key performance indicators (KPIs) in manufacturing systems and misinterpretations of system states often leads to problems when they try to improve them. Exemplary, the lead time syndrome (LTS) represents one of these counterproductive actions. While planners aim to improve due date reliability by planned lead time adjustments, the result is often an aggravation of due date reliability. The underlying reason is that human perception and decision-making process can be biased. Despite its potential to improve the logistic performance, the meaning and the effects of cognitive biases on the decision-making processes in production planning and control were out of scope of recent investigations in the field of production logistics. The aim of this research is to create a starting point to close this research gap by the development of a heuristic framework identifying relevant decision making situations, the potentially active cognitive biases and the potential impact on logistics performance; for this, we combine the research streams of production planning and control (PPC), behavioral supply chain management and psychology. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Reducing driver distraction by improving secondary task performance through multimodal touchscreen interaction,"Methods of information presentation in the automotive space have been evolving continuously in recent years. As technology pushes forward the boundaries of what is possible, automobile manufacturers are trying to keep up with the current trends. Traditionally, the often-long development and quality control cycles of the automotive sector ensured slow yet steady progress. However, the exponential advancement in the mobile and hand-held computing space seen in the last 10 years has put immense pressure on automobile manufacturers to try to catch up. For this reason, we now see manufacturers trying to explore new techniques for in-vehicle interaction (IVI), which were ignored in the past. However, recent attempts have either simply extended the interaction model already used in mobile or handheld computing devices or increased visual-only presentation-of-information with limited expansion to other modalities (i.e. audio or haptics). This is also true for system interaction which generally happens within complex driving environments, making the primary task of a driver (driving) even more challenging. Essentially, there is an inherent need to design and research IVI systems that complement and natively support a multimodal interaction approach, providing all the necessary information without increasing driver’s cognitive load or at a bare minimum his/her visual load. In this research we focus on the key elements of IVI system: touchscreen interaction by developing prototype devices that can complement the conventional visual and auditory modalities in a simple and natural manner. Instead of adding primitive touch feedback cues to increase redundancy or complexity, we approach the issue by looking at the current requirements of interaction and complementing the existing system with natural and intuitive input and output methods, which are less affected by environmental noise than traditional multimodal systems. © 2019, The Author(s).",Driver distraction; Haptics; Human computer interaction; Multimodal interaction,SN Applied Sciences,2019,Journal,Farooq A.; Evreinov G.; Raisamo R.,10.1007/s42452-019-0923-4
Development of metric method and framework model of integrated complexity evaluations of production process for ergonomics workstations,"Staff in manufacturing sites not only need certain physical requirements for their allotted tasks but also utilise a large amount of information processing in the looming industrial age 4.0. This work established the Principles of Information Processing Economy in the production process and proposed a framework model of integrated complexity evaluation method for the production process, which combines both physical and cognitive loads while accounting for the effect of time stress. The method proposed in this study can be used for ergonomics evaluation of workstations. Compared with traditional evaluation methods, this method has good flexibility to account for the changes in labour loads in the industrial 4.0 eras and the role of various intelligent auxiliary systems.

Categorization errors for data entry in maintenancework-orders,"Manufacturing is seeing a significant push toward digitization of processes and decision making. This push is enabled by the increased availability of data. Yet the work of the maintenance team, one of the core subsystems in any production line, remains a largely human endeavor. It involves manual work on the equipment and data collection by maintainers, which itself involves free-text and pre-specified categories or controlled vocabulary, rather than collection via sensors. Often this data is un-useful, in that it does not support the digitization of work. This paper presents an approach using Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) to identify the human errors associated with entering un-useful data. A Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) is created, based on deconstructing the individual actions and decisions performed by maintainers in this process, backed by cognitive models to ground the task analysis in theory. A breakdown of human error modes for each task is provided as a list of Unsafe Acts (UAs), along with key contextual and organizational considerations, given as performance-shaping factors (PSFs). To demonstrate usage of this CTA, initial instantiation of a common HRA framework is provided as a case study, both to estimate base human error probabilities (BHEPs) and to motivate a discussion around initial risk mitigation strategies. © 2019 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

Ergonomics in Alternative Vehicle Design: Educating Students on the Practical Application of Anthropometric Data,"An instructor taught students to use industry-standard anthropometric data sets by applying them to a long-term, alternative vehicle design project within industrial design courses. Students learned how to verify existing anthropometric data through physical testing using three-dimensional mock-ups to produce a robust, anthropometrically appropriate model that balances multiple design constraints. As a practical exercise, students examined aesthetics and control interface of the vehicle interior focusing on human interaction, optimum comfort, and control within the confined constraints of the aerodynamically optimized vehicle packaging. Ultimately, students gained insights into how to apply ergonomics to new, varied design challenges through these educational tasks. © 2019 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",anthropometric data; cognitive ergonomics; ergonomics education; experiential learning; interface design; vehicle interior design,Ergonomics in Design,2019,Journal,Wanberg J.; Caston M.; Berthold D.,10.1177/1064804618782615
Blockchain Network Based Topic Mining Process for Cognitive Manufacturing,"Cognitive manufacturing has brought about an innovative change to the 4th industrial revolution based technology in combination with blockchain distributed ledger, which guarantees reliability, safety, and security, and mining-based intelligence information technology. In addition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning technologies are combined in processes for logistics, equipment, distribution, manufacturing, and quality management, so that an optimized intelligent manufacturing system is developed. This study proposes a topic mining process in blockchain-network-based cognitive manufacturing. The proposed method exploits the highly universal Fourier transform algorithm in order to analyze the context information of equipment and human body motion based on a variety of sensor input information in the cognitive manufacturing process. An accelerometer is used to analyze the movement of a worker in the manufacturing process and to measure the state energy of work, movement, rest, and others. Time is split in a certain unit and then a frequency domain is analyzed in real time. For the vulnerable security of smart devices, a side-chain-based distributed consensus blockchain network is utilized. If an event occurs, it is processed according to rules and the blocking of a transaction is saved in a distributed database. In the blockchain network, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based topic encapsulation is used for the mining process. The improved blockchain distributed ledger is applied to the manufacturing process to distribute the ledger of information in a peer-to-peer blockchain network in order to jointly record and manage the information. Further, topic encapsulation, a formatted statistical inference method to analyze a semantic environment, is designed. Through data mining, the time-series-based sequential pattern continuously appearing in the manufacturing process and the correlations between items in the process are found. In the cognitive manufacturing, an equalization-based LDA method is used for associate-clustering the items with high frequency. In the blockchain network, a meaningful item in the manufacturing step is extracted as a representative topic. In a cognitive manufacturing process, through data mining, potential information is extracted and hidden rules are found. Accordingly, in the cognitive manufacturing process, the mining process makes decision-making possible, especially advanced decision-making, such as potential risk, quality prediction, trend prediction, production monitoring, fault diagnosis, and data distortion. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Blockchain network; Cognitive manufacturing; Distributed ledger; Topic mining,Wireless Personal Communications,2019,Journal,Chung K.; Yoo H.; Choe D.; Jung H.,10.1007/s11277-018-5979-8
Testing the vertical and cyber-physical integration of cognitive robots in manufacturing,"In recent years, cognitive robots have started to find their way into manufacturing halls. However, the full potential of these robots can only be exploited through (a) an integration of the robots with the Manufacturing Execution System (MES), (b) a new and simpler way of programming based on robot skills, automated task planning, and knowledge modeling, and (c) enabling the robots to function in a shared human/robot workspace with the ability to handle unexpected situations. The STAMINA project has built a robotic system that meets these objectives for an automotive kitting application, which has also been tested, validated, and demonstrated in a relevant environment (TRL6). This paper describes the STAMINA robot system and the evaluation of this system on a series of realistic kitting tasks. The structure of the system, evaluation methodology, and experimental results, are presented along with the insights and experiences gained from this work. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Autonomous robot; Kitting; Robot skills,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2019,Journal,Krueger V.; Rovida F.; Grossmann B.; Petrick R.; Crosby M.; Charzoule A.; Martin Garcia G.; Behnke S.; Toscano C.; Veiga G.,10.1016/j.rcim.2018.11.011
Rethinking Software Development for Collaboration Technologies,"Digital data can be used to optimize manufacturing and create new business models. Becoming a digitally operating business not only requires introducing software but also making extensive process changes. This paper presents a design approach to participatory technology development that is human-centered in terms of changes required of users, their collaboration partners and organizational challenges confronting a company.

Singularity-robust inverse kinematics solver for tele-manipulation,"This paper investigates the effect of inverse kinematics (IK) on operator performance during the telemanipulation of an industrial robot. Robotic teleoperation is often preferred when manipulating objects in extreme conditions. In many applications, e.g., hazardous and high-consequence environments, operators cannot directly perceive the robot motions and have to rely only on CCTV views of the scene for situational awareness while teleoperating the heavy-duty industrial robots. Making best guesses for the IK plays a significant role on the task success rate and increases the operator cognitive load significantly. In this context, we develop a new optimisation-based IK solver that is robust with respect to the robot's singularities and assists the operator in generating smooth trajectories. Inspired by a successful algorithm used in computer graphics to solve the IK problem and devise smooth movements (FABRIK), our algorithm takes advantage also of the kinematic structure of the robot in order to decouple the notoriously difficult IK problem of orientation and position. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have compared its performance to that of the commonly used Jacobian pseudo inverse-based method in terms of positional accuracy and task-space reachability. We also report the results of telemanipulation experiments with human test-subjects. Our proposed IK algorithm outperforms classical IK methods on both objective metrics of task success, and subjective metrics of operator preference. © 2019 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering,2019,Conference,Ortenzi V.; Marturi N.; Rajasekaran V.; Adjigble M.; Stolkin R.,10.1109/COASE.2019.8842871
Cognitive diversity and innovative work behaviour: The mediating roles of task reflexivity and relationship conflict and the moderating role of perceived support,"Previous research has merely explored the positive relationship between cognitive diversity and creativity, but the potential negative side of cognitive diversity might also prevail and should be examined together with its positive side. To address this gap, our study, drawing on the categorization–elaboration model framework, explored both the positive and negative effects of cognitive diversity on creativity/innovation in a single model. Using data collected from 101 teams (including both team leaders and team members) in 10 Chinese manufacturing companies, we identified a dual pathway – namely, task reflexivity (i.e., positive pathway) and relationship conflict (i.e., negative pathway) – in the linkage of cognitive diversity and innovative work behaviour (i.e., IWB). Cognitive diversity encouraged IWB via the task reflexivity pathway, but impeded IWB via the relationship conflict pathway. We further demonstrated that perceived support for innovation moderated the relationships between cognitive diversity and task reflexivity/relationship conflict, with cognitive diversity more related to task reflexivity and less related to relationship conflict when perceived support for innovation was high. Moderated mediation effects also indicated that the positive indirect effect of cognitive diversity on IWB through task reflexivity existed only when support for innovation was high and that the negative indirect effect of cognitive diversity on IWB through relationship conflict occurred only when support for innovation was low. Practitioner points: This study informs team managers about the double-edged-sword effect of cognitive diversity on innovative work behaviour and calls for future research on how to manage diverse teams composed of individuals with different cognitions. Cognitive diversity was found to influence innovative work behaviour positively via task reflexivity and negatively via relationship conflict. Therefore, team managers should encourage their employees to rethink and re-evaluate task-related issues but not translate this into emotional exclusion. Perceived support for innovation strengthened the positive effect of cognitive diversity and weakened its negative influence. Therefore, team managers should build up such an environment by showing support and encouragement of innovation in teams of employees with different cognitions. © 2019 The British Psychological Society",cognitive diversity; innovative work behaviour; perceived support for innovation; relationship conflict; task reflexivity,Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology,2019,Journal,Chen X.; Liu J.; Zhang H.; Kwan H.K.,10.1111/joop.12259
Getting the mouse out of the box: Tool innovation in preschoolers,"Following the literature, children younger than 8 years rarely innovate a tool. Theories on innovation and comparative research on tool manufacturing suggest that children's performance may depend on the task context. The current study explored whether preschool children's poor performance in past research could be attributed to short time limits and the required manufacturing method. In four experiments, 5-year-olds needed to retrieve a toy from a tube by manufacturing a novel tool and using it successfully. The type of potentially functional materials varied among the experiments. Cumulative innovation rate was analyzed after 1 and 10 min. The 5-year-olds rarely innovated if merely “reshape” (modifying the material's shape) was offered as a potentially successful manufacturing method even when they had up to 10 min to complete the task (21%; Experiment 1). The vast majority of 5-year-olds succeeded if multiple manufacturing strategies were functional, but only if children had up to 10 min to complete the task (93%; Experiment 2). The innovation rate remained high if “detach” (separating material from a substrate) was not available (76%; Experiment 3) and if “subtract” (removing something from a material) was the only functional manufacturing method (71%; Experiment 4). Our findings suggest that even preschool-aged children are “good innovators” if (a) they have enough time and (b) manufacturing methods other than reshape can be used to solve the problem. However, they seem to struggle if (a) they have only 1 min to complete the task and (b) solving the task requires them to reshape a material. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Cognitive development; Creativity; Preschool children; Problem solving; Time; Tool innovation,Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,2019,Journal,Voigt B.; Pauen S.; Bechtel-Kuehne S.,10.1016/j.jecp.2019.03.005
Why consider the human-in-the-loop in automated cyber-physical production systems? Two cases from cross-company cooperation,"Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Production can increase efficiency and effectiveness of workflows in manufacturing companies and production networks. Despite ubiquitous automation, people are essential in socio-technical cyber-physical production systems due to unique cognitive capabilities, as final arbitrators, or for ethical and legal reasons. However, the design of interfaces between the human-in-the-loop and production systems poses challenges not yet been sufficiently elaborated in research and practice. We present two behavioural studies in the context of inter-company collaboration that show why considering the human-in-the-loop is crucial: The first study shows that information complexity and individual differences shape the overall decision quality. With increasing information complexity, the decision speed decreases and the decision accuracy descends. Consequently, a fine balance between necessary, abundant, and superfluous information must be found. The second experiment studies human decision making in complex environments using a business simulation. We found that correct decision aids can augment the human-in-the-loop's decision making and that these can increase usability, trust, and proft. Yet, incorrect decision support has the opposite effect. Guidelines for designing socio-technical cyber-physical production systems and a research agenda conclude this article. © 2019 IEEE.",Automation Bias; Automation Complacency; Decision Support System; Human Factors; Human-In-The-Loop; Internet of Production,IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),2019,Conference,Brauner P.; Ziefle M.,10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972142
"Pushing, pulling and manoeuvring an industrial cart: a psychophysiological study","One of the most frequent manual occupational tasks involves the pushing and pulling of a cart. Although several studies have associated health risks with pushing and pulling, the effects are not clear since occupational tasks have social, cognitive and physical components. The present work investigates a real case of a pushing and pulling occupational task from a manufacturing company. The study initially characterizes the case in accordance with Standard No. ISO 11228-2:2007 as low risk. An experiment with 14 individuals during three modalities of pushing and pulling was performed in order to further investigate the task with the application of electrophysiology. At the end, a simple questionnaire was given. The results show electrophysiological differences among the three modalities of pushing and pulling, with a major difference between action with no load and fully loaded with a full range of motions on the cart to handle. © 2017, © 2017 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).",electrodermal activity; pushing–pulling; Standard No. ISO 11228-2:2007,International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics,2019,Journal,Giagloglou E.; Radenkovic M.; Brankovic S.; Antoniou P.; Zivanovic-Macuzic I.,10.1080/10803548.2017.1370231
Cognitive Cyber-Physical System (C-CPS) for human-robot collaborative manufacturing,"In this paper, the fundamental concept of the newly coined framework C-CPS (cognitive cyber-physical system) is introduced with application to human-robot collaborative manufacturing. A human-robot hybrid cell is developed where a human and a robot collaborate to perform assembly of components in manufacturing. Human and robot's mutual trust, an expression of human and machine cognition, is modeled and computed in realtime for the collaborative task. In the proposed C-CPS framework, a cyber system (software system) along with necessary hardware (sensors) computes the mutual trust in real-time based on the performance and precision of the physical system (human and robot). The computed mutual trust is then communicated to the robot via the software system and to the human via a visual interface. The computed trust values are also used to control the motion of the robot based on an algorithm, and to stimulate the action of the human based on warnings communicated to the human via the visual interface. The performance of the physical system also impacts the cyber system (computing), and the vice versa. The framework is implemented with an actual human-robot collaborative assembly task. The experimental evaluation results show satisfactory performance of the proposed C-CPS in term of human-system interaction, manufacturing efficiency and quality. © 2019 IEEE.",,"2019 14th Annual Conference System of Systems Engineering, SoSE 2019",2019,Conference,Mizanoor Rahman S.M.,10.1109/SYSOSE.2019.8753835
Human reliability study on the door operation from the view of Deep Machine Learning,"Despite the advances made in developing human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, a gap remains between the methods developed by HRA researchers and the ways HRA practitioners actually use. Automated process control and control room operating supervision are important in major process industries. This paper introduces operator's operational and cognitive errors in the process reliability analysis based on a review of current research on HRA techniques, a procedural framework of qualitative screening phase for the control rooms in the metro industry context, and panel discussions with HRA analysts, systems analysts, and control operators. HRA method Standardized Plant Analysis Risk-HRA (SPARH) based on Machine Learning is utilized to evaluate human error probabilities (HEPs) of action and diagnosis in the Door Operation of Guangzhou Metro Corporation (GMC) Line 1. The results show that improving staff's experience/training level will greatly enhance operating reliability of door operation. Considering diagnosis complexity and situational awareness, different decision makers have different effects on the operating reliability. We suggest that the quality of ergonomics/Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the availability of existing ergonomics/HMI assessment tools should be evaluated based on industry standards. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Decision making; Human error probability (HEP); Human reliability analysis (HRA); Machine learning; Qualitative screening,Future Generation Computer Systems,2019,Journal,Zhan Y.; Tadikamalla P.R.; Craft J.A.; Lu J.; Yuan J.; Pei Z.; Li S.,10.1016/j.future.2018.11.055
Combining simulation and augmented reality methods for enhanced worker assistance in manual assembly,"Due to mass customization product variety increased steeply in the automotive industry, entailing the increment of worker’s cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Although worker assistance methods for cognitive automation already exist, they proof insufficient in terms of usability and achieved time saving. Given the rising importance of simulation towards autonomous production planning, a novel approach is proposed using human simulation data in context of worker assistance methods to alleviate cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Within this paper, a new concept for augmented reality-based worker assistance is presented. Additionally, a comparative user study (N=24) was conducted with conventional worker assistance methods to evaluate a prototypical implementation of the concept. The results illustrate the enhancing opportunity of the novel approach to save cognitive abilities and to induce performance improvements. The implementation provided stable information presentation during the entire experiment. However, with regard to the recentness, there has to be carried out further developments and research, concerning performance adaptions and investigations of the effectiveness. © 2019 The Authors.

Immersive Training: Outcomes from Small Scale AR/VR Pilot-Studies,"From paper-based and face-to-face workshops to electronic and digital simulated educational programs, vast amounts are spent to train workers to perform assembly-tasks, especially in manufacturing. This need for robust, cost-effective, adaptable learning environments supported the rise of Immersive Training. The phenomenon of utilizing the immersive capabilities of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to construct learning environments, i.e. Immersive Training, has flourished, mainly due to the rise and availability of commercial headsets and applications. In this paper, we describe and analyze two such scenarios, a VR lab experiment created to test the VR capabilities in training and a field study exploring the use of AR in a large manufacturing company.

Do autonomous vehicle driving styles affect user state?: A preliminary investigation,"A bursting number of achievements in the autonomous vehicle industry have been obtained during the past decades. Various systems have been developed to make automated driving possible. Due to the algorithm used in the autonomous vehicle system, the performance of the vehicle differs from one to another. However, very few studies have given insight into the influence caused by implementing different algorithms from a human factors point of view. Two systems based on two algorithms with different characteristics are utilized to generate the two driving styles of the autonomous vehicle, which are implemented into a driving simulator in order to create the autonomous driving experience. User’s skin conductance (SC) data, which enables the evaluation of user’s cognitive workload and mental stress were recorded and analyzed. Subjective measures were applied by filling out Swedish occupational fatigue inventory (SOFI-20) to get a user self-reporting perspective view of their behavior changes along with the experiments. The results showed that human’s states were affected by the driving styles of different autonomous systems, especially in the period of speed variation. By analyzing users’ self-assessment data, a correlation was observed between the user “Sleepiness” and the driving style of the autonomous vehicle. These results would be meaningful for the future development of the autonomous vehicle systems, in terms of balancing the performance of the vehicle and user’s experience.

A learning system for adjustment processes based on human sensory perceptions,"Creating, designing and adjusting products are essential decision processes underlying creative industries, such as painting, perfume, food and beverage industries. These processes require the participation and continuous supervision of professionals with highly-developed expert sensory abilities. Training of these experts is very complex due to the difficulty of transmitting intuitive knowledge obtained from perception. A new methodology for capturing this sensory expert knowledge that relies on a machine learning tool, previously trained with 'state-action’ type patterns, jointly with an actions generator module, is proposed in this work. The method is based on a closed loop architecture together with the decomposition of complex sensory knowledge into basic elements capable of being handled by standard machine learning systems. A real case application to color-adjustment in the automotive paint manufacturing industry is presented showing the potential benefits of the method. © 2018",Artificial cognitive systems; Color adjustment; Color formulation; Expert knowledge management,Cognitive Systems Research,2018,Journal,Ruiz F.J.; Agell N.; Angulo C.; Sánchez M.,10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.06.011
Efficiency 4.0 for industry 4.0,"Operators of cyber-physical production system (CPPS) will use handheld interactive control panels for supervising production processes. These interactive and handheld control panels will present numerous sensors data. Processing of such complex data for task fulfilment in critical scenario will cause cognitive workload on operators. The prevalent industry efficiency measures so far have focused on human physical workload measures; the human cognitive load has not been considered in industrial practices. Smart factories in the near future will begin to integrate intelligent machines with complex communication network systems between human and machines. In this paper, we argue that the changing industrial scenario requires developing new measures of production efficiency. As a result, we propose a theoretical framework for a smart factory efficiency measure as a function of the combined efficiencies of the human cognitive system, smart machines, and their shared communication systems. © 2019 Naveen Kumar and Jyoti Kumar.",HCI; Human cognitive efficiency; Industry 4.0; Production efficiency,Human Technology,2019,Journal,Kumar N.; Kumar J.,10.17011/ht/urn.201902201608
Cognitive Processes of the Construction Engineer: Planning and Decision Making in Production and Safety,"In recent years, in the construction industry, facing the limitations of behavioral approaches, the approach to cognitive aspects has been considered an alternative to improve production and safety. The goal of this article is to understand the cognitive processes of the construction engineer that allow them to anticipate problems in several Levels of Anticipation of the construction process, planning, and decision making in production and safety. To achieve this goal we use, interacting with the ethnographic study, the methodology of activity analysis and, in particular, what is called approach of the course of action. Thus, the cases presented make it possible to understand how the construction engineer, using information available in the Levels of Anticipation of the construction process, manipulates resources—personal (tacit and explicit knowledge, skills, etc.), material (designs), and social (relationship with his team)—when he perceives problems. By understanding their fortes, we can better foment their cognitive process. Thus, the theory is relevant and contributes to describe and explain the processes of human problem solving, decision making, and planning. © 2019, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",cognitive processes; construction sector; decision making; knowledge management; problem solving,Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making,2019,Journal,Fonseca E.D.; Lima F.P.A.; Duarte F.,10.1177/1555343418819646
Foundation for a classification of collaboration levels for human-robot cooperation in manufacturing,"Industry 4.0 aims to support the factory of the future, involving increased use of information systems and new ways of using automation, such as collaboration where a robot and a human share work on a single task. We propose a classification of collaboration levels for Human-Robot collaboration (HRC) in manufacturing that we call levels of collaboration (LoC), formed to provide a conceptual model conducive to the design of assembly lines incorporating HRC. This paper aims to provide a more theoretical foundation for such a tool based on relevant theories from cognitive science and other perspectives of human-technology interaction, strengthening the validity and scientific rigour of the envisioned LoC tool. The main contributions consist of a theoretical grounding to motivate the transition from automation to collaboration, which are intended to facilitate expanding the LoC classification to support HRC, as well as an initial visualization of the LoC approach. Future work includes fully defining the LoC classification as well as operationalizing functionally different cooperation types. We conclude that collaboration is a means to an end, so collaboration is not entered for its own sake, and that collaboration differs fundamentally from more commonly used views where automation is the focus. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Using content analysis through simulation-based training for offshore drilling operations: Implications for process safety,"Human factors play a large role in the creation and optimization of process safety in offshore drilling and well control operations by assessing and mitigating human error. The current industry practice relies on the simulation-based trainings for its drilling crews which lack the measurement and evaluation of human factors and non-technical skills. One way to improve training is to measure and evaluate an individual's performance and non-technical skills, but there are no such validated, psychological tools made for offshore drilling operation. A way to create these tools is with the use of the content analysis and process tracing techniques, which are frequently used in research to identify psychological processes via communication. This paper presents the potential use of content analysis as a tool to optimize simulation-based trainings that can be applied to improve human factors in drilling and well control activities. To put this to test, an interactive trip-in experiment was specially designed in the University of Oklahoma virtual reality drilling simulator that allowed four participants as assistant drillers (two Novices and two Experts) to individually engage in four similar simulations and communicate with a driller in a manner similar to a real-world setting. The results from content analysis were translated into semantic maps to explore individual psychological states which informs their cognitive processes (e.g. working memory, long-term memory, metacognition) used during the experiment. The research found significant differences in the problem-solving techniques for the Novices and the Experts meaning, that perhaps they approached the problem psychologically differently. Results are a proof of concept that content analysis is an additional tool that may allow for improved performance evaluation and human factors optimization through simulation-based trainings. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Content analysis; Human factors; Offshore drilling; Process safety; Simulation-based training,Process Safety and Environmental Protection,2019,Journal,Naqvi S.A.M.; Raza M.; Ybarra V.T.; Salehi S.; Teodoriu C.,10.1016/j.psep.2018.10.016
Large-area MRI-compatible epidermal electronic interfaces for prosthetic control and cognitive monitoring,"Skin-interfaced medical devices are critically important for diagnosing disease, monitoring physiological health and establishing control interfaces with prosthetics, computer systems and wearable robotic devices. Skin-like epidermal electronic technologies can support these use cases in soft and ultrathin materials that conformally interface with the skin in a manner that is mechanically and thermally imperceptible. Nevertheless, schemes so far have limited the overall sizes of these devices to less than a few square centimetres. Here, we present materials, device structures, handling and mounting methods, and manufacturing approaches that enable epidermal electronic interfaces that are orders of magnitude larger than previously realized. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate devices for electrophysiological recordings that enable coverage of the full scalp and the full circumference of the forearm. Filamentary conductive architectures in open-network designs minimize radio frequency-induced eddy currents, forming the basis for structural and functional compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate the use of the large-area interfaces for the multifunctional control of a transhumeral prosthesis by patients who have undergone targeted muscle-reinnervation surgery, in long-term electroencephalography, and in simultaneous electroencephalography and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,Nature Biomedical Engineering,2019,Journal,Tian L.; Zimmerman B.; Akhtar A.; Yu K.J.; Moore M.; Wu J.; Larsen R.J.; Lee J.W.; Li J.; Liu Y.; Metzger B.; Qu S.; Guo X.; Mathewson K.E.; Fan J.A.; Cornman J.; Fatina M.; Xie Z.; Ma Y.; Zhang J.; Zhang Y.; Dolcos F.; Fabiani M.; Gratton G.; Bretl T.; Hargrove L.J.; Braun P.V.; Huang Y.; Rogers J.A.,10.1038/s41551-019-0347-x
Visualization and explainable machine learning for efficient manufacturing and system operations,"To enable Industry 4.0 successfully, there is a need to build a resilient automation system that can quickly recover after having been attacked or robustly sustain continued operations while being threatened, enable an automated monitoring evolution via various sensor channels in real time, and use advanced machine learning and data analytics to formulate strategies to mitigate and eliminate faults, threats, and malicious attacks. It is envisioned that if we can develop an intelligent model that (a) represents a meaningful, realistic environment and complex entity containing manufacturing Internet of Things interdependent and independent properties that are stepping-stones of the cyber kill chain or precursors of the onset of cyberattacks; (b) can learn and predict potential errors and formulate offense/defense strategies and healing solutions; (c) can enable cognitive ability and human-in-the-loop analytics in real time; and (d) can facilitate system behavior changes to disrupt the attack cascade, then the hosting system can learn how to neutralize threats and attacks and self-repair infected or damaged links autonomously. In this article, our preliminary work presents a visual analytics framework and technique for situational awareness, including autonomously monitoring, diagnosing, and prognosticating the state of cyber-physical systems. Our approach, presented in this article, relies on visual characterizations of multivariate time series and real-time predictive analytics to highlight potential faults, threats, and malicious attacks.

Digital human and robot simulation in automotive assembly using siemens process simulate: A feasibility study,"The global trend toward customization in the automotive sector has led to significant increase in the variability of components available to the assembly process. The increase in product variability directly impacts the complexity of the manufacturing process and consequently increases the possibility for human-generated error. Several solutions have been offered to reduce the potential risk of error in complex assembly processes which can be generalized as cognitive-based or physical-based assistive methods. Creating a digital twin of the process, both the human and machine elements, is a preliminary requirement before deploying such solutions in a real-world manufacturing environment. The digital twin simulation provides a platform for testing a variety of solutions and what-if scenarios to improve planning and decision making. While there exist commercially available products of human digital twin modeling, these do not provide a proper platform for human - machine interaction modeling. In the context of this work, machine is defined as an industrial robot with an objective of investigating the feasibility of deploying a smart collaborative robotic solution to provide physical assistance to the human worker in a cumbersome manufacturing process. To do so, an overhead assembly operation from a real-world vehicle assembly plant is identified, and a digital twin of human model is created in Siemens Tecnomatix suite. The study starts with the simulation of various human anthropomorphic models to discover the limitations in performing the assembly tasks based on gender, weight and height. Furthermore, a digital twin of a mobile robot designed to provide physical assistance to the human to perform the assembly operation is introduced. The results are evaluated in terms of process time, joint ergonomic impact and reveal some current limitations of combined digital twin modeling of humans and robots collaborating. © 2019 The Authors.

Vocational knowledge improvement method on massive open online course for the thai tourism worker,"The adopted of Massive open online courses (MOOC) in the Thailand Tourism sector is aimed at promoting the quality of human resources to reach ASEAN tourism standard. However, traditional vocational education and training do not seem to provide knowledge improvement for many of the workers in the postmodern era since the completion rate of MOOC is very low. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a knowledge improvement method for knowledge workers who are working in the tourism industry. In this study, the cognitive load theory and interactive media were employed as methods which are able to improve the knowledge workers’ learning performance via mobile devices. Two experiments were performed in order to find the optimal length of video lectures and the effectiveness of interactive media in MOOCs. The first experiment was performed on sixty-four tourism industry knowledge workers who were divided into four groups randomly. Each group was loaded with different video lengths and different segmentations. The second experiment was done on the same focus group by separating them into control and experiment groups. The experiment group was assigned to use interactive media (2D learning game) right after watching the learning video. The results show that, by using the same amount of learning time, the group who were using the smaller video lengths performed significantly better due to lower consume of information. Differences in knowledge tests were examined across different conditions of video lengths to measure the learning performance. As a result, the groups which were equipped with interactive media achieved higher test scores than those without it. The evaluation method for the performance test was the same as in the first experiment. The results indicate that the interactive group with shorter of video lengths performed significantly better than the other group exposed to traditional online learning (using longer videos in a non-interactive manner). © 2019, ECTI Association Sirindhon International Institute of Technology.

Approaching single molecule sensing: Predictive sweat sensor design for ultra-low limits of detection,"Sweat provides direct information of the real-time emotional and cognitive state of the subject, with applications ranging from situational awareness and mission effectiveness of armed forces to disease diagnosis for clinicians. Development of a broad class of human performance monitoring devices to quantify sweat biomarkers necessitates non-invasive, real-time monitoring of ultra-low concentrations (μM to fM) of hormones, proteins, and neurotransmitters. Field effect transistors are the predominant sensor approach whereby the gate electrode is modified with a selective bio-recognition element (BRE). However, FETs have diminished sensitivity in high ionic strength environments associated with sweat. Alternatively, BRE-modified photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have high sensitivity in high ionic strength fluids, low cost at the manufacturing scale, and enable a number of novel device concepts to achieve ultra-low levels of detection. One major technological challenge is to predict the limit of detection (LoD), or sensor response function, for a particular PIC geometry in a microfluidic chamber. LoD is highly dependent on analytic capture efficiency, fluid dynamics and affinity, analyte/light interaction, and analyte concentration. This work presents finite element simulations to emulate microfluidic BRE sweat sensors and provide a predictive limit of detection for different sensing structures or elements. Specifically, the optimum mass transfer and kinetics for sensing approaching single molecule detection is discussed, including flow characteristics, biomarker size, adsorption and desorption kinetics, and sensor geometry. Key metrics include capture efficiency (molecules being captured over molecules entering channel), time to reach steady state, and temporal adsorption site occupancy to predict PIC system LoD. It is found that these systems are kinetically controlled, with capture efficiencies remaining below 1% even for kads/kdes ratios of 1010. The need for adsorption kinetics measured for flow systems instead of stationary fluid systems is stressed, as these parameters are what need to be optimized to greatly increase analyte capture. © 2019 SPIE.",Bio-recognition elements; Biosensing; Finite element simulations; Fluid dynamics; Microfluidics; Photonic integrated circuits; Photonic sensing; Sweat sensing,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2019,Conference,Harris J.; Bickford J.; Cho P.; Coppock M.; Farrell M.; Holthoff E.; Ratcliff E.L.,10.1117/12.2518543
A strategic model to take the first step towards industry 4.0 in SMEs,"Over the last few years, there has been a clear evolution in the suppliers of the automotive industry due to constant demands imposed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), systematically requiring an increase in the level of quality and competitiveness of products. The continuous requirement to increase productivity in this sector makes it necessary to modernize technology and the need to monitor all production at a distance, also making the manufacturing process more autonomous. However, more traditional companies in developing countries cannot move abruptly to an integrated production and management system. Thus, it is necessary to establish an industrial implementation strategy for this type of companies. The evolution of the work method on the factory shop-floor must be gradual so that there is a greater effectiveness in the change of working paradigm. This paper aims to establish a model of gradual implementation of industry 4.0 in SMEs currently working in a traditional way, so that workers can have the opportunity to evolve in their cognitive capacities with technological evolution, promoting a symbiosis between technological change and the change of mentality, habits of work and technological knowledge of the workers. In order to test the validity of the model, it was developed a case study, through its implementation in a components' cutting process for the automotive industry. The progress should follow the whole procedure of assembling and shipping of the intermediate product in order to increase their reliability and monitoring. A production control system based on automation and information was created, which allows the product state to be known in real time, triggering the whole process of logistics and subsequent processing in a completely automatic way. After the implementation of this pilot system, it is much simpler to proceed with the training and technological updating of the workers regarding the following processes. © 2019 The Authors.

A cyber-physical systems approach to cognitive enterprise,"Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems are paradigms that have an important influence on enterprise systems architecture and implementation.

One-fits-all vs. Tailor-made: User-centered workstations for field assembly with an application in aircraft parts manufacturing,"Field assembly of large components for aircraft, ships, trains or big machinery is often done in a rather unstructured environment, with little concern for the individual needs of the involved personnel. Confronted with a shortage of qualified personnel and a generally aging workforce, workstation designers need to put more emphasis on improving ergonomics and allowing for individual adjustments and support for a particular worker. Human factor engineering traditionally uses a “percentile-approach” to work-design, preventing an exact adjustment to the ergonomic needs of particular users. New technological advances provide opportunities for major improvements; novel assistance and information systems allow the accommodation of the needs of an increasingly diverse assembly workforce, while minimizing overall physical and mental stress. Based on a recently developed synopsis of options for individualization of assembly workstations, an example of an application in field assembly is being presented and illustrated by a full-scale demonstrator for the assembly of large scale composite parts for the aerospace industry. The pilot-installation combines a projector-based augmented reality environment for dynamic worker-information with automated operator position tracking and field of vision positioning. Finally, a comprehensive concept, that includes other dimensions of individualization, is presented. © 2019 The Authors.

Interactive Learning of Assembly Processes using Digital Assistance,"Due to an increasing demand for individualized products and the resulting high variability in manufacturing processes, flexibility and cognitive skills of human workers are highly important for manual assembly processes. Nowadays, novice workers are often trained by colleagues or foremen in addition to and alongside their main work. Since time is usually scarce and the procedure can be highly variable, one solution for the companies can be the introduction of digital assistance systems. Hence, the focus of this contribution is the initial learning procedure of the assembly of a new and complex product. Therefore, a user study was conducted in close cooperation with an industrial partner to compare the traditional way of training to the self-paced learning with a digital assistance system. During the execution of the user study, objective data was recorded to allow precise measurements of the individual learning progress. Furthermore, the subjective learning experience was assessed using a customized questionnaire and a standardized task load metric. The evaluation of the study results suggests that learning autonomously with a digital assistance system leads to similar performance curves as learning the process through a personal explanation. © 2019 The Authors.

A comparative study on computer-integrated set-ups to design human-centred manufacturing systems,"Manufacturing ergonomics refers to the application of ergonomic principles and human factors analysis to the design of manufacturing tasks with the final aim to optimize the workers’ wellbeing and guarantee the expected process performance. Traditional design approaches are based on the observation of individual workers performing their jobs, the detection of unnatural postures (e.g., bending, twisting, overextending, rotating), and the definition of late corrective actions according to ergonomic guidelines. Recently, computer-integrated simulations based on virtual prototypes and digital human models (DHMs) can be used to assess manufacturing ergonomics on virtual manikins operating in digital workplaces. Such simulations allow validating different design alternatives and optimizing the workstation design before the creation, and pave the way to a new approach to manufacturing system design. The present paper aims at comparing different computer-integrated set-ups to support the design of human-centred manufacturing workstations. It defines a protocol analysis to support workstation design by analysing both physical and cognitive aspects, and applies the protocol within different digital set-ups. In particular, the study investigates a 2D desktop set-up using standardized DHMs and a 3D immersive mixed reality set-up based on motion capture of real workers’ acting into a mixed environment, comparing them with the traditional approach. An industrial case study focusing on design optimization of a manufacturing workstation in the energy industry is used to test the effectiveness of the two digital set-ups for the definition of re-design actions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Digital human models; Human factors; Human-centred design; Manufacturing ergonomics; Mixed reality,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2019,Journal,Peruzzini M.; Pellicciari M.; Gadaleta M.,10.1016/j.rcim.2018.03.009
Managing human errors: Augmented reality systems as a tool in the quality journey,"The manufacturing industry is shifting, entering a new era with smart and connected devices. The fourth industrial revolution is promising increased growth and productivity by the Smart Factory and within the enabling technologies is Augmented Reality (AR). At the same time as the technology is introduced, errors in manufacturing are a problem which is affecting the productivity and the quality. This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation- reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems. Furthermore, the empirical findings showed that for managing human errors, the main bottleneck of an AR system is the systems artificial intelligence capabilities. © 2019 The Authors.",Artificial intelligence; Augmented Reality; Human error; Industry 4.0; smart factory,Procedia Manufacturing,2019,Conference,Qeshmy D.E.; Makdisi J.; Da Silva E.H.D.R.; Angelisa J.,10.1016/j.promfg.2018.12.005
Enabling the human in the loop: Linked data and knowledge in industrial cyber-physical systems,"Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems have benefitted substantially from the introduction of a range of technology enablers. These include web-based and semantic computing, ubiquitous sensing, internet of things (IoT) with multi-connectivity, advanced computing architectures and digital platforms, coupled with edge or cloud side data management and analytics, and have contributed to shaping up enhanced or new data value chains in manufacturing. While parts of such data flows are increasingly automated, there is now a greater demand for more effectively integrating, rather than eliminating, human cognitive capabilities in the loop of production related processes. Human integration in Cyber-Physical environments can already be digitally supported in various ways. However, incorporating human skills and tangible knowledge requires approaches and technological solutions that facilitate the engagement of personnel within technical systems in ways that take advantage or amplify their cognitive capabilities to achieve more effective sociotechnical systems. After analysing related research, this paper introduces a novel viewpoint for enabling human in the loop engagement linked to cognitive capabilities and highlighting the role of context information management in industrial systems. Furthermore, it presents examples of technology enablers for placing the human in the loop at selected application cases relevant to production environments. Such placement benefits from the joint management of linked maintenance data and knowledge, expands the power of machine learning for asset awareness with embedded event detection, and facilitates IoT-driven analytics for product lifecycle management. © 2019 The Authors",Asset lifecycle management; Context information management; Cyber-physical systems; Human in the loop; Internet of things; Maintenance; Product lifecycle management,Annual Reviews in Control,2019,Journal,Emmanouilidis C.; Pistofidis P.; Bertoncelj L.; Katsouros V.; Fournaris A.; Koulamas C.; Ruiz-Carcel C.,10.1016/j.arcontrol.2019.03.004
An assessment of the psychological undertones to accidents in manufacturing industries,"To err is human. This apparently explains the occurrence of accidents in manufacturing industries around the world. The study reviewed notable empirical findings on the psychological undertones to the causes of accidents in manufacturing industries in the past ten years. Documentary cum content analyses methods were adopted. The study spanned Nigeria, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Malaysia and Thailand. The core research questions are: What are the categories of factors responsible for accidents in manufacturing industries? What proportion of the various factors attributed for accidents in the manufacturing industries are psychological? What are the psychological factors responsible for accidents in manufacturing industries. Some of the categories of causes found were: financial, mechanical, and psychological. Seventy-three percent [73%] of the identified causes of accidents in manufacturing industries had psychological undertone, and virtually all these causes were preventable. It was therefore recommended that concerted efforts should be made to evolve valid psychological instruments for collating the prevalence and causes of accidents in manufacturing industries around the world; there should be more astute psychological screening of factory managers and proprietors for mental health; and there should be regular psychological training to build the cognitive, emotional and social intelligences of keys players in manufacturing industries to circumvent the occurrence of accidents in manufacturing industries around the world. © TJPRC Pvt.

Predicting limits of detection in real-time sweat-based human performance monitoring,"Sweat-based human performance monitoring devices offer the possibility of real-time emotional and cognitive awareness in both civilian and military applications. Broad applicability and point of use necessitate non-invasive, printable, flexible, wearable chemical sensors with low power consumption. Sweat fluidics must enable movement of sweat across the sensor compartment within 1 minute to assure only fresh sweat is at the chemical sensor. The sensor material should have reaction kinetics to capture a sufficient number of target molecules for quantification in real-time (< 1minute). Chemical selectivity is critical in complex biofluids such as sweat, which may be comprised of 800+ biomarkers. Given these constraints, there continues to be significant technological barriers for translation from laboratory-based proof-of-concept demonstrations and scalable manufacturing of devices. Using finite element simulations, we focus on determining which sweat flow geometry and chemical capture dynamics are best suited to meet temporal performance requirements. Two common sensing approaches are compared and contrasted: bio-recognition chemical adsorption events and electrochemical detection. Responsivity of both mechanisms is shown to be highly dependent on fluid dynamics, analyte capture efficiency, analyte concentration, and reaction kinetics. Key metrics of temporal response and capture efficiency will be discussed for a number of state of the art electronic sensor materials, with a focus on the validity of printable platforms. © 2019 SPIE.

Improving manufacturing productivity by combining cognitive engineering and lean-six sigma methods,"Increasing automation of manufacturing has changed the relationship between workers and the technology employed to get work done. Cognitive work is replacing manual labour.

SPARC: Self-paced network representation for few-shot rare category characterization,"In the era of big data, it is often the rare categories that are of great interest in many high-impact applications, ranging from financial fraud detection in online transaction networks to emerging trend detection in social networks, from network intrusion detection in computer networks to fault detection in manufacturing. As a result, rare category characterization becomes a fundamental learning task, which aims to accurately characterize the rare categories given limited label information. The unique challenge of rare category characterization, i.e., the non-separability nature of the rare categories from the majority classes, together with the availability of the multi-modal representation of the examples, poses a new research question: how can we learn a salient rare category oriented embedding representation such that the rare examples are well separated from the majority class examples in the embedding space, which facilitates the follow-up rare category characterization? To address this question, inspired by the family of curriculum learning that simulates the cognitive mechanism of human beings, we propose a self-paced framework named SPARC that gradually learns the rare category oriented network representation and the characterization model in a mutually beneficial way by shifting from the 'easy' concept to the target 'difficult' one, in order to facilitate more reliable label propagation to the large number of unlabeled examples. The experimental results on various real data demonstrate that our proposed SPARC algorithm: (1) shows a significant improvement over state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on representing the rare categories that are non-separable from the majority classes; (2) outperforms the existing methods on rare category characterization tasks. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Network Embedding; Rare Category Analysis; Self-Paced Learning,Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2018,Conference,Zhou D.; He J.; Yang H.; Fan W.,10.1145/3219819.3219952
"The Influence of Safety Climate, Safety Leadership, Workload, and Accident Experiences on Risk Perception: A Study of Korean Manufacturing Workers","Background: The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of workers’ perceived workload, accident experiences, supervisors’ safety leadership, and an organization's safety climate on the cognitive and emotional risk perception. Methods: Six hundred and twenty employees in a variety of manufacturing organizations were asked to complete to a questionnaire. Among them, a total of 376 employees provided valid data for analysis. To test the hypothesis, correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were used. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS program, version 23. Results: The results indicated that workload and accident experiences have a positive influence and safety leadership and safety climate have a negative influence on the cognitive and emotional risk perception. Workload, safety leadership, and the safety climate influence perceived risk more than accident experience, especially for the emotional risk perception. Conclusion: These results indicated that multilevel factors (organization, group, and individual) play a critical role in predicting individual risk perceptions. Based on these results, therefore, to reduce risk perception related with unsafe behaviors and accidents, organizations need to conduct a variety of safety programs that enhance their safety climate beyond simple safety-related education and training. Simultaneously, it needs to seek ways to promote supervisors’ safety leadership behaviors (e.g., site visits, feedback, safety communication, etc.). In addition, it is necessary to adjust work speed and amount and allocate task considering employees’ skill and ability to reduce the workload for reducing risk perception. © 2018 The Authors",Accident experience; Risk perception; Safety climate; Safety leadership; Workload,Safety and Health at Work,2018,Journal,Oah S.; Na R.; Moon K.,10.1016/j.shaw.2018.01.008
Safety assessment in oil drilling work system based on empirical study and Analytic Network Process,"Safety assessment is an essential work to guarantee the safety of oil drilling. There are relations and dependencies between human factors in oil drilling work system. Therefore, the safety of oil drilling work system should be analyzed in a comprehensive way. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is applied to establish rational and applicable index system for investigating human errors. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) method is used to obtain the priorities of human factors considering the interdependences, however, the deficiency of ANP is that the obtained results are subject to experts’ cognitive limitations and psychological biases. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is used to form the ANP model auxiliary, which may be expected to overcome subjective opinions from experts and provide a more pertinent and practical safety strategies. A survey is conducted to explore the importance of human factors through questionnaires of which 283 pieces made up the original data. Afterwards, the human factors’ weights are calculated by the ANP method. As a comparison, a frequency-based method is also used to obtain the frequencies of factors and observations causing accidents using accident reports. The causal chain and the priorities of the importance of human factors are explored by this hybrid method; the results are consistent with the experience and knowledge of safety management. We discuss the interdependencies between the human factors and the priorities in general, whilst, the specific safety requirements and recommendations in the hoisting and lifting system are also provided as an example. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Analytic network process; Empirical study; Human factors; Oil drilling; Safety assessment,Safety Science,2018,Journal,Sun Z.-Y.; Zhou J.-L.; Gan L.-F.,10.1016/j.ssci.2018.02.004
Examining Cybersecurity of Cyberphysical Systems for Critical Infrastructures Through Work Domain Analysis,"Objective: The aim of this study was to apply work domain analysis for cybersecurity assessment and design of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Background: Adoption of information and communication technology in cyberphysical systems (CPSs) for critical infrastructures enables automated and distributed control but introduces cybersecurity risk. Many CPSs employ SCADA industrial control systems that have become the target of cyberattacks, which inflict physical damage without use of force. Given that absolute security is not feasible for complex systems, cyberintrusions that introduce unanticipated events will occur; a proper response will in turn require human adaptive ability. Therefore, analysis techniques that can support security assessment and human factors engineering are invaluable for defending CPSs. Method: We conducted work domain analysis using the abstraction hierarchy (AH) to model a generic SCADA implementation to identify the functional structures and means–ends relations. We then adopted a case study approach examining the Stuxnet cyberattack by developing and integrating AHs for the uranium enrichment process, SCADA implementation, and malware to investigate the interactions between the three aspects of cybersecurity in CPSs. Results: The AHs for modeling a generic SCADA implementation and studying the Stuxnet cyberattack are useful for mapping attack vectors, identifying deficiencies in security processes and features, and evaluating proposed security solutions with respect to system objectives. Conclusion: Work domain analysis is an effective analytical method for studying cybersecurity of CPSs for critical infrastructures in a psychologically relevant manner. Application: Work domain analysis should be applied to assess cybersecurity risk and inform engineering and user interface design. © 2018, 2018, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",cognitive work analysis; cyberphysical system; cybersecurity; ecological approaches; supervisory control; system analysis; work domain analysis,Human Factors,2018,Journal,Wang H.; Lau N.; Gerdes R.M.,10.1177/0018720818769250
Risk analysis of sequential processes in food industry integrating multi-stage fuzzy cognitive map and process failure mode and effects analysis,"Since managers and staff have not understood the actual consequences of risks in the food industry well, risk management methods practically are limited to identification of the type of risks. In addition, created changes in the business environment have led to change in the attitude of risk management to a process-oriented and systematic view. Because managers cannot decide based on the output of risk management process to implement improvement projects and allocate resources to them. This study has been tried to exactly identify and prioritize potential failures of the production process by using an approach based on the multi-stage Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) method and Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) technique with the help of the cross-functional team. In this approach, failures are prioritized according to the amount of impact of each failure on other failures, as well as the amount of three factors as severity, occurrence, and detection (outputs of PFMEA). This approach considers process-oriented view in manufacturing system through internal-stage and external-stage relationships between production process failures and covers disadvantages of traditional Risk Priority Number (RPN) score such as disregarding internal relationships between failures. Hence, prioritization of potential failures based on the score which includes RPN determinant factors and causal relationships between failures is performed using the multi-stage FCM and learning algorithm based on extended Delta rule. The results of the proposed approach's implementation in an active company in the food industry show that prioritization of failures is closer to reality and presents more full prioritization in comparison with approaches such as traditional RPN. The real case study in the food industry has been used to show the ability of the proposed approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Food industry; Multi-stage fuzzy cognitive map; Process failure mode and effects analysis; Risk assessment; Sequential production processes,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2018,Journal,Jahangoshai Rezaee M.; Yousefi S.; Valipour M.; Dehdar M.M.,10.1016/j.cie.2018.07.012
Patented intelligence: Cloning human decision models for Industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 is a trend related to smart factories, which are cyber-physical spaces populated and controlled by the collective intelligence for the autonomous and highly flexible manufacturing purposes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry. © 2018 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Clone; Cognitive models; Collective intelligence; Cyber-physical system; Decision-making; Industry 4.0; Ontology; Patented intelligence; Pi-Mind; Preference; Smart decision; Value system,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2018,Journal,Terziyan V.; Gryshko S.; Golovianko M.,10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.04.019
Insomnia symptoms and their association with workplace productivity: cross-sectional and pre-post intervention analyses from a large multinational manufacturing company,"Background: Symptoms of insomnia are common and might impact work productivity. We investigated the relationship between insomnia symptoms and workplace productivity in a global manufacturing company. Methods: Within an uncontrolled, cross-sectional study, employees from a US-based company were invited to participate in an online evaluation comprising the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI) measuring symptoms of insomnia (high score indicating better sleep), 2 items of the Work Productivity and Impairment Index (WPAI) measuring ‘presenteeism’ and ‘absenteeism’ (high score indicating loss of work productivity) and 1 item of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) from January 2015 onwards. Pre-post, within-subject data were collected to preliminary test effects of ‘sleep tips’ and digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT). Results: In 2798 employees [72% male; mean age 46.3(SD11.8) yrs] sleep was poorest in plant staff [SCI = 3.70(2.73)], then retail staff [4.34(3.02)], then office staff [4.95(2.83): overall F(2,2786) = 43.7, P <.0001]. More insomnia symptoms were associated with WPAI presenteeism (r = −.489, P <.0001; R2 = 23.9%). Insomnia symptoms also were the strongest predictor of work-related productivity, with stress only contributing a further 9%. A regression model for ‘absenteeism’ was statistically significant but of limited predictive value (R2 = 3.4%). In a sample of 214 employees with pre- and post-intervention data, the SCI of those exposed to sleep tips significantly increased from 5.36(3.28) to 6.01(3.22), [t(123) = −3.02, P =.003] and from 3.08(2.24) to 6.03(2.97) for those who accessed dCBT [t(89) = −8.40, P <.001).

Prototyping proactive and adaptive techniques for human-robot collaboration in manufacturing using virtual reality,"Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has emerged in recent years as a need for common collaborative execution of manufacturing tasks. This work examines two types of techniques of safe collaboration that do not interrupt the flow of collaboration as far as possible, namely proactive and adaptive. The former are materialised using audio and visual cognitive aids, which the user receives as dynamic stimuli in real time during collaboration, and are aimed at information enrichment of the latter. Adaptive techniques investigated refer to the robot; according to the first one of them the robot decelerates when a forthcoming contact with the user is traced, whilst according to the second one the robot retracts and moves to the final destination via a modified, safe trajectory, so as to avoid the human. The effectiveness as well as the activation criteria of the above techniques are investigated in order to avoid possible pointless or premature activation. Such investigation was implemented in a prototype highly interactive and immersive Virtual Environment (VE), in the framework of H-R collaborative hand lay-up process of carbon fabric in an industrial workcell. User tests were conducted, in which both subjective metrics of user satisfaction and performance metrics of the collaboration (task completion duration, robot mean velocity, number of detected human-robot collisions etc.) After statistical processing, results do verify the effectiveness of safe collaboration techniques as well as their acceptability by the user, showing that collaboration performance is affected to a different extent. © 2017",Adaptive trajectory; Collision Avoidance; Human-robot collaboration; Human-robot interaction; Proactive techniques; Safety; Virtual environments,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2018,Journal,Matsas E.; Vosniakos G.-C.; Batras D.,10.1016/j.rcim.2017.09.005
An analysis of language impact on augmented reality order picking training,"Order picking is a difficult and cognitively demanding task. Traditionally textual instructions are helping new workers to learn different picking routines. However, the textual instructions are sometimes not written in the workers' native languages. In the area of Industry 4.0, where digital functions are finding their way into manufacturing processes, language-independent instructions are possible. Through a user study with 15 participants, we compare textual feedback in the workers' native language, textual feedback that is written in an unknown foreign language, and visual Augmented Reality (AR) feedback. We found that AR feedback is significantly faster and leads to a lower perceived cognitive load. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Assistive systems; Augmented reality; Order picking,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2018,Conference,Murauer N.; Schön D.; Müller F.; Pflanz N.; Günther S.; Funk M.,10.1145/3197768.3201570
User experience evaluation model for sustainable manufacturing,"Human factors are fundamental for manufacturing sustainability, which is determined by social, economic and environmental performance. However, there is a lack of engineering methods and tools that are able to integrate their analysis with product and process optimisation according to sustainability principles. The present study proposes an analytical approach to support sustainable manufacturing (SM) by analysing the so-called user experience (UX) of manufacturing and assembly processes starting from the early design stages. Considering both behavioural and cognitive aspects of manufacturing UX and defining a corresponding model, it is possible to estimate the UX impact on manufacturing sustainability for a certain product and its related processes. The proposed method is implemented in a computer-based framework, which can be easily integrated with environmental and cost assessment tools to integrate all three SM aspects. Finally, a case study focused on automated machines is presented; the proposed approach was used to redesign the machine to improve its economic, environmental and human-related impacts. The industrial case study provides concrete evidence of the achievable benefits of applying the proposed model in manufacturing practice. Indeed, the case study demonstrated how the manufacturing and assembly process of a specific machine was optimised by simplifying the product structure, changing the adopted materials and creating more human-centred activities. The new solution is more sustainable due to time savings (−30%), cost reduction (−20%), reduced environmental impact (−25%) and improved UX (+30%). © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",computer-integrated approach; design for manufacturing & assembly (DFMA); human factors; sustainability; user experience,International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,2018,Journal,Peruzzini M.; Pellicciari M.,10.1080/0951192X.2017.1305502
Employees’ financial insecurity and health: The underlying role of stress and work–family conflict appraisals,"Data from two longitudinal samples were utilized to elucidate underlying mechanisms of the well-established relationship between financial insecurity and health outcomes, stemming from the theoretical rationale of conservation of resources and cognitive appraisal theories. Study 1 (n = 80) consisted of low-wage food manufacturing employees working full time, while Study 2 (n = 331) was consisted of a larger, heterogeneous sample of full-time workers representing multiple occupations. Respondents were surveyed on financial insecurity, work-to-family conflict (WFC), stress, and health outcomes at two time periods, 3 months apart. Results across our studies provided support for the direct effects of financial insecurity on WFC and stress. In addition, appraisals of WFC and stress serve as significant mediators of the relationship between financial insecurity and health outcomes, including a significant overall lagged effect across time, and perceived stress accounting for the largest proportion of variance in the lagged relationship among Time 1 financial insecurity and Time 2 health outcomes. Besides support for conservation of resources and cognitive appraisal theories, practically, our studies suggest that workplace initiatives to reduce financial insecurity could positively influence employees’ work–family, stress, and health experiences. Practitioner points: When workers experience financial insecurity, it can have detrimental effects on their health. The effect of financial insecurity on worker health appears to occur because of increased work–family conflict and stress associated with financial insecurity. Direct interventions related to addressing financial insecurity may be challenging, but data suggest there may be a meaningful return-on-investment. © 2018 The British Psychological Society",cognitive appraisals; financial insecurity; low-wage workers; stress; worker health; work–family conflict,Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology,2018,Journal,Odle-Dusseau H.N.; Matthews R.A.; Wayne J.H.,10.1111/joop.12216
Social influence and safe behavior in manufacturing,"This research presents a model designed to explore the cognitive and social mechanisms that mediate the relationship between organizational safety climate and safety behaviors. Specifically the presented research demonstrates the usefulness of Sussmann and Vecchio (1982) social influence interpretation of worker motivation to understand safety motivation. Survey data was collected from 428 employees in seven factories within the electronics industry in China. The data were analyzed using structural modelling. The results suggest that factory workers with more knowledge about the products, organization, goals/objectives and customers of the factory engage in safer work behavior. From social influence theory this may be understood as a process of identification, where factory workers through their involvement and increased knowledge of the factory are socially committed and influenced to work safely via their increased attractiveness of membership in the organization. This complements existing research and shows how other types of knowledge not directly related to safety knowledge may be important for improving safe work behavior. Another finding from the presented research indicate that the total effects of a factory workers experience with safety and health problems seems to affect safe work behavior negatively, and that this is caused by a decrease in confidence and abilities to work safely. In relation to practical implications the present study demonstrate how manufacturing managers can purposely adopt value related; identity related and utility related interpersonal influence processes to influence and improve factory workers commitment to work safely. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Safety behavior; Safety climate; Safety motivation; Social influence theory,Safety Science,2018,Journal,Hald K.S.,10.1016/j.ssci.2018.05.008
Preferred Interaction Styles for Human-Robot Collaboration Vary Over Tasks With Different Action Types,"How do humans want to interact with collaborative robots? As robots become more common and useful not only in industry but also in the home, they will need to interact with humans to complete many varied tasks. Previous studies have demonstrated that autonomous robots are often more efficient and preferred over those that need to be commanded, or those that give instructions to humans. We believe that the types of actions that make up a task affect the preference of participants for different interaction styles. In this work, our goal is to explore tasks with different action types together with different interaction styles to find the specific situations in which different interaction styles are preferred. We have identified several classifications for table-top tasks and have developed a set of tasks that vary along two of these dimensions together with a set of different interaction styles that the robot can use to choose actions. We report on results from a series of human-robot interaction studies involving a PR2 completing table-top tasks with a human. The results suggest that people prefer robot-led interactions for tasks with a higher cognitive load and human-led interactions for joint actions. © Copyright © 2018 Schulz, Kratzer and Toussaint.",collaboration; cooperation; HRI; interaction; joint action; PR2; robotics; shared autonomy,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,2018,Journal,Schulz R.; Kratzer P.; Toussaint M.,10.3389/fnbot.2018.00036
Analysis and Prediction of University Websites Perceptions by Different User Groups,"Users' subjective impressions of websites are actively being researched, as they are formed very early in the interaction and affect the whole subsequent user experience. The subjective visual complexity is known to affect both website users' cognitive load and overall affective impressions. In our work we construct artificial neural network model to predict users' perceptions of selected universities' websites without the actual users. To train the network, we joined the two kinds of data that we specially collected. The visual complexity-related metrics of websites were extracted from web interface screenshots by our dedicated visual analyzer software implementing the 'human-computer vision' approach. The assessments of the homepages orderliness and overall complexity were collected from 61 human annotators of different ages and cultural/national groups. We were able to achieve moderate subjective perceptions prediction accuracy, with relative error of 73.0%. The analysis of the factors' importance suggests that the proposed index of visual-spatial complexity had considerably higher importance than the baseline frequency-based entropy measure for images. The results of our work can aid in controlling the visual complexity perception in website visitors, ultimately contributing to better web usability. © 2018 IEEE.",computer vision; neural networks; user satisfaction; visual complexity; Web interfaces,"2018 14th International Scientific-Technical Conference on Actual Problems of Electronic Instrument Engineering, APEIE 2018 - Proceedings",2018,Conference,Bakaev M.A.; Laricheva T.A.; Heil S.; Gaedke M.,10.1109/APEIE.2018.8545807
A taxonomy of performance shaping factors for shield tunnel construction,"Purpose: On shield tunnel construction (STC) site, human error is widely recognized as essential to accident. It is necessary to explain which factors lead to human error and how these factors can influence human performance. Human reliability analysis supports such necessity through modeling the performance shaping factors (PSFs). The purpose of this paper is to establish and validate a PSF taxonomy for the STC context. Design/methodology/approach: The approach taken in this study mainly consists of three steps. First, a description of the STC context is proposed through the analysis of the STC context. Second, the literature which stretch across the PSF methodologies, cognitive psychology and human factors of STC and other construction industries are reviewed to develop an initial set of PSFs. Finally, a final PSF set is modified and validated based on STC task analysis and STC accidents cases. Findings: The PSF taxonomy constituted by 4 main components, 4 hierarchies and 85 PSFs is established for human behavior modeling and simulation under the STC context. Furthermore, by comparing and evaluating the performance of STC PSF and existing PSF studies, the proposed PSF taxonomy meets the requirement for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Practical implications: The PSF taxonomy can provide a basis and support for human behavior modeling and simulation under the STC context. Integrating PSFs into a behavior simulation model provides a more realistic and integrated assessment of human error by manifesting the influence of each PSFs on the cognitive processes. The simulation results can suggest concrete points for the improvement of STC safety management. Originality/value: This paper develops a taxonomy of PSFs that addresses the various unique influences of the STC context on human behaviors. The harsh underground working conditions and diverse resources of system information are identified as key characteristics of the STC context. Furthermore, the PSF taxonomy can be integrated into a human cognitive behavior model to predict the worker’s behavior on STC site in future work. © 2018, Jue Li, Minghui Yu and Hongwei Wang.",Human error; Performance shaping factors; Safety behaviour; Shield tunnel construction,"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management",2018,Journal,Li J.; Yu M.; Wang H.,10.1108/ECAM-06-2016-0155
Efficiency measurement of IT support for information retrieval at manual workplaces,"The increasing demand to customize vehicles and thus the higher product variety affects the workplaces at the automobile industry. The work tasks become more complex due to an increasing information density and modern production technologies, i.e. robots, linked production facilities and the progress towards the digitalization of production steps. Assistive information systems, that provide relevant information to the worker, have been widely researched, but there is little research on evaluating working stations beforehand regarding their potential of implementing assistive systems. Within this paper, we propose a modified application of a standard evaluation method for comparing different representatives of assistive systems, i.e. paper instructions, IT glasses and hand-held devices. Based on a user study at a manual assembly workplace, we compare these assistive systems. Using the Methods-Time Measurement method for comparison, our results reveal that the IT glass and the tablet, as the representatives for IT-supported systems, lead to significant faster task completions and significant differences in the information processes compared to the paper-based instructions. Additional questionnaires concerning the cognitive load and the assessment of the assistive systems regarding the ease of use, level of satisfaction and performance, support the previous findings. © 2018 IEEE.",Assistive Systems; Evaluation Methods; Hand-held Devices; Information Processes; IT glasses; Manufacturing; Methods-Time Measurement (MTM); NASA-TLX,"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems, ICPS 2018",2018,Conference,Kubenke J.C.; Kunz A.,10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390768
Human factors’ complexity measurement of human-based station of assembly line,"Cognitive heterogeneity causes operation time variability and high human error rates at human-based stations of assembly lines. It will affect the performance of the production activities, the design process of which depends on reliable estimate of operation time. To quantify operator cognition, we measured the human factors’ complexity of human-based stations using an information entropy approach in aspect of operation time. Initially, the influence of the operators’ cognition on the operation time is analyzed. Based on the analysis, the operation time model that considers cognition is presented. Then, the operation time model is modified by applying a correction method using the behavior correction factor, and, finally, the human factors’ complexity measurement model is built. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method in order to measure the influence of human cognition on the performance of the human-based station. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",assembly line; complexity measurement; human cognition; human factors; human-based station,Human Factors and Ergonomics In Manufacturing,2018,Journal,Fan G.; Li A.; Zhao Y.; Moroni G.; Xu L.,10.1002/hfm.20738
Towards human-based industrial cyber-physical systems,"The constant advances in sciences and technologies encourage industrialist and researchers in manufacturing, to address new challenges relevant to industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Human aspects, among others, are of importance and researchers try to take them into account, but they remain to be efficiently dealt with during the design of industrial CPS. The goal of this paper is to highlight how it is possible to integrate 'human-in-the-loop' inside the process control of industrial CPS. For that purpose, studies coming from the domain of industrial engineering are presented in the next part. It is completed by an overview of the main cognitive dimensions industrial designers have to integrate in assistance systems definition in order to benefit from human competencies and capacities while respecting human limits. The main idea is to balance Human and technology involvement, taking advantage of industrial CPS advances and Human capabilities identified and implemented through Human-Machine Cooperation principles. The project HUMANISM, which is presented, aims to specify and experiment such principles. © 2018 IEEE.",Adaptive level of automation; Collaborative robotics; Cyber-physical systems; Human-machine cooperation; Intelligent manufacturing systems; Multi-agent systems,"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems, ICPS 2018",2018,Conference,Pacaux-Lemoine M.-P.; Berdal Q.; Enjalbert S.; Trentesaux D.,10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390776
Modeling agents as joint cognitive systems in smart manufacturing systems,"Latest innovations and developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as well as Operational Technologies (OTs) are changing manufacturing forever. Ideas such as Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are attempting to impact, even dictate those changes. In this paper, we focus on the changes to the role of humans in their interactions with those innovations, known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and Industry 4.0 technologies. We review the current interaction model based on Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), and we propose a new model based on the engineering of Joint Cognitive Systems (JCS). Then, we discuss some of the implications of this new model for the modelling and control of smart manufacturing systems. © 2018",Collaborative agents; Control; Human-machine interfaces; Joint cognitive systems; Smart manufacturing systems,Manufacturing Letters,2018,Journal,Jones A.T.; Romero D.; Wuest T.,10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.06.002

Prior knowledge of category size impacts visual search,"Prior research has shown that category search can be similar to one-item search (as measured by the N2pc ERP marker of attentional selection) for highly familiar, smaller categories (e.g., letters and numbers) because the finite set of items in a category can be grouped into one unit to guide search. Other studies have shown that larger, more broadly defined categories (e.g., healthy food) also can elicit N2pc components during category search, but the amplitude of these components is typically attenuated. Two experiments investigated whether the perceived size of a familiar category impacts category and exemplar search. We presented participants with 16 familiar company logos: 8 from a smaller category (social media companies) and 8 from a larger category (entertainment/recreation manufacturing companies). The ERP results from Experiment 1 revealed that, in a two-item search array, search was more efficient for the smaller category of logos compared to the larger category. In a four-item search array (Experiment 2), where two of the four items were placeholders, search was largely similar between the category types, but there was more attentional capture by nontarget members from the same category as the target for smaller rather than larger categories. These results support a growing literature on how prior knowledge of categories affects attentional selection and capture during visual search. We discuss the implications of these findings in relation to assessing cognitive abilities across the lifespan, given that prior knowledge typically increases with age. © 2018 Society for Psychophysiological Research",categorization; N2pc; prior knowledge; visual search,Psychophysiology,2018,Journal,Wu R.; McGee B.; Echiverri C.; Zinszer B.D.,10.1111/psyp.13075

Trust in organization as a moderator of the relationship between self-efficacy and workplace outcomes: A social cognitive theory-based examination,"Drawing on a social cognitive theory perspective, we contend that an employee's trust in oneself, or self-efficacy, will interact with the individual's trust in the system, or trust in organization, to predict job attitudes and behaviours. Specifically, we expected that self-efficacy would have stronger effects on job attitudes (job satisfaction and turnover intentions) and behaviours (task performance and organizational citizenship behaviours) to the degree to which employees perceive high levels of trust in organization. Using data collected from 300 employees and their respective supervisors at a manufacturing organization in Turkey across three waves, we found that self-efficacy had more positive effects on job satisfaction, task performance, and citizenship behaviours when trust in organization was high. Interestingly, self-efficacy had a positive effect on turnover intentions when trust in organization was low, indicating that high trust in organization buffered the effects of self-efficacy on intentions to leave. The results suggest that the motivational value of trust in oneself is stronger to the degree to which employees also have high trust in the system, whereas low trust in system neutralizes the motivational benefits of self-efficacy. Practitioner points: Practicing managers should not only invest in increasing self-efficacy of their employees, but also invest in building trust to improve employees’ attitudes, behaviours, and performance. This is because when employee trust in organization is high, employee self-efficacy has greater potential to have a positive influence over job satisfaction, task performance, and organizational citizenship behaviours. Self-efficacy may actually increase an employee's desire to leave the organization when organizational conditions are unfavourable, such as in the case of low trust in the organization. Practicing managers should be aware that employees who have high levels of confidence may be at higher risk of turnover when they are unhappy with the organization. © 2017 The British Psychological Society",employee performance; job satisfaction; role breadth self-efficacy; self-efficacy; social cognitive theory; trust in organization; turnover intentions,Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology,2018,Journal,Ozyilmaz A.; Erdogan B.; Karaeminogullari A.,10.1111/joop.12189

What makes firms innovative? The role of social capital in corporate innovation,"This paper offers a social capital explanation for the purported relationship between human capital investment and an organization's innovation capability. We argue that social capital plays a mediating role in the relationship between the level of individual knowledge of employees and organizations' innovation capabilities. The mediating mechanism is attributed to the role of social capital in knowledge exchange and combination that help enhance knowledge creation. Using survey data of 319 manufacturing firms in Korea, we conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis to verify the mediating role of social capital in firms' innovation performance. The results demonstrated that relational and cognitive dimensions of social capital are important mediators in realizing organizational innovation performance. © 2017 by the authors.",Human capital investment; Innovation capability; Knowledge creation; Social capital,Sustainability (Switzerland),2017,Journal,Ahn S.-Y.; Kim S.-H.,10.3390/su9091564
A framework to design a human-centred adaptive manufacturing system for aging workers,"The so-called smart manufacturing systems (SMS) combine smart manufacturing technologies, cyber-physical infrastructures, and data control to realize predictive and adaptive behaviours. In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 45–64 years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers’ needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers’ wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers’ skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Adaptive manufacturing systems; Aging workers; Cyber-physical systems; Human factors; Smart manufacturing systems; Usability,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2017,Journal,Peruzzini M.; Pellicciari M.,10.1016/j.aei.2017.02.003
Transparent role assignment and task allocation in human robot collaboration,"Collaborative robots represent a clear added value to manufacturing, as they promise to increase productivity and improve working conditions of such environments. Although modern robotic systems have become safe and reliable enough to operate close to human workers on a day-to-day basis, the workload is still skewed in favor of a limited contribution from the robot's side, and a significant cognitive load is allotted to the human. We believe the transition from robots as recipients of human instruction to robots as capable collaborators hinges around the implementation of transparent systems, where mental models about the task are shared between peers, and the human partner is freed from the responsibility of taking care of both actors. In this work, we implement a transparent task planner able to be deployed in realistic, near-future applications. The proposed framework is capable of basic reasoning capabilities for what concerns role assignment and task allocation, and it interfaces with the human partner at the level of abstraction he is most comfortable with. The system is readily available to non-expert users, and programmable with high-level commands in an intuitive interface. Our results demonstrate an overall improvement in terms of completion time, as well as a reduced cognitive load for the human partner. © 2017 IEEE.",,Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation,2017,Conference,Roncone A.; Mangin O.; Scassellati B.,10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989122
Augmented reality device operator cognitive strain determination and prediction,"Augmented reality (AR) solutions are in the process of entering a broad variety of industries to modify the capabilities of workers through (close to) real-time display of context-dependent information. An example for real-time training is the display of instructional materials, such as manuals, for operation and maintenance. Especially in industrial settings, this will allow for the enhancement of workforce capabilities in real-time. However, little is known with respect to the cognitive load that is incurred as a result of this process, which might hinder the realization of desired outcomes. In this paper, we evaluate visual tasks with respect to the cognitive load based on electroencephalography (EEG) employing existing and new metrics utilizing a publicly available data set. In turn, we provide an initial quantified and directly measured approach. We find that overall results are highly subjective, but already available commercial equipment can readily be employed to determine the cognitive load with R2 scores around 0.5 when utilizing k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) approaches directly. More intricate metrics at different measurement points could thus help detect and alleviate undesired stressors in industrial augmented reality settings. © 2017 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press",Augmented reality; Cognitive load; Electroencephalography; K-nearest-neighbor; Multimedia systems,AIMS Electronics and Electrical Engineering,2017,Journal,Seeling P.,10.3934/ElectrEng.2017.1.100
Ergonomics evaluation of game interface design provisions on various computer based monitor screens,"Nowadays, gaming has grown rapidly into one of the things that exist in everyday human life. Starting from the previous game which is only a means of solace, now has become a means with many other functions, for example, learning and business objects. Changing times and technology has also pushed the development of games in the world to increase rapidly. Games industry and business development is no longer a rare thing, but is now becoming a promising business potential. Unfortunately, not all things only have positive sides. Game is something that gives fun but also has an addictive tendency that if played inappropriately, can have effects on health, whether bad or not. This study aims to evaluate the ergonomics side of game related to the user interface design and monitor screen. Evaluation is done by providing a task scenario in the game that needs to be solved with a case study on computer gaming. The methods used include performance metrics, Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), NASA TLX questionnaires, Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS), and eye tracking.

Construction of Safety Competency Evaluation System for High-Risk Industry,"In order to evaluate the competency of high risk industry position, this paper puts forward the concept of safety competency. We evaluated over two thousand practitioners in high-risk industry by using human factors assessment instruments and psychological evaluation scale. And through the preliminary practice and theoretical research, a large number of literature review and evaluation indicators were selected. Finally, the evaluation system of high-risk industry safety competency is constructed from the aspects of cognitive ability, physiological function and psychological characteristics, and the applicability of each index is expounded. This paper puts forward the evaluation system of high risk industry safety competency assessment results and grade classification, which can be used as guidance for high-risk industries' post entry criteria and security control measures.

Development of a learning factory concept to train participants regarding digital and human centered decision support,"Cyber-physical systems lead to an emerging quantity and quality of data that can be collected and processed within the whole production process. [1] This data helps to rationalize and optimize the production planning as well as the operative level. In order to handle this amount of complex information, digital support systems are required. Besides assistant systems, crosslinking of data and machines within a company is one of the central aspects of Industrie 4.0. In a round based training concept the connection between manufacturing execution systems and assistant systems will be explained. Furthermore the changes of work caused by decision support systems as well as the functionalities of assistance systems will be included in the new training concept. Assistant systems can be divided into cognitive and physical assistance. [2] In this article we focus on cognitive assistance. It has perceiving functions and the decision support function because there will be an increasing incidence in the future due to a higher amount of data. To support this theory research results from the project SOPHIE regarding digital and human centered decision support systems will be used.

The evaluation of an elementary virtual training system for manual assembly,"Due to the low volume high variety strategies of manufacturing companies, manual assembly operators have a much larger cognitive load than before. The expertise of the operators must be kept up to date at any time. Since the high investment and low flexibility of a real setting to perform a manual assembly training, a virtual replica is introduced in many cases. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of an elementary virtual training for manual assembly tasks. In literature, different studies on the topic can be found; nevertheless, a comparison between the different studies is not possible due to diverse evaluation methods and descriptions. A benchmark for a uniform evaluation of virtual training systems is presented and applied to this experiment. Two groups were submitted to a number of manual assembly tasks. The test group got a virtual training period in advance. A significant learning transfer during that training period was observed. When the first assembly of the reference group is counted as a real training, no significant difference can be found between the virtual and real training. The outcomes of this experiment will be used in future work to compare different virtual training systems and influential factors such as the assembly complexity. Furthermore, the application of virtual training to manual assembly in a mixed-model environment and its industrial usability are topics that still need to be studied. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Learning effect; Manual assembly; Virtual manufacturing; Virtual reality; Virtual training,International Journal of Production Research,2017,Journal,Hoedt S.; Claeys A.; Van Landeghem H.; Cottyn J.,10.1080/00207543.2017.1374572
Implementing human factors in oil and gas drilling and completion operations: Enhancing culture of process safety,"The role of Human Factors, in complex environments like the oil and gas industry, has seen a paradigm shift over a very short span of time recently. Past studies have limited focus on the human system interfacial approach. However, the repeated failures have forced the industry and academia to take a closer look at the cascading failures with human errors perspective and conduct the root-cause analysis from the cognitive aspect. Traditionally, the knowledge, expertize, and competence took the driving seat while the human factors had been on the back burner. Lack of emphasis on Human Factors in academic research could be another reason for this laxity. Consideration of human factors in the design of systems is centered on the end user. Systems are designed to fit the physiological limitations of the people tasked with managing them. The design includes features that improve comfort and productivity, minimize errors, and minimize training time. In this paper, first a review of crucial human factors in different well cycles such as drilling, well completion, fracturing, and abandonment will be presented. Through various cases studies, it will be shown that potential challenges can be mitigated with proper implementation of various elements for human factors such as situational awareness, team working, stress management and other non-technical skills. In addition, this paper reviews the critical components and perceived gaps of existing safety management systems in use as well as those elements that would be of most value to drilling taken from other sectors or industries on a 'first principles' basis. The paper attempts to highlight 'the myths, misconceptions, and realities of complex well operations' that either deter changes or demand a new approach. It is the authors premise that if either a 'clean sheet' approach or more 'actual cost' weight was given to both common problems and low probability high consequence events such as kicks or loss of well control. © 2018 ASME.",,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,2018,Conference,Kiran R.; Salehi S.; Teodoriu C.,10.1115/OMAE2018-78431
A mixed-reality digital set-up to support design for serviceability,"Design for serviceability begins with understanding the customer needs related to availability, reliability, accessibility and visibility, and aims at designing optimized systems where maintenance operations are easy and intuitive in order to reduce the time to repair and service costs. However, service actions are difficult to predict in front of a traditional CAD model. In this context, digital manufacturing tools and virtual simulation technologies can be validly used to create mixed digital environments where service tasks can be simulated in advance to support product design and improve maintenance actions. Furthermore, the use of human monitoring sensors can be used to detect the stressful conditions and to optimize the human tasks. The paper proposes a mixed reality (MR) set-up where operators are digitalized and monitored to analyse both physical and cognitive ergonomics. It is useful to predict design criticalities and improve the global system design. An industrial case study has been developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial to demonstrate how the proposed set-up is used for design for serviceability, on the basis of experimental evidence. © 2018 The Authors.",Design for serviceability; Digital Manufacturing (DM); Ergonomics; Human-Centred Design (HCD); Sustainability; Virtual Simulation,Procedia Manufacturing,2018,Conference,Peruzzini M.; Grandi F.; Pellicciari M.; Campanella C.E.,10.1016/j.promfg.2018.10.089
Semiautonomous dual-arm mobile manipulator system with intuitive supervisory user interfaces,"This paper presents the VaultBot dual-arm mobile manipulator and its integration with Robot Operating System, MoveIt!, and RViz, and thus demonstrate how two chronic issues with similar systems were addressed: overly complex integration and user control. Multiple levels of semi-autonomous control were developed for the base, manipulator(s), and coordinated motions involving both. Lower levels of autonomy are always available to increase operator comfort. In order to combat cognitive load increases from context switching the control methods take a human-centered approach by automatically adjusting perspective to keep tasks visualized relative to the operator. Sensor data is fused into a single window alongside the current robot state. These approaches are considered highly intuitive and can be used as effectively as socially well-established mouse-based interactive markers for teleoperation in even high-precision tasks. © 2017 IEEE.",High-precision; Industrial manipulators; Levels of autonomy; ROS; ROS-I; Scalable; Semi-autonomous behavoirs,"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts, ARSO",2017,Conference,Sharp A.; Kruusamae K.; Ebersole B.; Pryor M.,10.1109/ARSO.2017.8025195
Metal additive manufacturing: Cost competitive beyond low volumes,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is increasingly of interest for commercial and military applications due to its potential to create novel geometries with increased performance. For additive manufacturing to find commercial application, it must be cost competitive against traditional processes such as forging. Forecasting the production costs of future products prior to large-scale investment is challenging due to the limits of traditional cost accounting's ability to handle both the systemic process implications of new technologies and the cognitive biases in humans' additive and systemic estimates. Leveraging a method uniquely suited to these challenges, we quantify the production and use economics of an additively manufactured versus a traditionally forged GE engine bracket of equivalent performance for commercial aviation. Our results show that, despite the simplicity of the engine bracket, when taking into account the part redesign for AM and the associated lifetime fuel savings of the additively designed bracket, the additively manufactured part and design is cheaper than the forged one for a wide range of scenarios, including at higher volumes of 2000-12,000 brackets per year. Opportunities to further reduce costs include accessing lower material prices without compromising quality, producing vertical builds with equivalent performance to horizontal builds, and increasing process control so as to enable reduced testing. Given the conservative nature of our assumptions as well as our choice of part, these results suggest that there may be broader economic viability for additively manufactured parts, especially when systemic factors and use costs are incorporated. © 2017 by ASME.",additive manufacturing; aerospace; forging; metal alloys; process based cost modeling,"Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, Transactions of the ASME",2017,Journal,Laureijs R.E.; Roca J.B.; Narra S.P.; Montgomery C.; Beuth J.L.; Fuchs E.R.H.,10.1115/1.4035420
Exploring the notion of situation for responsive manufacturing systems specification issues,"Responsiveness in manufacturing is a key challenge for facing open-ended changes more and more enhanced by the increasing development of easy-to-use digital technologies. However, the control of a given situation into wholeness by a respondent system is raising design issues to make cooperating together the many entities of the Human, digital and physical parts interleaved in a related world-of-interest in order to reach and maintain common goals. This paper provides an overview of some relevant works for attaining a situated perspective of the responsiveness of a system to be engineered with simplexity.

Toward Parallel Consciousness: Classifying User State to Improve Augmentation Relevance,"In recent years, see-through display technology has begun to reach a point where we will have the ability to continuously display virtual information in a variety of real world situations. However, augmented reality (AR) interfaces are currently limited in their ability to interact with the wearer and environment to provide specific, safe, and useful information when needed. Moreover, many questions remain about how to make content more relevant, especially in dynamic applications like rescue or manufacturing. By overcoming these issues, visual perception and cognition can potentially be enhanced past innate human ability. This paper describes the notion of Parallel Consciousness, the thought that technology can function as an extension of human memory and cognition, and outlines a framework to implement such an interface using AR. This involves understanding both the environment and user's mental and visual states to more effectively augment vision, and managing the retrieval of content to improve enhancements and assist both cognitive function and memory. To achieve these goals, we are exploring unique combinations of eye tracking and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help monitor user attention and cognitive state. We hypothesize that by using these resulting states in conjunction with environmental analysis, we can better automate the retrieval and merge of virtual content into a user's view. © 2017 IEEE.",augmented reality; cognitive state; eye tracking,"Proceedings - 2017 International Symposium on Ubiquitous Virtual Reality, ISUVR 2017",2017,Conference,Orlosky J.,10.1109/ISUVR.2017.19
Electronic freightcar inspection recordingand application of Internet-of-Things (IOT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) frameworks,"Freight railroad classification yards have been compared to large-scale manufacturing plants, with inbound trains as the inputs and outbound trains as the outputs. Railcars often take up to 24 hours to be processed through a railyard due to the need for manual inbound inspection, car classification, manual outbound inspection, and other intermediate processes. Much of the inspection and repair process has historically been completed manually with handwritten documents. Until recently, car inspections were rarely documented unless repairs were required. Currently, when a defect is detected in the yard, the railcar inspector must complete a ""bad order"" form that is adhered to each side of the car. This process may take up to ten minutes per bad order. To reduce labor costs and improve efficiency, asset management technology and Internet-of-Things (IoT) frameworks can now be developed to reduce labor time needed to record bad orders, increase inspection visibility, and provide the opportunity to implement analytics and cognitive insights to optimize worker productivity and facilitate condition-based maintenance. The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost prototype electronic freight car inspection tracking system for small-scale (short line and regional) railroad companies. This system allows car inspectors to record mechanical inspection data using a ruggedized mobile platform (e.g. tablet or smartphone). This data may then be used to improve inspection quality and efficiency as well as reduce inspection redundancy. Data collection will involve two approaches. The first approach is the development of an Android-based mobile application to electronically record and store inspection data using a smartphone or rugged tablet. This automates the entire bad order form process by connecting to IBM's Bluemix Cloudant NoSQL database. It allows for the information to be accessed by railroad mechanical managers or car owners, anywhere and at any time. The second approach is a web-based Machine-to-Machine (M2M) system using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and beacon technology to store car inspection data on a secure website and/or a cloudant database. This approach introduces the freight car inspection process to the ""physical web,"" and it will offer numerous additional capabilities that are not possible with the current radio frequency identification device (RFID) system used for freight car tracking. By connecting railcars to the physical web, railcar specifications and inspection data can be updated in real-time and be made universally available. At the end of this paper, an evaluation and assessment is made of both the benefits and drawbacks of each of these approaches. The evaluation suggests that although some railroads may immediately benefit from these technological solutions, others may be better off with the current manual method until IoT and M2M become more universally accepted within the railroad industry. The primary value of this analysis is to provide a decision framework for railroads seeking to implement IoT systems in their freight car inspection practices. As an additional result, the software and IoT source code for the mobile app developed for this project will be open source to promote future collaboration within the industry.

Designing intelligent manufacturing systems through Human-Machine Cooperation principles: A human-centered approach,"Since the start of industrialization, machine capabilities have increased in such a way that human control of processes has evolved from simple (with mechanization) to cognitive (with computerization), and even emotional (with semi/full automation). The processes have also evolved from simple to complicated, and now complex systems, in the emerging context of Industry 4.0. This is notably the case with Intelligent Manufacturing Systems in which processes have become so autonomous that humans are unaware of the processes running, while they may need to intervene to update the manufacturing plan or modify the process configuration if a machine breaks down, or to assist process-intelligent entities when they find themselves in a deadlock. This paper highlights the lack of attention paid to the correct integration of humans in Intelligent Manufacturing Systems and provides solutions based on Human-Machine Cooperation principles to retain humans in the process control loop with different levels of involvement identified by the levels of automation. The aim of these principles is to propose a human-centered approach to design and evaluate systems, processes, and their interactions with humans. Herein, these principles are detailed and applied to Intelligent Manufacturing Systems using Artificial Self-Organizing systems (ASO) as an example. An assistance system was designed to support cooperation between ASO and human operators. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system and its utility in improving the performance of Human-Machine Systems, as well as its acceptability with regard to human factors. The results presented highlight the advantages of the approach within the context of Industry 4.0. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Human-centered design; Human-Machine Cooperation; Industry 4.0; Intelligent manufacturing systems; Levels of automation; Techno-centered design,Computers and Industrial Engineering,2017,Journal,Pacaux-Lemoine M.-P.; Trentesaux D.; Zambrano Rey G.; Millot P.,10.1016/j.cie.2017.05.014
Cognitive shape similarity assessment for 3D part search,"Mass customization aims to satisfy diverse customer requirements with high product variety while maintaining reasonable manufacturing cost and lead time. Allowing customers to perceive product differentiation is a critical factor for most design methods developed for mass customization. This study examines 3D part search from the human cognitive perspective. We designed and conducted a quasi-factorial experiment to understand how structured variations of four factors—the shape, type, dimension, and location of the feature volume of a part model—affect human judgment of part similarity. The corresponding factorial similarity values were computed with different shape signatures in the form of the feature adjacency graph. The human responses were obtained by paired comparisons of test parts, and quantified as the cognitive similarity. Statistical analysis of the experimental results showed that the type and shape factors played an important role in the subjects’ judgments. Back-propagation neural networks were trained to model the correlations between the cognitive and the factorial similarity values. The performance of the networks validates our idea of incorporating human cognition into assessment of 3D part similarity. This study presents a systematic approach for personalized part search that reflects individual perception of shape similarity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Part search; Part similarity; Product variety; Shape cognition,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,2017,Journal,Chu C.-H.; Lo C.-H.; Cheng H.-C.,10.1007/s10845-016-1211-4
Effectiveness and acceptability of a virtual environment for assessing human–robot collaboration in manufacturing,"A highly immersive and interactive virtual environment was constructed as an experimentation platform for human–robot collaboration in constricting panels from preimpregnated carbon fibre fabrics. The application involves highly collaborative tasks such as handover, removal of adhesive backing strip and fabric layup in a mould. Furthermore, the user is expected to be most of the time within the robot’s workspace, jointly working as teammates on collaborative manufacturing tasks. The environment embeds two interaction metaphors for complex tasks and advocates use of cognitive aids to cultivate proactive behaviour of the user, thus promoting situation awareness, danger perception and enrichment of communication between human and robot. The application was put under test by a group of users. Their experience was registered scholarly through questionnaires and objective observation and is reported in the paper to explore the effectiveness and acceptability of such an environment. Overall, the application was judged positively, especially the use of cognitive aids which, under circumstances turned into alarms and readily provided mental association of collision danger to its cause. Furthermore, some deficiencies were identified pertaining to lack of hand-tracking performance and need to improve the layup metaphor. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",Cognitive aids; Composites manufacturing; Human–robot collaboration; Interaction metaphors; Situation awareness; Virtual environment,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2017,Journal,Matsas E.; Vosniakos G.-C.; Batras D.,10.1007/s00170-017-0428-5
Supporting adaptiveness of cyber-physical processes through action-based formalisms,"Cyber Physical Processes (CPPs) refer to a new generation of business processes enacted in many application environments (e.g., emergency management, smart manufacturing, etc.), in which the presence of Internet-of-Things devices and embedded ICT systems (e.g., smartphones, sensors, actuators) strongly influences the coordination of the real-world entities (e.g., humans, robots, etc.) inhabitating such environments. A Process Management System (PMS) employed for executing CPPs is required to automatically adapt its running processes to anomalous situations and exogenous events by minimising any human intervention. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing an approach and an adaptive Cognitive PMS, called SmartPM, which combines process execution monitoring, unanticipated exception detection and automated resolution strategies leveraging on three well-established action-based formalisms developed for reasoning about actions in Artificial Intelligence (AI), including the situation calculus, IndiGolog and automated planning. Interestingly, the use of SmartPM does not require any expertise of the internal working of the AI tools involved in the system. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Upper Extremity Muscle Activity during In-Phase and Anti-Phase Continuous Pushing Tasks,"Objective: To determine the effect of anti-phase, in-phase bimanual and unimanual simulated industrial pushing tasks and frequency on upper extremity muscle activity. Background: Research investigating symmetrical (in-phase) and asymmetrical (anti-phase) pushing exertions is limited despite a high prevalence in industry. Methods: Fifteen female participants completed five pushing tasks using a dual handle apparatus at three frequencies: 15 cycles per minute (cpm), 30 cpm, and self-selected. Tasks included two bimanual symmetrical pushes (constrained and unconstrained), two bimanual asymmetrical pushes (reciprocating and continuous), and one right unimanual push. Surface electromyography (EMG) from the right anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid (AD, MD, and PD); right and left trapezius (RT and LT); right pectoralis major (PM); and right and left external obliques (REO and LEO) was collected and normalized to maximum voluntary effort. Results: There was a task by frequency interaction in the AD, MD, PD, and RT (p <.005), where activity in AD, MD, and PD was highest in the continuous task at 15 cpm, but activity was similar across task in 30 cpm and self-selected. Muscle activity coefficient of variation was lowest during continuous task across all frequencies. Conclusion: Continuous, anti-phase pushes and constrained, in-phase pushes had the highest muscle activity demands and the least amount of variability in muscle activity and therefore may present the greatest risk of injury. Application: Anti-phase pushing is known to have a greater cognitive demand, and this study demonstrated that it also has a greater physical demand when performed continuously. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",coordinated action; electromyography; repetition; work-related musculoskeletal disorders,Human Factors,2017,Journal,Gruevski K.M.; Hodder J.N.; Keir P.J.,10.1177/0018720817714367
A haptic quality control method based on the human somatosensory system,"The sense of touch is probably the most complex human sense, because it involves a very large number of sensory receptors spread over the whole body, and takes at the same time full advantage of the human nervous system complexity and power. Although this complexity enables us to perceive the world around us and interact with it, it is also a great source of variability when it comes to controlling the quality of products in a manufacturing environment. Indeed, human subjectivity and preferences, as well as the level of cognitive charge, directly influence the performance of a controller, thus impacting the resulting quality of accepted products, as well as the related economical costs and costumer satisfaction level. We address this issue through three propositions that aim at managing the sense of touch in the context of industrial quality control. (1) The proposed formalization of haptic sensations simplifies the description vocabulary and avoids confusing sensations mix. Nine generic elementary sensations were extracted from a semantic analysis of usual descriptors, and used to define generic haptic anomalies. (2) The modelling of the influence of exploration conditions on haptic perception enables to set common and coherent ways to touch objects. (3) The structuring of the control process is inspired by previous studies in visual quality control. It was applied to the sense of touch and adapted to its specificities. In particular, an intelligent decision method based on the exploration model is proposed, to improve the performance of quality control, and reduce the cognitive charge of controllers for them to focus on perceived sensations. This paper presents the solutions proposed in order to solve the problems associated with the use of the human somatosensory system as a measurement system, while minimizing the variability of quality control decisions. © 2017 IEEE.",,"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Virtual Environments for Measurement Systems and Applications, CIVEMSA 2017 - Proceedings",2017,Conference,Albert B.; Maire J.-L.; Pillet M.; Zanni-Merk C.; De Beuvron F.D.B.; Charrier J.; Knecht C.,10.1109/CIVEMSA.2017.7995315
Measures of mental alertness of construction workers to enhance job site safety,"The construction industry is among the most dangerous industries, as one in five worker deaths is related to construction job sites. Construction projects are unique in nature with different rationales and requirements. There are safety issues within each step of the construction phase at each project. This study aims to include factors of uncertainty such as performance of construction workers and their state of alertness in their work conditions in response to external stimuli. To address the relationship between human factors and safety concerns at job sites, an exploratory study was conducted to evaluate which factors impact a worker's perception of the jobsite and how these factors can be used to predict and decrease jobsite accidents. This study is a multidisciplinary project and combines three different domains including construction management, construction safety, and cognitive psychology, to evaluate workers' perceptions of safety hazards based on their mental alertness. This study is proposed as a pilot study and will pave the way for the further implementation of mental alertness measures at construction projects. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Expert knowledge elicitation to generate human factors guidance for future European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) train driving models,"The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) will have an impact on the train driving task and the behaviour of the train drivers. This paper presents a part of the final study of the series of studies that have been conducted as part of a three-year research project, which investigated the effects of ERTMS on the behaviour of the train drivers. In recent times, a number of models of train driving have been developed in order to inform the design of the train driving technology and understand the implications of the design of the train driving task on the performance of the drivers and their behaviour. An expert knowledge elicitation study was conducted to evaluate the existing train driving models and to generate a guidance on human factors for the future ERTMS train driving models. The study consisted of a workshop, which was conducted using the rail human factor experts who have been directly involved with the projects examining ERTMS. The current train driving models were evaluated and ideas were generated as to how these should be shaped in the future to include systems such as ERTMS. The findings of the study contributed to bridging the gap between the theoretical understanding of the cognitive strategies of the train drivers and the practical implementation of novel technologies by the rail industry. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.",European Rail Traffic Management System; human factors; Train driving,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit",2017,Journal,Naghiyev A.; Sharples S.; Ryan B.; Coplestone A.; Carey M.,10.1177/0954409717695902
Missing focus on Human Factors - Organizational and cognitive ergonomics - In the safety management for the petroleum industry,"More attention has recently been given to Human Factors in petroleum accident investigations. The Human Factors areas examined in this article are organizational, cognitive and physical ergonomics. A key question to be explored is as follows: To what degree are the petroleum industry and safety authorities in Norway focusing on these Human Factors areas from the design phase? To investigate this, we conducted an innovative exploratory study of the development of four control centres in Norwegian oil and gas industry in collaboration between users, management and Human Factors experts. We also performed a literature survey and discussion with the professional Human Factors network in Norway. We investigated the Human Factors focus, reasons for not considering Human Factors and consequences of missing Human Factors in safety management. The results revealed an immature focus and organization of Human Factors. Expertise on organizational ergonomics and cognitive ergonomics are missing from companies and safety authorities and are poorly prioritized during the development. The easy observable part of Human Factors (i.e. physical ergonomics) is often in focus. Poor focus on Human Factors in the design process creates demanding conditions for human operators and impact safety and resilience. There is lack of non-technical skills such as communication and decision-making. New technical equipment such as Closed Circuit Television is implemented without appropriate use of Human Factors standards. Human Factors expertise should be involved as early as possible in the responsible organizations. Verification and validation of Human Factors should be improved and performed from the start, by certified Human Factors experts in collaboration with the workforce. The authorities should check-back that the regulatory framework of Human Factors is communicated, understood and followed. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.",accident analysis; design for reliability; Human Factors; human reliability; safety analysis; Safety engineering,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part O: Journal of Risk and Reliability",2017,Journal,Johnsen S.O.; Kilskar S.S.; Fossum K.R.,10.1177/1748006X17698066
Performance awarenessPredicting cognitive performance during simulated shiftwork using chronobiological measures,Physiological tracers of circadian rhythms and a performance awareness index were examined as predictors of cognitive performance during two sleep deprivation conditions common to occupational shiftwork. Study 1Thirty-three sleep-deprived participants completed a simulated nightshift. Study 2Thirty-two partially sleep-deprived participants completed a simulated dayshift. A standardized logic test was used to measure cognitive performance. Body temperature and heart rate were measured as chronobiological indices of endogenous circadian rhythms. Performance awareness was calculated as a correlation between actual and perceived performance. These studies demonstrated a parallelism between performance awareness and the circadian rhythm. Chronobiological changes were predictive of performance awareness during the simulated nightshift but not dayshift. Only oral temperature was a significant independent predictor. Oral temperature predicted an individual's awareness of their own performance better than their own subjective awareness. These findings suggest that using circadian rhythms in applied ergonomics may reduce occupational risk due to low performance awareness. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd,Body temperature; Circadian rhythm; Occupational health,Applied Ergonomics,2017,Journal,Morris D.M.; Pilcher J.J.; Mulvihill J.B.; Vander Wood M.A.,10.1016/j.apergo.2017.03.009
On the use of Virtual Reality for a human-centered workplace design,"In the Industry 4.0 and digital revolution era, the world of manufacturing industry is experiencing an innovative reconfiguration of design tools and methodologies, with a different approach to the production processes organization. The design philosophy is changing, integrating to engineering contribution interpretative aspects (design thinking), executive practices (design doing) and cognitive aspects (design cultures). The design becomes human-centered. The new Virtual Reality technologies allow to validate performances of designed products and production processes by means of virtual prototypes in a virtual simulated environment. This approach generates several benefits to the companies, in terms of costs and time, and allows optimizing the assembly line design and related workplaces, by improving workers' benefits too. This paper proposes an innovative method to validate the design of workplaces on automotive assembly lines in a virtual environment, based on ergonomic approach, according to ERGO - Uas system, applied by FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) groups, that integrates UAS method for measurement and EAWS method for biomechanical effort evaluation. Creating 3D virtual scenarios allows to carry on assembly tasks by virtual manikins in order to be evaluated from different points of view. In particular, data coming from the simulation can be used to assess several ergonomic indexes, improving safety, quality and design. The analysis is supported by the use of a motion capture system, developed by the University of Campania and composed of wearable inertial sensors, that estimates the attitude of fundamental human segments, using sensor fusion algorithms based on Kalman filtering. In this way, it is possible to make a further design validation, assessing the EAWS index basing on posture angles trends evaluated. This method can represent an innovation for human-centered design of workplace in developing new products, reducing costs and improving job quality. © 2018 Procedia Structural Integrity.

A multi-discipline method to assess the human performance in manufacturing industry for safety and quality optimization,"Nowadays the majority of organizations operating in manufacturing field recognize the importance of including the Human Factor contribution in the industrial process optimization (Hong et al. 2007). Technical measures and work organization procedures have been optimized in order to reduce the defects and waste generation but the Human Performance prediction still represents for Managers a difficult task to deal with.The prediction of the human performances of all workers involved in a production system would help Managers in better allocating the human resources. In order to reach this objective, a model to quantify the human capability of managing a complex task in a working context characterized by a set of physical, organizational and cognitive factors was designed.This paper presents the preliminary results of a three years industry/academia partnership project to assess the human performance in manufacturing plant. A multi-discipline approach involving both technical and individual factors was adopted. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Safety and Reliability - Safe Societies in a Changing World - Proceedings of the 28th International European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2018",2018,Conference,Comberti L.; Demichela M.; Leva M.C.,10.1201/9781351174664-48
The neuroergonomics of aircraft cockpits: The four stages of eye-tracking integration to enhance flight safety,"Commercial aviation is currently one of the safest modes of transportation; however, human error is still one major contributing cause of aeronautical accidents and incidents. One promising avenue to further enhance flight safety is Neuroergonomics, an approach at the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive engineering and human factors, which aims to create better human–system interaction. Eye-tracking technology allows users to “monitor the monitoring” by providing insights into both pilots’ attentional distribution and underlying decisional processes. In this position paper, we identify and define a framework of four stages of step-by-step integration of eye-tracking systems in modern cockpits. Stage I concerns Pilot Training and Flight Performance Analysis on-ground; stage II proposes On-board Gaze Recordings as extra data for the “black box” recorders; stage III describes Gaze-Based Flight Deck Adaptation including warning and alerting systems, and, eventually, stage IV prophesies Gaze-Based Aircraft Adaptation including authority taking by the aircraft. We illustrate the potential of these four steps with a description of incidents or accidents that we could certainly have avoided thanks to eye-tracking. Estimated milestones for the integration of each stage are also proposed together with a list of some implementation limitations. We believe that the research institutions and industrial actors of the domain will all benefit from the integration of the framework of the eye-tracking systems into cockpits. © 2018 by the authors.",Aircraft cockpit; Assistive technologies; Eye movements; Eye-tracking; Human factors; Neuroergonomics,Safety,2018,Journal,Peysakhovich V.; Lefrançois O.; Dehais F.; Causse M.,10.3390/safety4010008
Proposal for evaluatingworkers’work characteristics – Case study on business machinery production line,"The General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) is widely used to evaluate a subject’s cognitive ability for the purpose of selecting appropriate employment. The results of the GATB have been used to place staff in departments ranging from clerical departments to assembly lines. However, at actual manufacturing and assembly sites, workers receive mixed evaluations of “slow work” and “fast work” from the site administrators even though they all have high GATB scores for their jobs. In this study, with the aim of improving job design and employment selection, we do a detailed analysis of the existing GATB method of evaluating work characteristics and worker capacities. We conduct inspection ratings to measure each worker’s ability to adjust their working speeds and analyze the relationship between the GATB score and the worker evaluations. Next, we discover specific motions that explain the evaluation of workers by analyzing worker motions during the GATB. Lastly, we propose a method of determining whether an employee can work quickly in the field. © 2017, Fuji Technology Press.

Psychophysiological assessment of an adaptive asynchronous human–machine system with the dual-task method,"Human error is one of the leading causes of industrial accidents at modern manufacturing production sites. An adaptive asynchronous human–machine system (Async-HMS) was previously proposed as a new mechanism for preventing the reduction of cognitive level by controlling the actual operation period of machines that lead to monotonous behavior. The objective of this paper is to assess Async-HMS from the aspects of person’s current capacity for performing processing resources. A dual-task method consisting of a synchronization task with three periodic fluctuations and four levels of difficulties of mental arithmetic tasks was conducted with Async-HMS on a PC. The three periodic fluctuations are constant periodic fluctuation (Cnst), perceptible periodic fluctuation (Supraliminal), and imperceptible periodic fluctuation (Subliminal). The task performance and the psychophysiological state were assessed through the dual-task method. In an ANOVA analysis, the time shared fraction, which is an index of processing resources devoted to an arithmetic task, had no significant effect on the synchronization task. The mean blood pressure in Subliminal had a significant increase compared with that in Cnst and Supraliminal. These results indicate that subliminal fluctuation evokes sympathetic hyperactivity without affecting processing resources. Implementation of subliminal operation period into industrial machines performing periodic behavior might inhibit monotony and, therefore, prevent human error. © 2017, ISAROB.",Dual-task method; Hemodynamic parameters; Human error; Human–machine system; Processing resources,Artificial Life and Robotics,2017,Journal,Bando S.; Oiwa K.; Nozawa A.,10.1007/s10015-017-0353-6
Towards modern inclusive factories: A methodology for the development of smart adaptive human-machine interfaces,"Modern manufacturing systems typically require high degrees of flexibility, in terms of ability to customize the production lines to the constantly changing market requests. For this purpose, manufacturing systems are required to be able to cope with changes in the types of products, and in the size of the production batches. As a consequence, the human-machine interfaces (HMIs) are typically very complex, and include a wide range of possible operational modes and commands. This generally implies an unsustainable cognitive workload for the human operators, in addition to a non-negligible training effort. To overcome this issue, in this paper we present a methodology for the design of adaptive human-centred HMIs for industrial machines and robots. The proposed approach relies on three pillars: measurement of user's capabilities, adaptation of the information presented in the HMI, and training of the user. The results expected from the application of the proposed methodology are investigated in terms of increased customization and productivity of manufacturing processes, and wider acceptance of automation technologies. The proposed approach has been devised in the framework of the European project INCLUSIVE. © 2017 IEEE.",,"IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA",2017,Conference,Villani V.; Sabattini L.; Czerniak J.N.; Mertens A.; Vogel-Heuser B.; Fantuzzi C.,10.1109/ETFA.2017.8247634
Decision centric knowledge management system for manufacturing SMEs: A conceptual framework,"Knowledge workers and their productivity has become the most crucial component for productivity and sustainability of SMEs all over the world. Decision-making is an integral part of the business process and one of the main responsibilities of knowledge workers. This study, therefore, focuses on developing a conceptual model to identify and evaluate the contribution of knowledge workers to the decision-making process and the mediating function of the knowledge management system. The proposed conceptual model illustrates the effect of cognitive skills, technical skills, and social skills of the knowledge workers on the knowledge management system (including information technology, human resource, and sharing behavior) and the decision-making process of manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia.

Architectural framework in next learning support environment,"Information technology has given successive and successful evolutions to different types of methods, means, tools, systems, environments and so on in learning/teaching activities, as well as the effectiveness of various kinds of human activities such as industrial productions, social systems, economical managements, etc. This trend must be always evaluated positively when today is called as the information society, knowledge society or intelligent environment. On the contrary, it is true that the evolutional change has generated newly other problems in IT-based learning support strategy. In this paper, we address an architectural framework in the next learning support environment from a viewpoint of knowledge management. Our idea is to organize the paradigm, based on the newly-conceptualized learning action cycle of acquisition, understanding, utilization and thinking, but not derived from the traditional research view of acquisition and understanding. In order to attain this idea we adapt our knowledge handling model, proposed by ourselves, with a view to making up its platform and designing the functionality and mechanism. Also, we discuss the feature of our framework under the cognitive load and the goal achievement, which give important viewpoints to the learning activity that we always focus on when we address and develop the support functions/mechanism. © 2017 ACM.",Acquisition; Cognitive load; Goal achievement; Knowledge management; Learning support; Thinking; Understanding; Utilization,"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication, IMCOM 2017",2017,Conference,Watanabe T.,10.1145/3022227.3025023
Joint Resource Management in Cognitive Radio and Edge Computing Based Industrial Wireless Networks,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution we are experiencing currently is reshaping the world by facilitating factories with intelligence and significantly improved manufacturing efficiency and flexibility. Among the key technologies to achieve Industrie 4.0, industrial wireless networking enables convenient and reliable connections among the machines, network devices, cloud servers and humans for both delay-sensitive traffic and delay-tolerant data delivery. In this paper, the Cognitive radio and Edge computing based Industrial wireless Network (CEIN) is introduced. In CEIN, edge computing handles the processing requirements of the data during its transmission, and is deployed close to the machines for immediate response to delay-sensitive industrial data that requires real-time processing. Cognitive radio technologies are also adopted to ensure efficient spectrum resource utilization for big delay-tolerant data transmission that contributes mostly to the industrial data traffic. Besides, we propose an optimal networking and computing resource management scheme for CEIN. The harvested spectrum bands are allocated to the network devices taking into account of the computing requirements of industrial data. Stochastic optimization is adopted to find the optimal allocation actions with low on-line computational complexity. Extensive simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the significant system performance improvement. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Proceedings - IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM",2017,Conference,Si P.; Liang H.; Wu W.; Zhang Y.,10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254745
Improving worker productivity in advanced manufacturing environments,"As information technology becomes more pervasive, the role of workers in manufacturing and commercial enterprises is changing rapidly from direct interaction with products and customers to supervisory control of increasingly complex systems. However, lean manufacturing has tended to focus mainly on physical production processes and is less effective when dealing with information flows and cognitive work. This paper describes research into work analysis methods that form the basis for effective productivity improvement guides for knowledge workers. Through an action research approach, it focuses on complex problem solving in a highly automated manufacturing environment. We present four productivity improvement principles accompanied by practical methods that improve the visibility and analysis of cognitive work, communication patterns and information flows. © 2017 IEEE.",cognitive work; knowledge work; Lean manufacturing; productivity; six sigma,"2017 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation: Engineering, Technology and Innovation Management Beyond 2020: New Challenges, New Approaches, ICE/ITMC 2017 - Proceedings",2017,Conference,Gleeson F.; Goodman L.; Hargaden V.; Coughlan P.,10.1109/ICE.2017.8279902

User interface prototype through participatory cognitive task analysis,"Transition of technology has led to the transformation from human physical strength to the cognitive thinking capability. In fact drastic changes in the technology have changed the research analysis from technical orientation to cognitive analysis. To date, the goal of this study is to design a User Interface (UI) which provides information for the user, to interpret and act upon effectively. In this study, close participation from the experts in the field of manufacturing industries are essential as their real time experiences in handling the system maintenance will be used as an input in developing UI prototype. Three instrumentation engineers from the manufacturing industries involved in this study, as to gather issues and problems in system maintenance by using Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) method. In addition, system maintenance failure archived data were also analysed, to investigate the real time system maintenance problems. In order to help system users to be prepared on any possible obstacles during system maintenance, the input from the real time system maintenance problems were used to map up with the development of UI prototype. From the participatory CTA analysis, three common tasks that need to be considered in the UI prototype were cable, sensor and driver failures. Failure signal alarms were displayed on the UI prototype and solutions to overcome the system failure were also included in the UI prototype design. It is hope that by incorporating the real scenarios of the cognitive tasks in the development of the UI prototype will help users to enhance their tasks, and at the same time to increase the ease of use of the UI system at workplace. © 2016 IEEE.",cognitive task analysis; participatory approach; user interface design,"Proceedings - 2016 4th International Conference on User Science and Engineering, i-USEr 2016",2017,Conference,Rosli D.I.; Alias R.A.; Rahman A.A.,10.1109/IUSER.2016.7857943
"Movers, Shakers, and Those Who Stand Still: Visual Attention-grabbing Techniques in Robot Teleoperation","We designed and evaluated a series of teleoperation interface techniques that aim to draw operator attention while mitigating negative effects of interruption. Monitoring live teleoperation video feeds, for example to search for survivors in search and rescue, can be cognitively taxing, particularly for operators driving multiple robots or monitoring multiple cameras. To reduce workload, emerging computer vision techniques can automatically identify and indicate (cue) salient points of potential interest for the operator. However, it is not clear how to cue such points to a preoccupied operator - whether cues would be distracting and a hindrance to operators - and how the design of the cue may impact operator cognitive load, attention drawn, and primary task performance. In this paper, we detail our iterative design process for creating a range of visual attention-grabbing cues that are grounded in psychological literature on human attention, and two formal evaluations that measure attention-grabbing capability and impact on operator performance. Our results show that visually cueing on-screen points of interest does not distract operators, that operators perform poorly without the cues, and detail how particular cue design parameters impact operator cognitive load and task performance. Specifically, full-screen cues can lower cognitive load, but can increase response time; animated cues may improve accuracy, but increase cognitive load. Finally, from this design process we provide tested, and theoretically grounded cues for attention drawing in teleoperation. © 2017 ACM.",attention; human-robot interaction; multi-robot teleoperation,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,2017,Conference,Rea D.J.; Seo S.H.; Bruce N.; Young J.E.,10.1145/2909824.3020246
Design of an industrial human-robot system through participative simulations - Tank cleaning case study,"Industrials are starting to deploy interactive robots as new solutions to improve workstations. In particular, workstations where human operators may get injured because of repetitive tasks, bad postures or heavy loads are targeted. The introduction of such interactive systems on industrial workstations brings new challenges concerning human cognitive and physical considerations to factories. We followed an approach involving operators, and ergonomics and cognitive engineering skills to improve the introduction of interactive robots in the industry. In this paper, we present the first application of our work on a pyrotechnic tank cleaning workstation. Our approach is illustrated with the design of a solution through several simulation steps involving the workstation's operators.

Cognitive work analysis: An influential legacy extending beyond human factors and engineering,"Jens Rasmussen's multifaceted legacy includes cognitive work analysis (CWA), a framework for the analysis, design, and evaluation of complex sociotechnical systems. After considering the framework's origins, this paper reviews its progress, predictably covering experimental research on ecological interface design, case studies of the application of CWA to human factors and engineering problems in industry, and methods and modelling tools for CWA. Emphasis is placed, however, on studying the nexus between some of the recent results obtained with CWA and the original field studies of human problem-solving that motivated the framework's development. Of particular interest is a case study of the use of CWA for military doctrine development, a problem commonly regarded as lying outside the fields of human factors and engineering. It is concluded that the value of CWA, even for such diverse problems, is likely to result from its conceptual grounding in empirical observations of patterns of human reasoning in complex systems. © 2016",Cognitive work analysis; Jens Rasmussen; Problem-solving; Reasoning; Sociotechnical systems,Applied Ergonomics,2017,Journal,Naikar N.,10.1016/j.apergo.2016.06.001
"Causes, consequences and countermeasures to driver fatigue in the rail industry: The train driver perspective","Fatigue is an important workplace risk management issue. Within the rail industry, the passing of a stop signal (signal passed at danger; SPAD) is considered to be one of the most major safety breaches which can occur. Train drivers are very aware of the negative consequences associated with a SPAD. Therefore, SPADs provide a practical and applied safety relevant context within which to structure a discussion on fatigue. Focus groups discussing contributing factors to SPADs were undertaken at eight passenger rail organisations across Australia and New Zealand (n = 28 drivers). Data relating to fatigue was extracted and inductively analysed identifying three themes: causes, consequences, and countermeasures (to fatigue). Drivers experienced negative consequences of fatigue, despite existing countermeasures to mitigate it. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue management. A fatigue assessment tool consistently informed rostering, however, shift swapping was commonplace and often unregulated, reducing any potential positive impact. In discussing fatigue countermeasure strategies, drivers talked interchangeably about mitigating task related fatigue (e.g. increasing cognitive load) and sleepiness (e.g. caffeine). Ensuring the concepts of fatigue and sleepiness are properly understood has the potential to maximise safety. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Fatigue; Rail safety; Sleep; Train driving,Applied Ergonomics,2017,Journal,Filtness A.J.; Naweed A.,10.1016/j.apergo.2016.10.009
CLAM - A method for cognitive load assessment in manufacturing,"The increasing complexity and demands of assembly operations in manufacturing has been shown to lead to increased cognitive load in assembly workers. Previous work has outlined the complexity of an assembly worker's situation both in terms of difficulty and speed of work and there have been a few attempts at creating frameworks and methods for understanding the key aspects of what creates increased cognitive load. This paper presents a tool for assessing cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly. The paper presents the method and an accompanying tool as well as some insights derived from this method development. The intended contribution of the work is to make a difference in reducing the cognitive load of assembly workers on the shop floor, thus focusing the development on applicability and usability of the tool in practice. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

Manufacturing in the wild–viewing human-based assembly through the lens of distributed cognition,"The interdisciplinary field of cognitive science has been and is becoming increasingly central within human factors and ergonomics (HF&E) and, since at the same time, there has long been a call for a more systems perspective in the area with a somewhat wider unit of analysis. This paper argues that the theoretical framework of distributed cognition would greatly benefit the application of HF&E to manufacturing and would offer a more holistic understanding of the interactions between different entities within a greater context, including the social, cultural and materialistic. We aim to characterize and analyse manufacturing as a complex socio-technical system from a distributed cognition perspective; focusing on the use, mediation and integration of different forms of representations, tools and artefacts in this domain. We present illustrative examples from authentic manual assembly, showing the cognitively distributed nature of the work, ranging from scaffolding strategies of the individual worker to the emergent properties of a whole assembly line. The paper further proposes and provides benefits of using a distributed cognition framework as a novel approach in the toolbox for the HF&E discipline, where it may have been found before, but the application to manufacturing has been absent. © 2017 The Author(s).

The Benefits of Human-centred Design in Industrial Practices: Re-design of Workstations in Pipe Industry,"Sustainable Manufacturing (SM) traditionally focused on optimization of environmental and economic aspects, by neglecting the human performance. However, the industrial plant's costs, productivity and process quality highly depend on the individual human performance (e.g., comfort perceived, physical and mental workload, simplicity of actions, personal satisfaction) and how much hazardous positions and uncomfortable tasks finally cost to the company. The present paper defines a human-centred virtual simulation environment to optimize physical ergonomics in workstation design and demonstrates its benefits on an industrial case study in pipe industry. The proposed environment aims at overcoming traditional approaches, where analysis are carried out at the shop-floor when the plant is already created, by providing a virtual environment to easily test and verify different design solutions to optimize physical, cognitive and organizational ergonomics. © 2017 The Authors",Digital Human Models (DHM); Human-Centred Design (HCD); Manufacturing Ergonomics; Virtual Reality; Workstation design,Procedia Manufacturing,2017,Conference,Peruzzini M.; Carassai S.; Pellicciari M.,10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.251
Revisiting the technologies of the old: a case study of cognitive work analysis and nanomaterials,"Nanotechnology is bringing about changes in everyday technologies in fundamental ways, both obvious and non-obvious. In order to address nanotechnology, Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) as a research discipline requires multiple methods in engaging this novel technology strategically. One mode of engagement is through nanomaterials. Nanomaterials can be addressed by HFE in four significant ways: health and safety; new products and embedding in existing technologies for improved qualities; industrial production; along with, through university laboratory research. The aim of this article is to present one manner of engaging nanomaterials and HFE through addressing nanomaterials as embedded in existing technologies and their involvement in university research laboratories. This aspect of engagement is depicted by addressing the use of nanomaterials in an existing well-entrenched technology of concrete to produce an enhanced product—nanoconcrete. Using the framework of Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), this article addresses the work domain of nanoconcrete in terms of work practices in university laboratory settings. The models derived from CWA are used to identify the various constraints ranging from the environment to the people involved in the concrete domain. The results emphasize that to address nanomaterials (in this case, nanosilica), one has to comprehend its overarching matrix of the material (concrete) in which it is embedded. While the current article presents just one facet studying the intersection between nanomaterials and HFE, further research can identify new ways in which nanotechnology could be integrated robustly in the disciplinary viewpoint of HFE. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA); Ergonomics; Human factors; Nanomaterials; Nanotechnology,"Cognition, Technology and Work",2017,Journal,Kant V.,10.1007/s10111-016-0397-8

Real world verbal protocol data analysis of European Rail Traffic Management System train driving and conventional train driving,"The European Train Control System (ETCS) as part of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) is a train automation and control system, which has been introduced into the UK rail network, triggering a need to understand its impact on the train driving task and train driver behaviour. In particular, an industry requirement for Human Factors (HF) research and the necessity to understand the effect ERTMS has on drivers' cognitive strategies and demands. A real world exploratory eye-Tracking study was conducted with both conventional and ERTMS drivers on their normal timetabled routes. In addition to the eye movement measures, a mixture of concurrent and retrospective verbal protocol data was collected and analysed using thematic analysis. The verbal dataset provides explanations for any differences in visual behaviour between ERTMS drivers and conventional drivers.

Adapting level of detail in user interfaces for Cybersecurity operations,"As cybersecurity threats increasingly appear in news headlines, the security industry continues to build state of the art firewall and intrusion detection systems for monitoring activities in complex cyber networks. These systems generate millions of log files and continuous alerts. In order to make sense of cyber data, cyber security and system administrators review and analyze millions of logs using highly summarized views and manual cycles of click-intensive details-on-demand. This is laborious, induces cognitive overload, and is prone to errors resulting in important information and impacts not being seen when most needed. Our research focus is on developing 'FocalPoint' a system that provides Adaptive Level of Detail (LOD) in user interfaces for cybersecurity operations. FocalPoint is a recommender system tailored for complex network information structures that reasons about contextual information associated with the network, user tasks, and cognitive load. This facilitates tuning cyber visualization displays thereby improving user performance in perception, comprehension and projection of current Cybersecurity Situational Awareness (Cyber SA). For cyber analysts, having the right information, in context, when most needed without cognitive overload could lead to effective decision making in cyber operations. We provide a use case scenario for FocalPoint with an in-progress prototype and highlight various challenges and potential considerations for building an effective adaptive system. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive User Interfaces; Adaptive Visualization; Context-aware Reasoning; Cybersecurity; Human Computer Interaction; Network Situation Awareness,"Proceedings - 2016 Resilience Week, RWS 2016",2016,Conference,Inibhunu C.; Langevin S.; Ralph S.; Kronefeld N.; Soh H.; Jamieson G.A.; Sanner S.; Kortschot S.W.; Carrasco C.; White M.,10.1109/RWEEK.2016.7573300
WAP: Cognitive aspects in unit testing: The hunting game and the hunter's perspective,"Humans are hunters and love the chase - they hunt for food, they hunt for bugs in software. In the last decade, testing research has gone deeper and broader to help with the challenging task of catching bugs. Much of the literature approaches the problem from a theoretical-technical perspective and is often oriented to automated solutions. Yet, there is a gap between industry testing problems and research testing solutions. We take a different perspective and consider the human component as a major part of the solution for practical testing problems. Many of these human-related issues are reported in academic surveys of practitioners. We highlight the importance of human factors in testing by introducing a hunting metaphor. We also bring attention to evidence on cognitive support demands in unit test practices. An initial framework is proposed as an effort to bring understanding of cognitive support demands, and provides direction for further research on unit testing tools which support tester skill improvement. © 2015 IEEE.",,"2015 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, ISSRE 2015",2016,Conference,Prado M.P.; Verbeek E.; Storey M.-A.; Vincenzi A.M.R.,10.1109/ISSRE.2015.7381832

The Effects of Varying Break Length on Attention and Time on Task,"Objective: We aimed to discover how varying the length of task breaks would affect the time-on-task effect in subsequent testing periods. Background: An important means of preventing errors and accidents caused by mental fatigue and time on task is to intersperse rest intervals within long work periods. Most studies of rest pauses to date have examined their effects in real-world tasks and settings, and their subtler effects on behavior, as measurable by laboratory paradigms, are not well understood. Method: We studied a group of 71 participants as they completed a 1-hr auditory oddball task with two rest opportunities. Rest intervals were 1, 5, or 10 min long. Results: Improvements in reaction time were significantly positively associated with length of the rest break. However, longer breaks were also associated with steeper decrements in performance in the subsequent task block. Across individuals, the amount of immediate improvement correlated with the extent of later decline. Conclusion: Our results support a resource/effort-allocation model of fatigue, whereby longer breaks bias participants toward greater effort expenditure on resumption of the task when cognitive resources may not have been fully replenished. Application: These findings may have implications for the refinement of work-rest schedules in industries where time-on-task degradation in performance is an important concern. © 2015 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",effort allocation; mental fatigue; resource theory; rest break; sustained attention,Human Factors,2016,Journal,Lim J.; Kwok K.,10.1177/0018720815617395
High-precision telerobot with human-centered variable perspective and scalable gestural interface,"Telerobotics (i.e., remote-controlling robots) is highly attractive for tasks in potentially dangerous situations, e.g., search and rescue, space exploration, and handling hazardous materials. However, when telerobots are deployed to complete tasks, the human operator needs to develop task plan and figure out how to execute it using the available control interface. Inappropriate controls can lead to excessive cognitive load and long task completion times. If the human operator can interact with the robot in an intuitive way, he or she can focus more on the task. For that reason, we have designed a human-centered control interface that allows the operator to modify the user perspective, command via hand gestures and natural language, and scale human input motion to any suitable range on the robot. The interface consists of a Leap Motion Controller for hand tracking, microphone for speech detection, and a simple turn knob for varying the scaling factor between the human and robot motions. The teleoperator software utilizes the Robot Operating System (ROS) which enables open-source development and hardware agnosticism. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system by executing a high-precision task of threading a needle. Furthermore, we present results from a usability study in where people were asked to complete high-precision tasks with both the developed human-centered gestural control input and a conventional functionality-centered drag-and-drop interface. © 2016 IEEE.",high-precision; human-robot interface; industrial robot; ROS; scalable; spatial mapping; supervisory control; teleoperator,"Proceedings - 2016 9th International Conference on Human System Interactions, HSI 2016",2016,Conference,Kruusamae K.; Pryor M.,10.1109/HSI.2016.7529630
Trust-based compliant robot-human handovers of payloads in collaborative assembly in flexible manufacturing,"A human-robot hybrid cell is developed for performing assembly in flexible manufacturing in collaboration between a robot and its human co-worker. Robot trust in human is considered, a computational model for the trust is derived, and a method to measure and display the trust in real-time is developed. The collaborative assembly includes robot-to-human handovers of payloads (assembly tools). A novel trust-based compliant handover motion planning strategy for the robot is derived. The robot varies its handover configuration and motion based on robot trust in human through kinematic redundancy with the aim of reducing potential impulse forces on human body through payload during handover. A comprehensive scheme is developed to evaluate the collaborative assembly including the trust-based handover strategy. The evaluation results show that consideration of robot trust in human during the assembly and adjustment in handover configuration and motion based on robot's trust levels in human significantly improve human-robot interaction and assembly performance through increasing safety, human trust in robot, handover success rate, and the overall assembly efficiency by 20%, 37.58%, 30% and 6.73% respectively and reducing cognitive workload by 25.63%, with a minor reduction in the handover efficiency by 1.87%. © 2016 IEEE.",,IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering,2016,Conference,Rahman S.M.M.; Wang Y.; Walker I.D.; Mears L.; Pak R.; Remy S.,10.1109/COASE.2016.7743428
Towards Low Cost Prototyping of Mobile Opportunistic Disconnection Tolerant Networks and Systems,"Fast emerging mobile edge computing, mobile clouds, Internet of Things, and cyber physical systems require many novel realistic real-time multi-layer algorithms for a wide range of domains, such as intelligent content provision and processing, smart transport, smart manufacturing systems, and mobile end-user applications. This paper proposes a low-cost open source platform, MODiToNeS, which uses commodity hardware to support prototyping and testing of fully distributed multi-layer complex algorithms over real-world (or pseudoreal) traces. MODiToNeS platform is generic and comprises multiple interfaces that allow real-time topology and mobility control, deployment and analysis of different self-organized and self-adaptive routing algorithms, real-time content processing, and real-time environment sensing with predictive analytics. Our platform also allows rich interactivity with the user. We show deployment and analysis of two vastly different complex networking systems: A fault and disconnection-aware smart manufacturing sensor network and cognitive privacy for personal clouds. We show that our platform design can integrate both contexts transparently and organically and allows a wide range of analysis. © 2013 IEEE.",Disruption tolerant networking; mobile ad hoc networks; prototypes; wireless communication; wireless sensor networks,IEEE Access,2016,Journal,Radenkovic M.; Crowcroft J.; Rehmani M.H.,10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2606501
A vertical and cyber-physical integration of cognitive robots in manufacturing,"Cognitive robots, able to adapt their actions based on sensory information and the management of uncertainty, have begun to find their way into manufacturing settings. However, the full potential of these robots has not been fully exploited, largely due to the lack of vertical integration with existing IT infrastructures, such as the manufacturing execution system (MES), as part of a large-scale cyber-physical entity. This paper reports on considerations and findings from the research project STAMINA that is developing such a cognitive cyber-physical system and applying it to a concrete and well-known use case from the automotive industry. Our approach allows manufacturing tasks to be performed without human intervention, even if the available description of the environment - the world model - suffers from large uncertainties. Thus, the robot becomes an integral part of the MES, resulting in a highly flexible overall system. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Autonomous systems; cognitive robotics; manufacturing execution system (MES); planning; robot skills; world model,Proceedings of the IEEE,2016,Journal,Krueger V.; Chazoule A.; Crosby M.; Lasnier A.; Pedersen M.R.; Rovida F.; Nalpantidis L.; Petrick R.; Toscano C.; Veiga G.,10.1109/JPROC.2016.2521731
Ergonomics and beyond,"Objective: To honor Tom Waters's work on emerging occupational health issues, we review the literature on physical along with chemical exposures and their impact on functional outcomes. Background: Many occupations present the opportunity for exposure to multiple hazardous exposures, including both physical and chemical factors. However, little is known about how these different factors affect functional ability and injury. The goal of this review is to examine the relationships between these exposures, impairment of the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems, functional outcomes, and health problems with a focus on acute injury. Method: Literature was identified using online databases, including PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Google Scholar. References from included articles were searched for additional relevant articles. Results: This review documented the limited existing literature that discussed cognitive impairment and functional disorders via neurotoxicity for physical exposures (heat and repetitive loading) and chemical exposures (pesticides, volatile organic compounds [VOCs], and heavy metals). Conclusion: This review supports that workers are exposed to physical and chemical exposures that are associated with negative health effects, including functional impairment and injury. Innovation in exposure assessment with respect to quantifying the joint exposure to these different exposures is especially needed for developing risk assessment models and, ultimately, preventive measures. Application: Along with physical exposures, chemical exposures need to be considered, alone and in combination, in assessing functional ability and occupationally related injuries. © 2016 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",metals; occupational; pesticides; postural sway; VOCs,Human Factors,2016,Journal,Ross J.A.; Shipp E.M.; Trueblood A.B.; Bhattacharya A.,10.1177/0018720816645457
Verification of the effect of an assembly skill transfer method on cognition skills,"This paper aims to investigate an effective assembly skill transfer method to improve the novice operator's assembly performance. Training novice operators with all of the skilled operators' assembly skills in a short time has so far proven unsuccessful. Therefore, to accelerate the training period, we attempted to extract and transfer the assembly skills on which the skilled operators and the novice operators place different emphases. Since the assembly tasks in the cellular manufacturing system primarily comprise cognitive tasks, the assembly performance depends on the operators' cognition skills. We applied the developed skill transfer method via a “peg-insertion task” to verify its effect on cognition skills. The results indicate that the proposed assembly skill transfer system can considerably improve novice operators' assembly performance. © 2015 IEEE.",Assembly skill; Cellular manufacturing; Cognition skill; Skill transfer,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,2016,Journal,Duan F.; Zhang Z.; Gao Q.; Arai T.,10.1109/TCDS.2016.2535289
Time Sharing between Robotics and Process Control: Validating a Model of Attention Switching,"Objective: The aim of this study was to validate the strategic task overload management (STOM) model that predicts task switching when concurrence is impossible. Background: The STOM model predicts that in overload, tasks will be switched to, to the extent that they are attractive on task attributes of high priority, interest, and salience and low difficulty. But more-difficult tasks are less likely to be switched away from once they are being performed. Method: In Experiment 1, participants performed four tasks of the Multi-Attribute Task Battery and provided task-switching data to inform the role of difficulty and priority. In Experiment 2, participants concurrently performed an environmental control task and a robotic arm simulation. Workload was varied by automation of arm movement and both the phases of environmental control and existence of decision support for fault management. Attention to the two tasks was measured using a head tracker. Results: Experiment 1 revealed the lack of influence of task priority and confirmed the differing roles of task difficulty. In Experiment 2, the percentage attention allocation across the eight conditions was predicted by the STOM model when participants rated the four attributes. Model predictions were compared against empirical data and accounted for over 95% of variance in task allocation. More-difficult tasks were performed longer than easier tasks. Task priority does not influence allocation. Conclusions: The multiattribute decision model provided a good fit to the data. Applications: The STOM model is useful for predicting cognitive tunneling given that human-in-the-loop simulation is time-consuming and expensive.

Distributed cognition in manufacturing: Collaborative assembly work,"Cognitive science is becoming increasingly central within human factors and ergonomics (HF&E) and there has long been a call for a more systemic perspective in the area with a somewhat broader unit of analysis. This paper presents a case study applying the theoretical framework of distributed cognition (DCog), which shows how DCog would offer a more complete understanding of manufacturing within its greater context, including the social, cultural, and material surroundings. This paper aims to characterize and analyse dock assembly of forest machines as a complex socio-technical system from a DCog perspective; focusing on the creation of enacted landscapes in this particular setting. The paper also exemplifies benefits of using the DCog framework in the manufacturing domain as a way of grasping the assembly workers' tacit competence and skills. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

Weaving machine as cyber-physical production system: Multi-objective self-optimization of the weaving process,"Real (physical) objects melt together with information-processing (virtual) objects. These blends are called Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). The German government identifies this technological revolution as the fourth step of industrialization (Industry 4.0). Through embedding of intelligent, self-optimizing CPPS in process chains, productivity of manufacturing companies and quality of goods can be increased. Textile producers especially in high-wage countries have to cope with the trend towards smaller lot sizes in combination with the demand for increasing product variations. One possibility to cope with these changing market trends consists in manufacturing with CPPS and cognitive machinery. This paper focuses on woven fabric production and presents a method for multi-objective self-optimization of the weaving process. Multi-objective self-optimization assists the operator in setting weaving machine parameters according to the objective functions warp tension, energy consumption and fabric quality. Individual preferences of customers and plant management are integrated into the optimization routine. The implementation of desirability functions together with Nelder/Mead algorithm in a software-based Programmable Logic Controller (soft-PLC) is presented. The self-optimization routine enables a weaving machine to calculate the optimal parameter settings autonomously. Set-up time is reduced by 75 % and objective functions are improved by at least 14 % compared to manual machine settings. © 2016 IEEE.",cognition; Industry 4.0; optimization; setup time; weaving,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology,2016,Conference,Saggiomo M.; Kemper M.; Gloy Y.-S.; Gries T.,10.1109/ICIT.2016.7475090
A study of privacy and security concerns on doctors' and nurses' behavioral intentions to use RFID in hospitals,"Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a useful technology that has myriad applications in retail, manufacturing, and healthcare settings. RFID can scan devices in their proximity and report the data to information systems. RFID in healthcare settings presents potential security and privacy concerns to the people and processes being tracked by the devices - particularly healthcare workers including nurses and doctors. This research presents a theoretical model that will assess the effect of six independent variables: cognitive factors, perception of external control, privacy concerns regarding surveillance and RFID devices, subjective norms, existence of security policy, and persistence of data on three dependent variables, medical staff perceived usefulness of RFID, intention to use RFID, and actual use of RFID. The model is validated with an empirical study. The results suggest that cognitive factors, persistence of data captured through RFID, and the awareness of the existence of security policy influence medical staff members' use of RFID in hospitals. © 2016 IEEE.",Empirical; Health Information Technology; Privacy; RFID; Security,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2016,Conference,Winston T.G.; Paul S.; Iyer L.,10.1109/HICSS.2016.392
"Comparing tactile, auditory, and visual assembly error-feedback for workers with cognitive impairments","More and more industrial manufacturing companies are outsourcing assembly tasks to sheltered work organizations where cognitively impaired workers are employed. To facilitate these assembly tasks assistive systems have been introduced to provide cognitive assistance. While previous work found that these assistive systems have a great impact on the workers' performance in giving assembly instructions, these systems are further capable of detecting errors and notifying the worker of an assembly error. However, the topic of how assembly errors are presented to cognitively impaired workers has not been analyzed scientifically. In this paper, we close this gap by comparing tactile, auditory, and visual error feedback in a user study with 16 cognitively impaired workers. The results reveal that visual error feedback leads to a significantly faster assembly time compared to tactile error feedback. Further, we discuss design implications for providing error feedback for workers with cognitive impairments. © 2016 ACM.",Assistive systems; Augmented reality; Cognitively impaired workers; Error feedback; Multimodal interfaces,ASSETS 2016 - Proceedings of the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility,2016,Conference,Kosch T.; Kettner R.; Funk M.; Schmidt A.,10.1145/2982142.2982157
A platform for subjective image quality evaluation on mobile devices,"From content creators, to content distributors and consumer electronics industry, image quality is an important consideration both from an engineering and artistic point of view. In recent years, with the shift towards mobile multimedia, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to assess the quality of images displayed on mobile devices. In this paper we present an iOS app that makes it easy to perform subjective image quality evaluation on mobile devices. The app implements two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test methodology, and further reduces the cognitive load of subjects performing the test by providing an easy-to-use, natural interface using the mobile device's touch screen.

Integrating sports psychology into a human factors framework,"The emergence of cross-disciplinary research among the many sub disciplines of psychology is an encouraging trend. In sports psychology alone, the discoveries made in areas such as stress and performance, emotional and cognitive states, and situations could he of immense use to teams in both military and industrial contexts. However, while an abundance of work is being done on sports, sports teams, and teamwork, an integrative framework for this plethora of research is missing. We suggest that one of the greatest contributions that human factors research could provide to sports psychology is such an integrative theoretical framework. Therefore, after defining the key constructs used in this paper, we present the Input-Process-Emergent States-Outcome model.

"Mental workload in medicine: Foundations, applications, open problems, challenges and future perspectives","Mental workload is a design concept borrowed from Ergonomics with a significant adoption in the aviation and automobile industries. Nowadays, the consideration of this construct is also taking place in many modern clinical working environments for designing interacting and complex systems that impose ever greater cognitive demand on operators and less physical load. Measuring mental workload is essential for improving the interaction human-system, enhancing performance, reducing the operator's error and increasing safety. However, defining, measuring, assessing mental workload and understanding how this impinges on performance are still open problems. This secondary research is firstly aimed at introducing the construct of mental workload, its foundations, measurements techniques as well as applications in medicine. It then discusses open problems for applied research and eventually, it concludes with a list of challenges for scholars and practitioners. The goal is to provide the reader with a picture of the state of the science of mental workload in medicine and clinical domains with an eye towards future research. © 2016 IEEE.",Critical systems; Healt-care; Medicine; Mental workload; Safety; System design,Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems,2016,Conference,Longo L.,10.1109/CBMS.2016.36
Cross-domain 5G network management for seamless industrial communications,"Emerging scenarios of vertical industries, such as, adaptive manufacturing, cooperative autonomous driving, and real-time logistics demand for seamless communication among mobile entities, among them ground conveyors, user terminals, cars, or sensors. In practice, this leads to challenging requirements in terms of latency, bandwidth, availability, reliability, etc. that current mobile communications technologies, including cellular networks and IEEE 802-based solutions, do not fully account for. When deployed individually, neither of them fulfills the broad range of requirements, whereas a coordinated co-deployment suffers from the lack of efficient network management solutions as well as from insufficiently defined operating and owner structures for these mixed system deployments. Therefore, this work proposes a concept for an intelligent cross-domain 5G network management system and related optimization functions. In particular, the design of a cognitive, joint management of mobile industrial and cellular networks is outlined. Further, cognitive methods and virtualization techniques are motivated as major enablers. Advantages include an operator-grade network management of local industrial networks as well as a seamless integration with cellular networks. Following 5G design principles, the suggested network management system is also extensible to emerging radio access technologies (RATs) in the 5G context. © 2016 IEEE.",,Proceedings of the NOMS 2016 - 2016 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium,2016,Conference,Mannweiler C.; Schmelz L.C.; Lohmüller S.; Bauer B.,10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502917
CSA EXP248: Pipeline human factors,"Human Factors play an important role in the reduction of pipeline incidents. There has been little guidance specific to the Pipeline Industry related to Human Factors management, with the exception of Control Room Management, in the recent past. The Human Factors Working Group, formed during the 2013 Banff Pipeline Workshop, partnered with CSA Group to fill an identified gap in the industry related to Pipeline Human Factors. The result was the creation of an Express Document, CSA EXP248 Pipeline Human Factors. CSA EXP248 (EXP248) considers Human Factors through the life cycle of a pipeline asset. The main goal of this document is to improve pipeline safety performance through management of risks associated with Human Factors. It provides guidance to pipeline operators on the need and means to integrate Human Factors in all aspects of the Pipeline Life Cycle and Management System, with philosophy considerations for integration of Human Factors into a ""fit for service"" pipeline system. A review of EXP248 will illustrate how this document provides information that is scalable to organizations based on size and complexity. This paper reviews the new CSA Group Express Document process and its application for the Pipeline Industry. This paper will discuss kkey aspects of EXP248 that operators could apply and practical tips on the application of this guidance to the pipeline operating community. Areas highlighted during this review include elements of a Human Factors program, consideration of physical, organizational and cognitive demands of a job or task, and integration of Human Factors into Management Systems. Finally, the paper will describe next steps to create a CSA Group consensus standard for Pipeline Human Factors, where EXP248 will serve as a seed document.

A field examination of the moderating role of group trust in group efficacy formation,"Although support for the positive effect of group efficacy on group performance is copious, our understanding of how group efficacy forms is scant. Much remains unanswered about how the four efficacy antecedents, defined by social cognitive theory as enacted mastery, vicarious learning, social persuasion, and affect, concurrently influence group efficacy. Complementing the homology assumption of social cognitive theory, the authors propose and test a differential moderation model of group trust, in which group trust interacts synergistically or compensatorily with the four antecedents of group efficacy depending on the information content they provide. The results, based on 100 work groups in a manufacturing plant in China, showed that past group performance and group social persuasion were positively related to group efficacy, but that group vicarious learning and group positive affect were not. A significant interaction with group trust was found for group vicarious learning and for group positive affect. Finally, group efficacy was positively related to subsequent group performance, even after controlling for the four efficacy antecedents and group trust. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Practitioner points: Group efficacy is a significant predictor of group performance.

Influence of information overload on operator’s user experience of human–machine interface in LED manufacturing systems,"This paper reports on an experimental study on human–machine interface in LED manufacturing systems to measure the influence of information overload on user experience. The results are based on cognitive ergonomics. The experiment used eye-tracking methods and a questionnaire to gather data. The independent variables were interface complexity and user background. Interface complexity had three levels: high interface complexity, moderate interface complexity and low interface complexity. User background had two levels: the novice group and the expert group. The dependent variables included time to first fixation, fixations before and subjective feelings. A total of 38 operators participated in the experiment, and the results showed that (1) interface complexity caused a significant difference in time to first fixation (P < 0.05) and fixations before (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the results revealed significant differences between high complexity interfaces compared to low complexity interfaces (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between moderate and low complexity interfaces or between moderate and high complexity interfaces (P > 0.05); (2) user background significantly affected the user experience; (3) within the same complexity level, expert operators’ cognitive workload was significantly lower than that of novice operators; and (4) there was no significant relationship between the interface complexity and the user’s background. The study concludes that because interface complexity has a significant effect on the time taken to locate the target button on the screen, interface design should be as simple as possible, while still providing the necessary level of functionality. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.",Eye tracking; Human–machine interface; Information overload; LED manufacturing systems; User experience,"Cognition, Technology and Work",2016,Journal,Wu L.; Zhu Z.; Cao H.; Li B.,10.1007/s10111-015-0352-0
"Modeling the complexity of the relationship (Lean, company, employee and cognitive ergonomics) case of Moroccan SMEs","The feedback on the implementation of Lean confirms a gap between the real work and prescribed work and a negative impact of Lean on employees in terms of stress. These results allow considering in practice, ergonomic interventions to ensure the effective functioning of Lean while preserving the mental health and safety of operators. In this paper, we propose a model to explain the complexity of the relationship ""Lean, Company, Employee, & Cognitive Ergonomics."" Through this model, we will address, first, the Lean as an organization which has positive impacts on humans but also generates stress. Then we analyze the effect of the Lean on the company as an organization that improves the performance but we stress in the same sense the complexity of the relationship ""stress & performance"" knowing that Lean generates stress.

The Knowledge-based tools for the steel industry,"During last years, the evolution of process supervision shifted from a rule-base-oriented to a knowledge-base-oriented approach, where the automation systems relieve the human operator from most tedious and repetitive low-level information manipulation tasks; knowledge is considered more important than man by the introduction of applications for strict process control and tools for decision. In this context, Danieli Automation set itself a goal to design a new generation of supervision and control systems, which could provide added value to the operation of plant areas, taking advantage of recent advancements in user interface and information technology. These goals were met by creating new applications in which the know-how is transferred from operators to automation systems and the humanmachine interfaces are optimized in order to improve the quality of the operator work, making decisions faster and more accurate. The result is an innovative man-machine interface, called OPERATOR ASSISTANT. This paper aims to explain all the studies that have been done to develop this new tool, from ergonomics to the choice of the development platform, passing through the decision for the multitouch technology, the minimization of complexity, the consideration of cultural factors and the restraint of the emotional stress for the user.

Shared presence and collaboration using a co-located humanoid robot,"This work proposes the concept of shared presence, where we enable a user to ""become"" a co-located humanoid robot while still being able to use their real body to complete tasks. The user controls the robot and sees with its vision and sen-sors, while still maintaining awareness and use of their real body for tasks other than controlling the robot. This shared presence can be used to accomplish tasks that are difficult for one person alone, for example, a robot manipulating a circuit board for easier soldering by the user, lifting and manipulat-ing heavy or unwieldy objects together, or generally having the robot conduct and complete secondary tasks while the user focuses on the primary tasks. If people are able to over-come the cognitive difficulty of maintaining presence for both themselves and a nearby remote entity, tasks that typi-cally require the use of two people could simply require one person assisted by a humanoid robot that they control. In this work, we explore some of the challenges of creating such a system, propose research questions for shared presence, and present our initial implementation that can enable shared presence. We believe shared presence opens up a new re-search direction that can be applied to many fields, including manufacturing, home-assistant robotics, and education. © 2015 ACM.",Human augmentation; Human-robot interactions; Interfaces; Mixed reality; Robot control; Shared presence; Telepresence,HAI 2015 - Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction,2015,Conference,Wentzel J.; Rea D.J.; Young J.E.; Sharlin E.,10.1145/2814940.2814995
Measuring situational awareness at the small unit tactical level,"The purpose of this study is to propose and validate a method to measure the value of situational awareness at the small-unit tactical level. Currently, the Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) is widely considered the best method for measuring situational awareness. However, research on situational awareness is largely focused at the command post level and above, and implementations of SAGAT do not address operations at the small-unit level. In today's Army, technology is a more critical component of modern warfare used to increase the information available to decision makers at all levels. It is presumed that increased levels of available information will facilitate more efficient and effective decisions. However, there are corresponding concerns that such increases will potentially overwhelm the decision maker. We conducted a controlled experiment using the Nett Warrior system and Virtual Battlefield Simulation, Version 2 (VBS2), incorporating a modified form of SAGAT, the Tactical Situational Awareness Test (TSAT), and the principles of cognitive engineering and human factors studies to measure a user's situational awareness. This study finds that TSAT can measure situational awareness at the small-unit tactical level and validates that Nett Warrior increases situational awareness of soldiers in tactical operations. © 2015 IEEE.",Nett Warrior; SAGAT; simulation integration; situational awareness; TSAT,"2015 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2015",2015,Conference,Bew G.; Baker A.; Goodman D.; Nardone O.; Robinson M.,10.1109/SIEDS.2015.7117010
Productivity and ergonomic risk in human based production systems: A job-rotation scheduling model,"The competitiveness of modern manufacturing systems is based on a high production rate and a high level of flexibility. Despite the high level of automation achieved in production systems, flexibility is often provided by human dexterity and the cognitive capabilities of the workforce, as in assembly lines. In the case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In these contexts, a high production rate leads to high physical workload, and job rotation is adopted in order to reduce the ergonomic risk. Traditionally, ergonomics and human performance issues have been investigated separately. However, in the design and scheduling of human-based manufacturing systems, a reliable description of human components is required in order to jointly evaluate production system performance and assess workers risk of MSDs In this paper, the authors propose a model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is a mixed integer programming model allowing for the maximization of production rate jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the OCRA (OCcupational Repetitive Actions) method (ISO 11228-3:2007), widely recognized as an effective tool for the risk assessment of Upper Limb Work related MSDs (UL-WMSDs).

Organizational energy: A behavioral analysis of human and organizational factors in manufacturing,"This paper seeks to explore the behavior and embodied energy involved in the decision-making of information technology/information systems (IT/IS) investments using a case within a small- to medium-sized manufacturing firm. By analyzing decision making within a given case context, this paper describes the nature of the investment through the lens of behavioral economics, causality, input-output (IO) equilibrium, and the general notion of depletion of executive energy function. To explore the interplay between these elements, the authors structure the case context via a morphological field in order to construct a fuzzy cognitive map of decision-making relationships relating to the multidimensional and nonquantifiable problems of IT/IS investment evaluation. Noting the significance of inputs and outputs relating to the investment decision within the case, the authors assess these cognitive interrelationships through the lens of the Leontief IO energy equilibrium model. Subsequently, the authors suggest, through an embodied energy audit, that all such management decisions are susceptible to decision fatigue (so-called 'ego depletion'). The findings of this paper highlight pertinent cognitive and IO paths of the investment decision-making process that will allow others making similar types of investments to learn from and draw parallels from such processes. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Behavior; decision making; embodied energy; energy equilibrium model; fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM); information systems (IS); manufacturing; organizations; people; relationships,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2015,Journal,Irani Z.; Sharif A.M.; Papadopoulos T.,10.1109/TEM.2015.2402215
A Behavioral Intervention for Reducing Postcompletion Errors in a Safety-Critical System,"Objective: We investigated the effectiveness of a theoretically motivated intervention at reducing procedural errors in train yard operations, where making these errors could be costly or life-threatening. Background: A widespread and persistent memory error that people commit on a daily basis is the postcompletion error (PCE), that is, forgetting to complete the final step of a procedural task in which the final step occurs after completion of the task goal. PCEs occur in the railroad industry when a locomotive conductor changes the direction of a rail switch but fails to report this change. This particular error could contribute to unsafe conditions as another train traveling on the same track could derail. Although training can help reduce some of the factors leading to unsafe conditions on the rail, research has demonstrated that PCEs are different from other errors of omission in that they cannot be eliminated through training, which makes them a difficult problem to address. Method: Twenty-eight undergraduates completed train yard tasks within a mid-fidelity simulator used in commercial rail operations for training. Each participant received the behavioral intervention in one block and no intervention in another. Specifically, participants were required to perform an additional task designed to remind participants of the postcompletion step. Results: Our intervention significantly reduced PCE rates in the context of train yard operations, on average by 65%. Conclusion: We discuss implications of the effectiveness of our intervention at reducing train yard accidents and how this outcome can contribute to the literature on the cause of PCEs. Application: In cases such as the railroad industry, where redesigning technology is prohibitive, our behavioral intervention is an effective alternative for significantly reducing PCEs. © Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 2015.",applied cognition; attention; errors of omission; human-systems integration; memory; procedural errors; rail human factors; resilience engineering; retrieval cues; simulation,Human Factors,2015,Journal,McDonald J.D.; Durso F.T.,10.1177/0018720815584232

Learn but work! towards self-directed learning at mobile assembly workplaces,"In comparison to other work domains and to the current state of research, we face on the manufacturing shop oor little attention for the role of informal learning as key driver for manual assembly processes. There, smart assistance systems focus on process qualities and outcomes, not on the workers' abilities to cope with novel or uncertain work situations. In this paper we present a conceptual approach on how to integrate cognitive automation and self-directed learning at the assembly workplace. We argue for embedding smart learning behavior, based on the model of cognitive apprenticeship and provided by a cognitive architecture, with existing cognitive automation approaches. The conceptual approach is illustrated with the Plant@Hand smart assembly assistant prototype for the industrial assembly workplace. © 2015 ACM.",Cognitive architecture; Cognitive automation; Learning interfaces,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2015,Conference,Aehnelt M.; Wegner K.,10.1145/2809563.2809577
A model for situational awareness in aircraft upset prevention and recovery,"Situational awareness (SA) is defined as the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their status in the near future. Pilots understand that to fly an aircraft safely and to make timely effective decisions requires a high level of SA - awareness of myriad elements including personal wellness, alertness, proficiency, aircraft capabilities, systems and fuel status, traffic, ATC instructions, and weather, etc. Through experience, pilots formulate mental models - highly organized dynamic knowledge structures representing elements of the real world - which ease cognitive workload. A pilot, through experience develops a robust understanding of what a normal landing should look and feel like or how a specific emergency should be handled. Pilots must actively (e.g. through scan) and passively be attentive to the elements and cues that will allow them to achieve their current objectives. Under routine circumstances, pilots have ample time to redirect SA attention requirements to suit changing priorities or goals. However, when an aircraft Loss-of-Control Inflight (LOC-I) event such as an aircraft upset occurs or is imminent, not only must SA be high to start, but the pilot must be able to redirect SA tasks within a “critical window” of safe recovery. This paper will address some of the elements of SA required for prevention of, and if necessary, successful recovery from an aircraft upset. These elements include knowledge of aircraft performance capabilities, awareness of current maneuvering potential and energy state, spatial (e.g. altitude above the ground) and attitude awareness in a very dynamic environment, preexisting cognitive models (schemata or scripts) for correct recovery procedures for different types of upsets, including pattern matching for visual and other sensory cueing in extremes of bank and pitch. Environmental cues, often changing rapidly, activate these mental models. The pilot must have an idea of how an upset and associated recovery will “look and feel.” Correct and timely action by the pilot while controlling acute stress levels hinges on high preexisting SA and rapid redirection of attention oriented to upset prevention and recovery. Extensive experience in the delivery of aircraft and simulator Upset Prevention and Recovery Training to military and corporate pilots and established industry human factors principles will be used to illustrate how a properly constructed training environment is critical for a pilot to formulate the basis for this type of SA. © 2015 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Exploring individual-work context fit in affecting employee creativity in technology-based companies,"The increasing competition in knowledge-intensive economy has made it even more important for technological companies to understand what determines employee creativity since it is a major source for corporate innovation. Research has indicated that individual attribute substantially determines employee creativity, but only few empirical studies have incorporated the influence of contextual factors by taking an interactionist perspective. To extend the current understanding of creativity in technological companies, this study examines the relationship between individual dispositions (innovative cognitive style and proactive personality) and employee creativity, and the moderating role of two critical working conditions (work discretion and time pressure). Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the proposed hypotheses for a sample of 344 middle-level managers in Taiwanese manufacturing companies, including R&D managers and marketing managers. Middle managers were chosen as representative sample of company employees because their tasks in both departments of a large manufacturing company are relatively creativity-intensive in nature, compared to ordinary employees or managers in other logistics-oriented divisions. Results reveal that work discretion strengthens the effect of proactive personality on creativity whereas time pressure weakens the effect of innovative cognitive style on creativity. This paper contributes to the literature by disentangling the extant gaps among creativity theories and emphasizing the importance of individual-context fit to creativity in work settings. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Creativity; Environment condition; Innovative cognition; Proactive personality,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2015,Journal,Chen M.-H.; Chang Y.-Y.; Chang Y.-C.,10.1016/j.techfore.2015.05.002
Towards manufacturing 2.0: An innovative architecture for the Factory of the Future,"Industrial manufacturing processes today show an exponential complexity growth rate and the human operator are flooded by an overwhelming complexity and information. In addition, the higher and higher production rates enforced in modern production plants do not allow any human operator to control the process efficiently with traditional tools. Therefore, innovative paradigms and technologies to cope with manufacturing processes must be explored, mainly based on massive adoption of ICT solutions. Inspired by the most recent advances in information and communication technologies developed in the Future Internet framework and, in particular, in the PLATINO project, this paper presents an innovative architectural solution to improve the capabilities and performance of modern production plants: the so-called 'cognitive middleware for manufacturing'. This architectural paradigm aims at stressing the use and integration of ICT technologies (e.g. semantic, middleware, optimization algorithms,...) into an holistic framework to be transparently adopted into existing factories as well as embedded in the design of future ones. This solution has been formalized following the guidelines and expectations depicted in the MANUFUTURE Technology Platform SRA, the most valuable EU Organization performing research in this field and represents an innovative cross-fertilization between Future Internet and Future Manufacturing. © 2015 IEEE.",Cognitive Middleware; Future Internet; Manufacturing; Process Optimization,"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications, EuCNC 2015",2015,Conference,Fiaschetti A.; Pietrabissa A.; Delli Priscoli F.,10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194116
Cognitive Assistance in the Workplace,"These days, customers can choose and configure nearly every detail of a product they want to buy, making each manufactured product a unique piece rather than just another part in a large-scale production. The availability of such complex built-to-order systems is introducing a more complex manufacturing process, requiring more cognitive effort compared to the traditional built-to-stock approach. The manual-assembly workplace is thus becoming a challenging environment. To help the workers better manage such environments, the authors have built an assistive system that can be integrated directly into the workplace using in-situ projection for augmented reality.

The psychosocial risks of farm workers in south-east Spain,"This work used the FPSICO v.1 method of the Spanish National Institute of Safety and Hygiene to determine the possible psychosocial risks of farm workers in Almería-type greenhouses located in south-eastern Spain to propose health-condition improvements. A 75-question survey was used to evaluate seven psychosocial variables: cognitive load, temporal autonomy, job description, supervision-participation, role definition, worker interest, and personal relationships. A total of 548 workers were evaluated. Also, five qualitative characteristics (of workers) were identified: sex, age, greenhouse type, nationality, and crop type. None of the variables were associated with high psychosocial risk. Thus, the psychosocial health risks encountered by Almería-type greenhouse workers are acceptable, although optimisations over the mid and long term are necessary. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Agricultural workers; Health risks; Mental fatigue; Occupational health and safety,Safety Science,2015,Journal,Callejón-Ferre A.J.; Montoya-García M.E.; Pérez-Alonso J.; Rojas-Sola J.I.,10.1016/j.ssci.2015.04.015
Cognitive mapping links human factors to corporate strategies,"Human factors (HF) can improve business performance. Our objective is to harness individual tacit knowledge from senior directors about human factors as it relates to strategic goals and to make explicit their shared managerial thinking with an aim to identifying improvement opportunities using HF. Individual cognitive maps were drawn during one-hour interviews with seven senior directors of a large electronics firm. The maps were then merged on a common strategic goal of 'improving quality' into a group map containing 221 concepts and 900 loops. In a two hour workshop with the directors, reducing fatigue, improving systems design, and reducing repetitive activities were concepts that emerged as critical-to-quality. Workshop discussions identified untapped improvement opportunities. Directors viewed the maps as a dynamic indicator of their HF performance. Making the connection between HF and strategic goals explicit can help an organisation identify opportunities to improve human, and therefore business, performance.

Processing manufacturing knowledge with ontology-based annotations and cognitive architectures,"Advanced manufacturing promises an evolution of industrial production processes. However, today's manufacturing systems lack a common strategy on how to combine factual, procedural, and conceptual knowledge in order to streamline production processes. This specifically applies for manufacturing assembly assistance where the major share of procedural and conceptual knowledge is not yet automatically processable. In our paper we propose the usage of ontology-based annotations as missing link between the tacit knowledge of the worker and the intelligent assistance system. We show the deeper integration of conceptual knowledge modeled in ontology-based annotations with procedural knowledge in cognitive architectures. Additionally, in our approach annotations act as a mean of communication between the workers and with the system. We show key aspects of a prototypical integration of our approach within a smart assembly assistance system which supplies the worker with task related information. © 2015 ACM.",Cognitive architecture; Context; Digital annotations; Manufacturing; Ontology,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2015,Conference,Alm R.; Aehnelt M.; Urban B.,10.1145/2809563.2809576
Introducing Customized ICT for Operators in Manufacturing,Higher complexity and increased global competition emphasises the need of flexibility for organisations in manufacturing. To achieve this puts challenges on todays manufacturing systems and the human operators doing the tasks. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as cognitive automation and to increase information sharing among the operators has been discussed as important tools to meet those challenges. A highly customized mobile application was developed at a large Swedish manufacturing company. This application has been introduced on smartphone devices to the operators in a manufacturing process. This paper presents empirical findings from the first year of this test. The study provides an example where information and communication technology have enabled manufacturing operators to perform new work tasks through increased trust and knowledge. © 2016 The Authors.,Cognitive automation; Flexibility; ICT; Information sharing; Manufacturing,Procedia CIRP,2016,Conference,Åkerman M.; Fast-Berglund Å.; Karlsson M.; Stahre J.,10.1016/j.procir.2015.12.074
A group decision-making approach to uncertain quality function deployment based on fuzzy preference relation and fuzzy majority,"Quality function deployment (QFD) is one of the very effective customer-driven quality system tools typically applied to fulfill customer needs or requirements (CRs). It is a crucial step in QFD to derive the prioritization of design requirements (DRs) from CRs for a product. However, effective prioritization of DRs is seriously challenged due to two types of uncertainties: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. This paper tries to propose a novel two-stage group decision-making approach to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD. The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers' fuzzy preference relations into an overall one by fuzzy majority. Two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing approaches. Implementation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and model customer heterogeneity and design team's preference. Due to its easiness, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in QFD planning. Extensions to the proposed approach are also given to address application contexts involving a wider set of HOQ elements. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.",Fuzzy majority; Fuzzy preference relation-; Group decision-making approach; QFD; Quality management; Uncertain,European Journal of Operational Research,2015,Journal,Yan H.-B.; Ma T.,10.1016/j.ejor.2014.09.017
Evaluation Framework for Virtual Training within Mixed-Mo del Manual Assembly,"The low volume-high variety strategy of the companies increases the need for well-trained operators. The operators have a much larger cognitive load than before and their expertise must be kept up to date at any time. To solve this problem, efficient training programs must be maintained. A physical replica of the real setting to perform an assembly training is often a too large investment. Therefore, a virtual replica is introduced in many cases. This paper gives an overview of reported experiments on virtual training for manual assembly. All experiments are classified based on some key elements: the evaluation method, the interaction interface and product complexity. An evaluation framework is proposed to compare different virtual training systems. This benchmark will be used in future research to determine the industrial usability of virtual training approaches for manual assembly in mixed-model environments. © 2016",Benchmark; Mixed-model Assembly; Operator; Virtual Reality; Virtual Training,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2016,Conference,Hoedt S.; Claeys A.; Van Landeghem H.; Cottyn J.,10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.614
Activity theory based context model: Application for enterprise intelligent assistant systems,"In dynamic working environments such as factory production lines, the process of decisionmaking combines different types of data and knowledge available in different forms. In many cases, elements impacting decisions are not totally mastered by the decision support system since the activity of the user is highly influenced by the dynamic change of the production system. Thus, in order to set the appropriate context elements surrounding different working situations of factory actors, this paper proposes a context model aiming to represents user's activity and the circumstances under the decisionmaking process. The literature of related works highlighted the advantages of context-awareness in supporting the dynamic adaptation of information according to user's context. The proposed model in this paper takes advantage from the context notion and the fundaments of the activity theory proposed in cognitive science. The intended model is used in an intelligent assistant system dedicated to assist factory workers in the manufacturing process. The main purpose of the context model is to help the assistant system in handling the process of knowledge adaptation and therefore, avoiding the problems of overload and misinterpretation of the information. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Applications of integrated human error identification techniques on the chemical cylinder change task,"This paper outlines the human error identification (HEI) techniques that currently exist to assess latent human errors. Many formal error identification techniques have existed for years, but few have been validated to cover latent human error analysis in different domains. This study considers many possible error modes and influential factors, including external error modes, internal error modes, psychological error mechanisms, and performance shaping factors, and integrates several execution procedures and frameworks of HEI techniques. The case study in this research was the operational process of changing chemical cylinders in a factory. In addition, the integrated HEI method was used to assess the operational processes and the system's reliability. It was concluded that the integrated method is a valuable aid to develop much safer operational processes and can be used to predict human error rates on critical tasks in the plant. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.",Human errors; Human reliability analysis; Safety management,Applied Ergonomics,2015,Journal,Cheng C.-M.; Hwang S.-L.,10.1016/j.apergo.2014.10.008
Application of robotics in offshore oil and gas industry-A review Part II,"Demands for oil and gas are increasing with urbanization and industrialization of the world's increasing population. Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution.

Design and Implementation of TeleAdvisor: a Projection-Based Augmented Reality System for Remote Collaboration,"TeleAdvisor is a versatile projection-based augmented reality system designed for remote collaboration. It allows a remote expert to naturally guide a local user in need of assistance in carrying out physical tasks around real-world objects. The system consists of a small projector and two cameras mounted on top of a tele-operated robotic arm at the worker’s side, and an interface to view the camera stream, control the point-of-view and gesture using projected annotations at the remote expert’s side. TeleAdvisor provides a hands-free, mobile, low-cost solution that supports gesturing by the remote expert while minimizing the cognitive overhead of the local worker.

Manufacturing at double the speed,"The speed of manufacturing processes today depends on a trade-off between the physical processes of production, the wider system that allows these processes to operate and the co-ordination of a supply chain in the pursuit of meeting customer needs. Could the speed of this activity be doubled? This paper explores this hypothetical question, starting with examination of a diverse set of case studies spanning the activities of manufacturing. This reveals that the constraints on increasing manufacturing speed have some common themes, and several of these are examined in more detail, to identify absolute limits to performance. The physical processes of production are constrained by factors such as machine stiffness, actuator acceleration, heat transfer and the delivery of fluids, and for each of these, a simplified model is used to analyse the gap between current and limiting performance. The wider systems of production require the co-ordination of resources and push at the limits of human biophysical and cognitive limits. Evidence about these is explored and related to current practice. Out of this discussion, five promising innovations are explored to show examples of how manufacturing speed is increasing - with line arrays of point actuators, parallel tools, tailored application of precision, hybridisation and task taxonomies. The paper addresses a broad question which could be pursued by a wider community and in greater depth, but even this first examination suggests the possibility of unanticipated innovations in current manufacturing practices.",Constraints; Manufacturing; Productivity; Speed,Journal of Materials Processing Technology,2015,Journal,Allwood J.M.; Childs T.H.C.; Clare A.T.; De Silva A.K.M.; Dhokia V.; Hutchings I.M.; Leach R.K.; Leal-Ayala D.R.; Lowth S.; Majewski C.E.; Marzano A.; Mehnen J.; Nassehi A.; Ozturk E.; Raffles M.H.; Roy R.; Shyha I.; Turner S.,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2015.10.028
The human factor in production planning and control: Considering human needs in computer aided decision-support systems,"The unawareness of production planners about the interaction of key performance indicators (KPIs) in manufacturing systems and misinterpretations of system states often leads to problems when they try to improve them. Exemplary, the lead time syndrome (LTS) represents one of these counterproductive actions. While planners aim to improve due date reliability by planned lead time adjustments, the result is often an aggravation of due date reliability. This is due to human behaviour in the decision-making process, which can be biased. Despite its potential to improve the logistic performance, human needs were out of scope of recent investigations in the field of logistics. The aim of this paper is to close this research gap by means of a case study and research on human behaviour in the field of psychology. The result is the determination of guidelines to improve the logistic performance in future decision-support systems by considering human needs.

A longitudinal investigation of work environment stressors on the performance and wellbeing of office workers,"This study uses a longitudinal within-subjects design to investigate the effects of inadequate Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) on work performance and wellbeing in a sample of 114 office workers over a period of 8 months. Participants completed a total of 2261 online surveys measuring perceived thermal comfort, lighting comfort and noise annoyance, measures of work performance, and individual state factors underlying performance and wellbeing. Characterising inadequate aspects of IEQ as environmental stressors, these stress factors can significantly reduce self-reported work performance and objectively measured cognitive performance by between 2.4% and 5.8% in most situations, and by up to 14.8% in rare cases. Environmental stressors act indirectly on work performance by reducing state variables, motivation, tiredness, and distractibility, which support high-functioning work performance. Exposure to environmental stress appears to erode individuals' resilience, or ability to cope with additional task demands. These results indicate that environmental stress reduces not only the cognitive capacity for work, but the rate of work (i.e. by reducing motivation). Increasing the number of individual stress factors is associated with a near linear reduction in work performance indicating that environmental stress factors are additive, not multiplicative. Environmental stressors reduce occupant wellbeing (mood, headaches, and feeling 'off') causing indirect reductions in work performance. Improving IEQ will likely produce small but pervasive increases in productivity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.",Light; Noise annoyance; Stress; Thermal comfort; Wellbeing; Work performance,Applied Ergonomics,2016,Journal,Lamb S.; Kwok K.C.S.,10.1016/j.apergo.2015.07.010
Effect of cognitive automation in a material handling system on manufacturing flexibility,"Manufacturing flexibility has become a competitive strategy to deal with market uncertainty. The application of advanced automation technology in manufacturing systems has tremendously increased manufacturing flexibility; however, this creates significant mental pressure for operators who must deal with a series of decisions, and this decreases their job satisfaction. In this study, we primarily investigated how cognitive automation and mechanical automaton in the material handling system affect manufacturing flexibility. Cognitive automation is defined as a computerized system that provides relevant information to operators, thereby reducing the cognitive workload; mechanical automation refers to an automated system to reduce the physical workload. The case of a truck-body production line of a truck company was investigated by applying modified DYNAMO++ for the material handling system. Then, a simulation program, AnyLogic 6.9.0 was used to investigate the effect of the cognitive and mechanical automation in the material handling system on manufacturing flexibility. The research results showed that the levels of cognitive and mechanical automation of the material handling system were increased by 52.4% and 48.0%, respectively, which resulted in improving manufacturing flexibility by 14.2% in cycle time, 53.3% in downtime, and 26.3% in the number of tasks. Cognitive automation, in particular, contributed total improvements in cycle time and downtime of 64.2% and 74.1%, respectively, which showed that cognitive automation has a very critical effect on manufacturing flexibility in the material handling system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Performance in Tangible and in Cognitive Stock-Flow Tasks: Closer Than Expected,"Background. Most research in the area of dynamic decision making in general and stock-flow failures in particular is conducted with the help of computerized simulations as task environments or paper-based tasks of simple dynamic systems. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to investigate if stock-flow failures persist in naturalistic decision making environments. Methods. For this purpose, a tangible stock-flow experiment is used. It asks participants to meet a target level of water in a glass by pouring water through a funnel as fast as possible. We then compare their performance with a purely cognitive task (a manufacturing task). Results. Participants on average did not significantly perform better in a tangible stock-flow task than in a paper-based test of a comparable task. In addition, individual performance in the tangible task cannot be related to performance in a similar paper-pencil stock-flow task. Conclusions. An implication of this study is that tangible stock-flow tasks are as difficult for humans to control as are purely cognitive tasks.

Cognitive computing based manufacturing data processing for internet of things in job-shop floor,"The internet of things (IOT) technology is introduced to the job-shop floor to address the barriers between upper management system and the underlying field automation systems, but also brings new problems, namely, the production management data appears explosive growth. For solving this problem, a data processing methodology based on cognitive computing and cognitive informatics is presented. By simulating the human brain information processing to eye, ears, hands, nose, tongue and other sensory organs, the data of job-shop floor IOT is divided into seven layers from bottom to top, and those layers is classified to passive data acquisition layer and active data acquisition layer. Active data acquisition process consists of three phases. The manufacturing data, manufacturing information and manufacturing knowledge are respectively acquired in three phases, and stored in the corresponding type of database in order to realize the fast reading and updating in different ways. Manufacturing information and manufacturing knowledge based on different granularity are also divided into different levels to meet the job-shop floor IOT management requirements for quick and correct decision-making. This methodology not only effectively reduces the scale of job-shop floor IOT management data, but also gives out different judgments for manufacture problems according to different response time requirements. What's more, five key enabling technologies are described in detail, that is, layered reference model of data, the database function model, data processing stage division, manufacturing information acquisition model and manufacturing knowledge hierarchical model. © 2015 IEEE.",cognitive computing; data processing; information management; internet of things; job-shop floor,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation, ICMA 2015",2015,Conference,Wang C.; Jiang P.,10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237883
Artificial cognitive control with self-x capabilities: A case study of a micro-manufacturing process,"Nowadays, even though cognitive control architectures form an important area of research, there are many constraints on the broad application of cognitive control at an industrial level and very few systematic approaches truly inspired by biological processes, from the perspective of control engineering. Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept. The proof of concept of force control yields good transient responses, short settling times and acceptable steady-state error. The artificial cognitive control architecture built into a low-cost computing platform demonstrates the suitability of its implementation in an industrial setup. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Towards a taxonomy of errors in PLC programming,"Based on previous studies on programming errors and their causes, the presented paper investigates errors that application engineers in the area of machine and plant automation make while creating either function block diagrams, plcML [an adaption of the unified modelling language (UML)] or modAT4rMS code (a newly developed modelling language that adapts and combines aspects of UML and SysML). A laboratory-based study with 52 mechatronics apprentices and electrical engineering technicians with knowhow in manufacturing system design but comparably undeveloped programming skills has been conducted, in which the subjects’ errors and think-aloud statements during code creation were recorded. In a subsequent step, these data have been analysed by the cognitive causes of the coding errors applying the skill-rules-knowledge framework. As a result, a taxonomy of errors is presented. Results indicate that most of the errors in the subjects’ code are due to insufficient understanding of the notation’s syntax, problems with the rules of encapsulation, the creation of modules and finally with the creation of variants and aggregations, which are all located at the rule-based level. Errors at the skill-based level mainly occurred during behavioural modelling with modAT4rMS. It is argued that the provided insights can be used for improving education on programmable logic controller (PLC) languages and for the design of tools that support PLC programmers at detecting and fixing errors within their code. © 2014, The Author(s).",Automation; Errors; Human factors; Object-oriented methods; Software engineering,"Cognition, Technology and Work",2015,Journal,Duschl K.C.; Gramß D.; Obermeier M.; Vogel-Heuser B.,10.1007/s10111-014-0307-x
Industrial timber house building - Levels of automation,"Swedish industrial timber house building faces a constantly increasing housing demand. In order to respond to the demand, companies in this sector, have to improve their businesses in terms of productivity. At the same time, they need to meet customer requirements, i.e., offering flexible building solutions, thus creating a balance between productivity and flexibility. Off-site assembly of exterior walls is an essential part of the house production, and cutting down lead times at this phase hence, increases the competitiveness. If introduced in a right way, automation can contribute to a higher productivity. Thus, right levels of both physical and cognitive automation are necessary. The objective of this study is to measure the current levels of automation (LoA) within the off-site exterior wall assembly. Research design consisted of a literature study and a case study that was conducted at a Swedish company that is an engineer-to-order producer of single-family timber houses. A case study design was made according to the DYNAMO ++ framework. The framework was used in the assessment of LoA and designing flexible task allocation in many manufacturing industries, but there is a lack of knowledge on how to use this method in the industrial timber house building. The average physical and cognitive LoA of 124 identified tasks are 3 and 1 respectively. Increased physical and cognitive LoA for critical tasks would enable flexible task allocation between human operators and technology. It is believed that this type of flexibility can result in less production disturbances and higher productivity when a high variety of exterior walls is assembled.",Exterior wall; Hierarchical task analysis; Off-site assembly; Physical and cognitive levels of automation; Single-family timber house,ISARC 2016 - 33rd International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction,2016,Conference,Popovic D.; Winroth M.,10.22260/isarc2016/0057
Reflections on societal and business model transformation arising from digitization and big data analytics: A research agenda,"In the era of accelerating digitization and advanced big data analytics, harnessing quality data for designing and delivering state-of-the-art services will enable innovative business models and management approaches (Boyd and Crawford, 2012; Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014) and yield an array of consequences. Among other consequences, digitization and big data analytics reshape business models and impact employment amongst knowledge workers - just as automation did for manufacturing workers. This Viewpoint paper considers the mechanisms underlying how digitization and big data analytics drive the transformation of business and society and outlines the potential effects of digitization and big data analytics on employment - especially in the context of cognitive tasks. Its aim is to outline a critical research agenda to explore and conceptualize evident changes in business models and society arising from these technological advances. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Application of robotics in onshore oil and gas industry-A review Part i,"With ever increasing global demand and depleting resources for fossil fuels, oil and gas industry is now positively looking for advanced robotic solutions to increase their productivity and safety. With time easy resources of the fossil fuels are shrinking and newly searched reservoirs, to feed supply demands of global consumption, are mostly located in extreme environmental conditions such as hot deserts, deep water and arctic zone etc. Production of the fossil fuels, in such inhospitable environmental conditions, poses difficult challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE). Tragic incidents like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills are examples of such challenges. Therefore, oil and gas industry has lot to learn from successful implementation of robotics and automation for dull, dirty and dangerous (3D) tasks of manufacturing industry. Most of the robotics technologies, currently used in the oil and gas industry, are mainly focused on inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) of plant facilities with higher frequency and accuracy. Fundamental idea, involved in the automatization of these processes, is based on the principle of teleoperation with skilled operator. Automation of 3D tasks not only improves HSE standards but also lead to much needed economic efficiency by reducing production cycle, floor space and number of staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the risks involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots, first without achieving very high reliability, is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots, where actions are performed by robots but cognitive decisions are still taken by skilled operator, is an excellent choice for this industry as a near future solution. In the onshore oil and gas industry robotic solutions are used both in upstream and downstream processes, such as site survey, drilling, production and transportation, mainly focused in the form of in-pipe inspection robots (IPIRs), tank inspection robots (TIRs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) etc. This paper presents the state of art robotic solutions currently used in onshore oil and gas facilities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Automation; In-pipe inspection robots; NDT; Oil and gas exploration; Robotics; Tank inspection robots; UAV; Wireless sensor networks (WSN),Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2016,Journal,Shukla A.; Karki H.,10.1016/j.robot.2015.09.012
"Effect of a real-time psychophysiological feedback, its display format and reliability on cognitive workload and performance","For a long time, literature has identified some psychophysiological metrics that proved reliable to assess cognitive states in controlled conditions. Smaller, more reliable and more affordable sensors made the industrial community plan to design systems that would adapt themselves to the ability of their users to operate them. Thus an important human factors question must be asked: what is the impact of such a feedback on users' performance and cognitive workload? Does the display format of this feedback have an influence over subjects? What if the feedback provides erroneous data? We designed a protocol to compare the influence of providing a cognitive load assessment gauge versus raw data versus no feedback in a Multiple Objects Tracking task. Reliability of this feedback was also evaluated. Performance in a dual task paradigm, pupil dilation and questionnaire were used to assess cognitive load. Trials duration and learning effect were used as control results. Raw feedback showed a negative effect while low reliability showed inconsistent results.

"On the Visual Design of ERP Systems The – Role of Information Complexity, Presentation and Human Factors","The investment in Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems is indispensable for manufacturing companies to obtain competitive advantages in the globalized market. However, end-users are confronted with complex interfaces and poor usability of these systems. In the present multi-factorial experiment, we examined the effects of information complexity and presentation as a key aspect of usability with consideration of human factors on decision quality. By using alphanumeric tables of simulated ERP system data to make a decision, users’ decision quality dropped with increasing information complexity and the use of a poor presentation. Furthermore, interactive effects of two different aspects of information complexity (data amount and task complexity) as well as compensatory effects through human factors were revealed. These findings show the importance of empirical user studies in this field and provide several practical implication. Especially, user-centered design processes can substantially contribute to a successful implementation of complex information systems, such as ERP systems. © 2015 The Authors",Alphanumeric displays; Cognitive abilities; Enterprise resource planning system (ERP); Human Factors; Information complexity; Information systems; Information visualization; Supply chain management; Tables; Usability; Usability for Industrial Internet; User diversity,Procedia Manufacturing,2015,Conference,Mittelstädt V.; Brauner P.; Blum M.; Ziefle M.,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.207
Learning force and position constraints in human-robot cooperative transportation,"Physical interaction between humans and robots arises a large set of challenging problems involving hardware, safety, control and cognitive aspects, among others. In this context, the cooperative (two or more people/robots) transportation of bulky loads in manufacturing plants is a practical example where these challenges are evident. In this paper, we address the problem of teaching a robot collaborative behaviors from human demonstrations. Specifically, we present an approach that combines: probabilistic learning and dynamical systems, to encode the robot's motion along the task. Our method allows us to learn not only a desired path to take the object through, but also, the force the robot needs to apply to the load during the interaction. Moreover, the robot is able to learn and reproduce the task with varying initial and final locations of the object. The proposed approach can be used in scenarios where not only the path to be followed by the transported object matters, but also the force applied to it. Tests were successfully carried out in a scenario where a 7 DOFs backdrivable manipulator learns to cooperate, with a human, to transport an object while satisfying the position and force constraints of the task. © 2014 IEEE.",,"IEEE RO-MAN 2014 - 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication: Human-Robot Co-Existence: Adaptive Interfaces and Systems for Daily Life, Therapy, Assistance and Socially Engaging Interactions",2014,Conference,Rozo L.; Calinon S.; Caldwell D.G.,10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926321

Exploring cognitive biases in project development in the petroleum industry,"Risk management has been a concern in the petroleum industry in recent years. How to establish sufficient safety barriers and reduce the risk for human error are regarded as central to manage the risk for major accidents. The purpose of this paper is to explore how cognitive biases might influence project development and management of risk for major accidents in the petroleum industry. An explorative survey of Human Factors studies in four typical large petroleum projects was performed. This included identification and assessment of sub-optimal design solutions, potential errors/near misses as well causes of these challenges. The outcome of the study indicates that different types of cognitive biases hinder effective integration of Human Factors in petroleum projects. It is evident that risk is perceived differently between different technical disciplines and across organizational levels due to difference in focuses, which again influences problem solving and decision-making. Mental models enforced by subjective experience and professional focus function as barriers against effective cooperation between disciplines and management, and thus against efficient integration of technical, operational and organizational barriers as a foundation for safe operations. Misconception of compliance to requirements and procedure, and misunderstanding of single technical barriers/solutions as sufficient safety barrier, was also identified as challenges in project development and mitigation of risk. Conclusively, it is necessary for the petroleum industry to recognize the existence of cognitive biases and its influence on the risk management. In addition, it is necessary to explore the concept of cognitive biases further, e.g. empirically, in order to establish strategies to reduce its effect on risk management. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Safety and Reliability of Complex Engineered Systems - Proceedings of the 25th European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2015",2015,Conference,Liu Y.; Ludvigsen J.T.,10.1201/b19094-398
A review of factor modification methods in human reliability analysis,"Frequent accidents caused by human factors in different industrial fields indicate that human reliability analysis (HRA) plays an important role in reducing and preventing human errors and thereby improving the reliability of human-machine system. Different from the mathematical model which can solve the precise in system reliability analysis, HRA focuses on the operator's erroneous actions and task context, this determines that human reliability should be analyzed by combining qualitative and quantitative methods. In order to objectively quantify human behavior and task context by HRA results, modifying factors are usually adopted to quantify the final human error probability (HEP) based on the qualitative analysis of the operator's erroneous actions and task context. A complete factor modification method consists of modifying factor selection, factor modification strategy and factor modification mechanism (mathematical logic of how the modifying factors influence HEP). In this paper, based on the analysis of connotation and selection of modifying factors in HRA methods and according to the distinctions among factor modifying objects in human reliability quantitative assessment, three kinds of factor modification strategies are generalized from factor modification methods in existing HRA methods and detailedly analyzed and reviewed as well, namely systemic-parameter-based, cognitive-behavior-based and simulation-based factor modification strategies. Meanwhile, the factor modification mechanism in before-mentioned factor modification methods are analyzed and summarized. © 2014 IEEE.",Factor modification method; Factor modification strategy; Human error probability; Human reliability analysis; Modifying factor,"ICRMS 2014 - Proceedings of 2014 10th International Conference on Reliability, Maintainability and Safety: More Reliable Products, More Secure Life",2014,Conference,Pan X.; He C.; Wen T.,10.1109/ICRMS.2014.7107233
"The Deepwater Horizon explosion: Non-technical skills, safety culture, and system complexity","The explosion and destruction of the Deepwater Horizon (DH) was a watershed moment for safety management in the US oil and gas industry. The 2011 National Oil Spill Commission investigation identified a range of operational behaviours and underlying safety management problems that were causal to the mishap. Yet, to date these have not been systematically considered within a human factors framework. To achieve this, we draw upon two applied psychology domains that are highly influential within safety research. First, we apply non-technical skills (NTS) (social and cognitive skills that underpin safe performance in complex work environments) theorem to understand operational activities in the lead-up and occurrence of the well blowout. NTS research is used to develop interventions for training and observing safety behaviours (e.g. decision-making, teamwork). Second, we apply safety culture theory to understand how the organisational and industry environment shaped the management of risk. Safety culture research is used to understand and change the socio-technical constraints and enablers of safety activity in high-risk workplaces. Finally, to integrate these perspectives, we take a systems-thinking perspective to understand the mishap. A common critique of accident narratives is their failure to systematically consider how the components of an incident interact together to escalate risk. From a systems-thinking perspective, understanding the interactions leading to the DH mishap is crucial for ensuring interventions are effective in preventing future mishaps. We develop an accident model that captures the various interactions and system factors leading to the blowout. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",accident analysis; Deepwater Horizon (DH); non-technical skills (NTS); psychology; safety culture; systems-thinking,Journal of Risk Research,2014,Journal,Reader T.W.; Oconnor P.,10.1080/13669877.2013.815652
Individual and work factors related to perceived work ability and labor force outcomes,"Perceived work ability refers to a worker's assessment of his or her ability to continue working in his or her job, given characteristics of the job along with his or her resources. Perceived work ability is a critical variable to study in the United States, given an aging workforce, trends to delay retirement, and U.S. policy considerations to delay the age at which full Social Security retirement benefits may be obtained. Based on the job demands-resources model, cognitive appraisal theory of stress, and push/pull factors related to retirement, we proposed and tested a conceptual model of antecedents and outcomes of perceived work ability using 3 independent samples of U.S. working adults. Data regarding workers' job characteristics were from self-report and Occupational Information Network measures. Results from relative importance analysis indicated that health and sense of control were consistently and most strongly related to work ability perceptions relative to other job demands and job and personal resources when perceived work ability was measured concurrently or 2 weeks later in samples with varying occupations. Job demands (along with health and sense of control) were most strongly related to work ability perceptions when perceived work ability was measured in a manufacturing worker sample 1.6 years later. Perceived work ability also predicted lagged labor force outcomes (absence, retirement, and disability leave) while controlling for other known predictors of each. Consistent indirect effects were observed from health status and sense of control to all 3 of these outcomes via perceived work ability.",Health and Retirement Study; Job demands-resources model; Older workers; Perceived work ability; Personal resources,Journal of Applied Psychology,2015,Journal,McGonagle A.K.; Fisher G.G.; Barnes-Farrell J.L.; Grosch J.W.,10.1037/a0037974
Transferring cognitive apprenticeship to manufacturing process knowledge management system: A case study of small- and medium-sized coating industry,"Purpose - This study aims to develop a manufacturing process management system which aims to benefit the excavation, collection and search of the mentors' experience and knowledge. The coating painting industry is a typical small and medium-sized traditional industry and usually depends on master's experience to solve the manufacturing problem. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the characteristics and manufacturing process of the architectural coating industry, this study develops a practical knowledge management system (KMS) with two stages. The first stage collects and analyzes manufacturing process data, and the second stage constructs the KMS of the manufacturing process. Findings - This manufacturing process KMS can accumulate and share the operators' experience and knowledge systematically; this KMS not only improves the apprentices' skill and problem-solving abilities but also enhances the enterprise's overall product quality, undoubtedly. Research limitations/implications - This manufacturing process KMS was designed to be implemented in architectural coating industry which is defined as a ""3K"" industry. Such a specific manufacturing process KMS is not a generalized principles system which is hard to apply to other industries because the different industries own different explicit and tacit knowledge which cannot be captured in this study simultaneously. Further research will try to design a more complete and integrated KMS for industry and combine it with other approaches such as TRIZ (Russian acronym for the theory of inventive problem solving), patent database and problem-solving tools. Practical implications - The developments of this manufacturing processKMSsoftware was based on systematic analysis and design. Using the architectural coating industry as an example, this system externalized the cognitive apprenticeship and developed a KMS based on the characteristics of the manufacturing process to preserve and share the valuable manufacturing process knowledge. Originality/value - The paper extends knowledge management's contribution to externalize the cognitive apprenticeship and develop a KMS. The adoption of this manufacturing process KMS enables employees to improve their techniques, skills and problem-solving abilities and enables companies to enhance the overall product quality. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Cognitive apprenticeship; Experience knowledge; Explicit knowledge; Manufacturing process knowledge management system; Tacit knowledge,VINE,2014,Journal,Cheng C.-Y.; Ou T.-Y.; Chen T.-L.; Chen Y.-Y.,10.1108/VINE-03-2013-0011
Importance of cognitive Human Factors in the safety management for petroleum industry,"In recent petroleum accident investigation, more focus has been given to Human Factors (HF) in the technology-driven petroleum industry. In order to investigate the status of HF implementation in Norwegian petroleum industry as well as consequences related to safety management, a HF investigation study was conducted in design of four control centers. It was found that HF is poorly prioritized, and HF experts and focus are often missing from user organizations. The missing HF focus is impacting safety and resilience and creating holes in barriers that may lead to later incidents or accidents. HF must focus on cognitive and organizational factors from the start, not only physical ergonomics. Organizations should have competence to involve HF experts. Exploring critical scenarios prior to the design phases is necessary. Validation and verification from certified HF experts should be performed as early as possible. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Safety and Reliability of Complex Engineered Systems - Proceedings of the 25th European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2015",2015,Conference,Johnsen S.O.; Liu Y.,10.1201/b19094-388
Multi-response ergonomic design of human-CNC machine interface,"This work is aimed at enriching a research theme, focused on exploiting the performance in a human-computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine interface (HCMI) environment. A salient contribution of this research effort is focused on adopting the concept of load cell for the system of human-performance measurement. The developed novel system is capable of measuring cognitive and motor action responses simultaneously. The performance measurement system designed for this work may be replicated for other fields where systems are operated through control panels and also where responses of mentally retarded human-beings (or the human beings with the symptoms of Alzheimer disease) are to be observed and evaluated. As regard to the evaluation and trustworthiness of the designed research, search time, motor action time and applied force were selected as response variables to evaluate the CNC machine operator's performance. Based on Taguchi's experimental design, a full factorial design consisting of 27 (33) experiments was used to collect the data for human performances. The collected data were analyzed using grey relational analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and F-test. ANOVA was carried out using Design-Expert software. The designed research has achieved a reasonable degree of validity through performing confirmation test. This study has presented an effective approach for the optimization of the HCMI environment with multi-performance characteristics based on the combined Taguchi method and Grey relational analysis. Relevance to industry: The findings of this work are directly applicable to the practical field to improve the design of a CNC-machines system. This work suggests that those responsible for the functioning and operation of CNC-machines workstations would have to redesign the system to reduce musculoskeletal injuries and other related problems. The present results can be quite useful for future system designers. It is emphasized that applying ergonomic principles to the design of CNC machines and interfaces can not only help to enhance machine performance and productivity but can also enable the human operator to feel comfortable and secure. As most companies have acquired automated manufacturing technology in recent years to be competitive, ergonomic and safety considerations are of the utmost importance. © 2013 Springer-Verlag France.",Applied force; CNC-environment; Load cell; Motor action time; Multi-performance; Search time,International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing,2014,Journal,Khan I.A.,10.1007/s12008-013-0190-3
Influence of Different Types of Vibrations on Technical Acceptance of a Mobile Game Aiming for Hedonic Satisfaction,"Rapid increases in the smartphone gaming industry have made in-game usability increasingly important. However, industrial usability is still focused on performance although high performance is not necessarily a goal in actual games. Mobile gamers largely want to increase their hedonic satisfaction. So already established usability guidelines can fail in mobile gaming. Focusing on vibrations as a haptic feedback, this study analyzed the influences of intensity and length of vibrations on user perceptions based on the technology acceptance model aiming for hedonic satisfaction when mobile gaming. A smartphone game was modified to generate seven types of vibrations for a human factors experiment with 70 subjects and administered a questionnaire to measure their perceptions of the game influenced by the vibrations. The results show that including vibrations significantly increases the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and cognitive concentration in the game. The stronger vibration intensity significantly improves user perceptions of the usefulness and cognitive concentration, whereas the length of vibration is not a critical factor as long as vibrations exist. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,2015,Journal,Choe P.; Schumacher D.,10.1080/10447318.2014.959101

A case study evaluating the impact of human behavior on a manufacturing process in-line with automatic processes by means of a simulation model,"In many manufacturing systems human resources are essential in some cognitive intensive tasks while the more repetitive ones are assigned to automatic systems. If on the one hand, automation has a deterministic pace; humans are known by a flexible and variable work manner. Therefore, a reliable description of both hardware and human components is required for designing such manufacturing systems. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the variable throughput of a manual process in a production flow that contains automatic processes upstream and downstream. With regard to the description of human behavior, two sources of variability were considered: natural and abnormal variability. Natural variability refers to the differences in terms of processing times that can be found among individuals.

Performance of 3D computers and 3d printed models as a fundamental means for spatial engineering information visualization,"Engineering information delivery can be a source of inefficient communication of design, leading to construction rework and lower worker morale. Due to errors, omissions, and misinterpretations, there remains a great opportunity to improve the traditional documentation of engineering information that craft professionals use to complete their work. Historically, physical three dimensional (3D) models built by hand provided 3D physical representations of the project to assist in sequencing, visualization, and planning of critical construction activities. This practice has greatly diminished since the adoption of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) and building information modeling technologies. Recently, additive manufacturing (a.k.a. 3D printing) technologies have allowed for three dimensional printing of 3D CAD models. A cognitive experiment was established to measure the effectiveness of 2D drawings, a 3D computer model, and a 3D printed model in delivering engineering information to an end-user are scientifically measured. The 3D printed model outperformed the 2D drawings and 3D computer interface in productivity measures.

Learning Environment to Take Operational Decision in Emergency Situation,"In psychological and human factors engineering sciences have been strengthened research on the way in which social and demographic variables influence the cognitive functioning of the employee at the time of decision. It is understood that performing tasks at work seeks continuous satisfaction of demands for physical and material security, social and emotional comfort as well as economic and productive stability. Due to the complexity of living systems in the global community, involving increasing environmental changes and limit natural resources, intolerance and social violence, political and economic crises, the demand is presented by investigations of such dimensions on decision making, between designated professional to decide in emergency situations. In the high-risk process industry can happen emergency situations where the lives of many people depend on the decision of a few actors. Extrapolating limits of a model that is not only rational (manage) or emotional (preserve) or instinctual (flee, freeze or fight), the model indicated by the API 770 and discussed in this article indicates that there is an optimal range of stress level to maintain the effectiveness of the task. This paper proposes: a mental model to address emergencies that differs from the model used in the routine decision, and a method to assess technical and intuitive decision and the right profile of the teams for the actions in emergency situations. A case of the liquefied petroleum gas industry (LPG) was analyzed, which makes up a projection of behavior, learning environment, with the gradual increase of stress on the staff of operators and the effects on mental model for decision. © 2015 The Authors",Emergency; Learning environment.; Operational Decision,Procedia Manufacturing,2015,Conference,Filho S.Á.; Carvalho A.C.F.; Portela G.P.J.; Costa C.,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.460
Cognitive safety control for human-machine interaction,"In order to introduce cognition, i.e. perception and autonomously reconfigured control, into manufacturing systems for increasing the flexibility and adaptivity this paper proposes an architecture of a cognitive safety controller (CSC). The CSC consists of a strategic controller (SC) and an operational controller (OC): the SC iteratively computes (sub-)optimal control strategies taking dynamic models, safety specifications, and learned knowledge into account. The operational controller (OC) provides certified safety by safe realization of the strategy computed by the SC. The paper illustrates the application of the CSC to a cognitive manufacturing system (CMS) in which a robot and a human operator share a workspace. Important components of this application are a procedure to compute (sub)optimal strategies for varying control specifications online and a scheme for implementing the strategy on a programmable logic controller (PLC). © 2009 EUCA.",,"2009 European Control Conference, ECC 2009",2014,Conference,Ding H.; Kain S.; Schiller F.; Stursberg O.,10.23919/ecc.2009.7075196
A comprehensive optimization method for complex industrial processes,"Based on psychological experiments and psychophysical mechanisms, it is possible to acquire manufacturing workshop operator's behavior and cognitive situations. A comprehensive optimization model for complex industrial processes is proposed by integrating expert operator's behavior and electrophysiological characters.

Task Analysis and Ergonomic Evaluation in Camshaft Production Operations,"Here we report results of a study conducted at an industrial facility located in the central region of Mexico. It is devoted to the manufacturing of camshafts. We completed an ergonomic assessment on the working circumstances of a production line where workers interact with CNC lathes. Operating this machinery entails the performance of both physical and cognitive effort, circumstances that correspond to a process of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT). The study consisted of a visual inspection of the work areas, video recording both of the site and of the workers in action, analysis of the recordings, and assessment with the REBA method. The tasks performed by the workers consist of a) handling (loading and unloading to/from the lathe) the camshaft components, b) visual inspection and test of compliance to the required parameters, c) adjusting the machinery as required, d) setting the finished pieces in containers. The recorded material allowed identifying 35 separate operations which were then analysed with the REBA Method. The results were as follows: 3 operations classified as a Very High Risk Level, 14 classified as High Risk level, 14 classified as Medium Risk Level and 4 operations classified as Low Risk Level. The body regions most at risk for WRMSD were the trunk, neck, arm and wrist. A series of changes in the workstation layout and in work procedures have been proposed, in order to ameliorate the ergonomic risk found. © 2015 The Authors",AMT; Ergonomic risk evaluation; REBA Method; Task analyisis,Procedia Manufacturing,2015,Conference,Serratos-Perez J.N.; Hernandez-Arellano J.L.; Negrete-Garcia M.C.,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.407
Physical Activity as a Strategy for Prevention and Health Promotion in the Occupational Context: An Example of Corporate Engagement,"Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM) is a public utility company that provides electricity, natural gas, water supply, basic sanitation, waste management, information technology and communication services that meet the very highest international standards of quality. The company serves some 3.6 million residents in Medellín and the Valle de Aburrá Metropolitan Area, with its coverage extending to 125 municipalities in the region. Organized as a “state-owned, industrial and commercial enterprise”, EPM has established itself at the forefront of the sector. Since late 2012, the EPM Group has been remodeling itself “in line with a new strategic direction for the 10.583 family members who are beneficiaries of a set of services for health and safety within a framework of prevention and promotion as a strategy to improve quality of life.” Through human development and occupational risk and welfare, this example of EPM's business commitment is expressed in a series of actions and services for integral development, carried out through programs that focus on physical/recreational, intellectual, spiritual, social and cognitive components. Particularly significant is the physical activity program, created as a strategy model for health in the workplace. The program extends to the family group (beneficiaries), with an emphasis on how the benefits of sports and physical exercise can improve performance at work, as well as constituting a healthy lifestyle habit. A relationship between ergonomics and prevention is also established as a way to facilitate the creation of a culture of self-care. © 2015 The Authors",Corporate engagement; Ergonomics/human factors and prevention; Healthy lifestyle habit; Physical activity; Sport and recreation,Procedia Manufacturing,2015,Conference,Cadavid E.; Sáenz L.M.,10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.191
Activity analysis of expert and novice operators in a semi-automated manufacturing process,"Designing a human-machine interface for a manufacturing process requires a good knowledge of both the work domain and the operators' representation. Ecological Interface Design (EID) offers some interesting tools that can be of help in the design process. The literature on cognitive control also offers a good understanding of operators' cognitive resources. Analysing the activity of both expert and novice operators through these two frameworks may help us to better understand the differences between them. A three-step protocol was followed: 1. the elaboration of a means-end hierarchy, 2. the extraction of schemes via interviews, and 3. the evaluation of the behavioural manifestation of schemes. In the present case study, interviews revealed that both the novice and expert operators of a manufacturing process shared a representation of the global process. However, in contrast with the expert operators, the novice operators did not develop an operative scheme that related to the machine. The results will be used as a basis for the design of a human-machine interface that will aid them to do so.

Human error analysis: Review of past accidents and implications for improving robustness of system design,"Since the establishment of the high-technology industry and industrial systems, developments of new materials and fabrication techniques, associated with cutting-edge structural and engineering assessments, are contributing to more reliable and consistent systems, thus reducing the likelihood of losses. However, recent accidents are acknowledged to be linked to human factors which led to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, the understanding of human behavioural characteristics interlaced with the actual technology aspects and organisational context is of paramount importance for the safety & reliability field. This study first approaches this multidisciplinary problem by classifying and reviewing 200 major accident data from insurance companies and regulatory authorities under the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis framework. Then, specific attention is dedicated to discuss the implications for improving robustness of system design and tackling the surrounding factors and tendencies that could lead to the manifestation of human errors. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Safety and Reliability: Methodology and Applications - Proceedings of the European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2014",2015,Conference,Moura R.; Beer M.; Patelli E.; Lewis J.; Knoll F.,10.1201/b17399-147
Selecting Video Analytics using Cognitive Ergonomics: A Case Study for Operational Experimentation,"The objective of this research is to achieve innovation with a disruptive edge in a human-driven operational environment where layering key information is critical to the customer's current story-boarding solution space. However, new online video data sources present an increasing complexity, with visual cues trapped in hours of video data with no automated means to easily locate and extract key data nuggets. The solution is the introduction of disruptive concepts with an ‘operational experimentation’ focus to mimic the customer's approach. This new method will embrace the larger ‘tell me a story’ perceptive approach to automate the process of building a user defined text story representation based on the accurate discovery / identification of relevant content in the online videos. This paper will cover overall components of the operational experimentation methodology which is part of a long-term (12-24 month) software research and development (R&D) prototyping strategy to operationalize software through a customer driven partnership. This methodology borrows ideas from multiple disciplines including cognitive ergonomics, computer science and industrial engineering. This case study emphasizes the importance of incorporating how humans cognitively process film based stimulation as a ‘story’, to design a system that will assist humans by automating the processing of online social media based video streams and imagery. The significance of this work demonstrates a paradigm shift in how automated video analysis is designed and accomplished through sharing pros and cons of selecting and operationally testing analytics through a series of vignettes. Beginning with an on-line video and concluding with a text based story of that video that is now searchable, understandable, and available to traditional cloud based analytics tailored to an organization's particular needs.

Getting to grips with human factors in drilling Operations,"Since the events on Montara in late 2009 and Macondo in 2010, the exploration and production industry has undergone a substantial change in culture and regulation. However, investigations still tend to focus on technological and managerial deficiencies rather than probing deeper into the causes of human error. Nonetheless, facilitated by organisations such as International Oil and Gas Producers Association (OGP), there is a growing desire to understand human and organisational factors that influence potential process safety incidents during drilling and completion operations. A workshop was held in London in October 2014 to define and clarify the underlying ideas about human factors related to the drilling community. The objectives of the workshop were: • Introducing the concepts behind human factors and key definitions • Highlighting the effects of human factors in drilling operations • Operationalising human factors and the impact of the introduction of new technology • Implementing training and assessment of non-technical skills • Taking human factors into the mainstream of drilling operations Attendees at the workshop discussed the principles underlying the psychological concepts of human factors, such as non-technical skills, cognitive bias, weak signals and chronic unease, as well as socio-technical systems and the impact of automation. Examples of how the influences of human factors may be recognised in routine drilling operations and how biases affect decision-making were examined. Practical applications of human factors techniques were described, along with methods currently being implemented to train and assess non-technical skills. The workshop culminated in a debate about how to operationalise human factors in drilling operations. The main points to emerge from the presentations and ensuing discussions are summarised and references are provided for further reading. Practical tools and insights that can be applied in day-to-day operations are also presented. In conclusion, workshop presenters and attendees, whilst acknowledging the importance of human factors on drilling operations, also recognised the challenges yet to be overcome in implementing human factors principles in the workplace. However, there are some positive signs of growing acceptance and influences. By facilitating open dialogue about human factors in drilling the goal is to encourage progress towards human factors integration being the norm rather than the exception.

Developing a set of human factors barriers for deepwater drilling risk assessment,"Objectives/Scope: Human error and human factors are contributing causes in over 50 percent of well control incidents, according to SINTEF data. While straight-forward cognitive errors and wrong actions contribute to 15 percent of incidents, the larger span of human factors includes communication failures, workload, management practices, and information availability and presentation problems that lead to mistakes, such as imperfect kick detection or underbalanced wells. Yet human factors is often treated as an issue of human reliability estimates and the need to define better procedures that design human error out of the system. There are, however, many shortcomings to the focus on procedures and human reliability estimates, for example, variations among installations, situations that lie outside existing procedures and estimates, and analyses of rote procedure-following that exclude situation variability and expert problem solving. What is needed is a deeper, human factors-centric, approach that looks beneath the procedures for underlying systemic causes: operator situation awareness and decision making, team common ground and collaboration, and resilient socio-technical organizational processes. Our project is taking this human factors approach with a comprehensive analysis of well control during deepwater drilling. Methods, Procedures, Process: Our novel approach is to marry the risk management framework of threats and barriers with the human factors concept of the decision cycle. The decision cycle concept outlines the cognitive steps involved in decision making from detection, to interpretation, deciding, and acting. Our innovation is that these concepts can be brought together to identify a set of 117 ""human factors barriers"" for effective detection of an influx. These human factors barriers support team situation awareness, communication, and decision making. These barriers include the availability and representation of data, user vigilance, support for critical thinking, crew resource management, shift change hand-off processes, system status availability, and change management processes. These human factors barriers can be applied readily to other decisions within well control. Results, Observations, and Conclusions: We have created a database of BSEE/BOEM incident reports and reviewed these incidents against the human factors barriers. We have identified a number of ""hot spots"" or trends where specific human factors barriers were frequently compromised. These trends include sensor placement for situation awareness, shift hand-off processes and team communication, and decision support for critical thinking and diagnosis of uncertain situations. Novel/Additive Information: These human factors barriers and the identified trends can be used a) pre-incident to review and audit drilling rigs and well plans to identify and then avoid potential problems, b) post-incident to investigate and report on incidents from a human factors perspective and thereby better inform the industry concerning these topics, and c) to identify key topics for further research and development of improved systems and processes.

"Design, programming and orchestration of heterogeneous manufacturing systems through VR-powered remote collaboration","Modern manufacturing systems are often composed of a variety of highly customized units and specifically designed manufacturing cells. Optimization of assembly and training of staff requires a series of demo installations and excessive use of costly operational resources. In some cases, components are located at different sites, making the orchestration of the whole system even more difficult. Virtual Reality (VR) collaboration environments offer a solution by enabling high fidelity testing and training of complex manufacturing systems. On the other hand, such platforms are difficult to implement in an engineering perspective, as they are required to provide reliable, standard interfaces towards both robotic components and human operators. The VirCA (Virtual Collaboration Arena) platform is a software framework that supports various means of collaboration through the use of 3D augmented/virtual reality as a communication medium. VirCA offers functions for the high-level interoperability of heterogeneous components in a wide range of domains, spanning from research & development, through remote education to orchestration and management of industrial processes in manufacturing applications. This paper provides an overview of the industrial requirements behind high-fidelity virtual collaboration and demonstrates how the VirCA platform meets these requirements. Use cases are provided to illustrate the usability of the platform. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Mill setup manual aided by augmented reality,"As a result of globalization, the degree of complexity in manufacturing systems and the existence of very elaborate processes are increasing. At the same time there is a contradiction, while high quality is demanded to the operators, reduction in setup and operation time is also required. It is crucial to deploy a particular interest in matters of efficiency that drives us to incorporate emerging technologies in these processes. One of them, The Augmented Reality (AR), is known as the combination of virtual and real images without completely replacing the real environment which is interactive and registered in 3D.

Prioritization of factors impacting on performance of power looms using AHP,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical success factors influencing the performance of power loom textiles, to evaluate their impact on the organizational performance and to find out the effect of these factors on the organizational performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Solapur (Maharashtra) industrial sector using AHP. In the methodology adopted, factors are identified through the literature survey and finalization of these factors is done by taking the opinion of experts in the Indian context. By cognitive map, the relation between these factors (direct and indirect effect) is determined and cause and effect diagram is prepared. Then these factors are arranged hierarchically and tree diagram is prepared. A questionnaire was designed and distributed among the experts; data is collected. Using expert choice software data is filled to quantify by pair-wise comparison of these factors and are prioritized. The weights demonstrate several key findings: local and global priority reveals that there is a substantial effect of the human resource, product style, and volume on the organizational performance. The skills and technology upgradation impact on organizational performance. Maintenance plays an important role in improving the organizational performances of the SMEs. Overall, the results showed the central role of the operational factors are important. The research is subject to the normal limitations of AHP. The study is using perceptual data provided by Experts which may not provide clear measures of impact factors. However, this can be overcome using more experts to collect data in future studies. Interestingly, the findings here may be generalisable outside Solapur like Ichalkarnji, Malegaon, and Bhiwadi (Maharashtra). Solapur power loom SMEs should consider AHP as an innovative tool for quantification of factors impacting on performance and improving operational and organizational performance in today’s dynamic manufacturing environment. The finding suggests the notion that these critical success factors (CSFs) are to be studied carefully and improvement strategy should be developed. Moreover, the study emphasizes the need to link priority of factors to organizational performance and improvement. The study integrates the CSFs of performance and its quantification using AHP and its effect on performance of power loom textiles. The indirect impacts of underlying and fundamental factors are considered. Very few studies have been performed to investigate and understand this issue. Therefore, the research can make a useful contribution. © 2014, The Author(s).",AHP; Experts from the field; Factors and subfactors; Power looms; Prioritization,Journal of Industrial Engineering International,2014,Journal,Dulange S.R.; Pundir A.K.; Ganapathy L.,10.1007/s40092-014-0080-8
The development of a novel complex medication adherence and monitoring technology,"Purpose: The State of Ohio has initiated a number of programs to support collaborations between Ohio universities and Ohio companies. Under the umbrella of the Ohio Third Frontier Program (OTF)1, block grants have been made to institutions to support incubators and other similar services, as well as focused loan and grant programs administered by the OTF itself. One such program is the Technology Validation and Start-up program. This program requires University-developed technologies to be validated in collaboration with an industry partner and operates in two phases. The first phase is for feasibility testing and the second phase is to support demonstration and commercialization. iRxReminder LLC, an Ohiobased start-up, developed a smartphone-based data gathering system consisting of a cloudbased control center and an app. The iRxReminder app supports complex medication schedules, is customizable to track symptoms, and can present patient education podcasts. Kent State University utilized the system for a study of heart failure patients. During the study, limitations in confirmation of medication dispensing were found to obscure the results of the study. Jointly, a medication dispensing and tracking system was designed that would interoperate with the iRxReminder system. A Phase I application for the Technology Validation and Start-up program was filed with OTF and awarded. Subsequently, a joint patent was filed, a prototype was completed, and a human factors test was conducted. Method: Structured interviews were conducted with 16 heart failure patients selected from a pool of hospital patients who indicated that they would participate in the research. The participants varied in age from 54 to 87 years with an average age of 68 years. Participants reported taking between 4 and 36 medications and supplements per day with an average of 12 medications. Results: The iLidRx system was explained to the participants, and then participants were asked about specific aspects and how useful these would be to the participants in supporting their medication regimen. Participants rated on a seven-point scale that the system and the use of a green LED on the top of the pod were very clear in indicating what medications to take and when to take them (6.5 out of 7.0). The participants also indicated that the alerts on the smartphone were very useful (6.5 out of 7.0), and those participants who were interested in monitoring (25%) indicated that this was very useful as well (6.7 out of 7.0). Following the success of Phase I, a Phase II project was designed to apply the complete system, control center, app, and medication dispensing system, called the iLidRx (Figure 1), to aid the recovery of patients following hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy, commonly known as bone marrow transplant. Another OTF-supported entity, the Great Lakes Innovation Development Enterprise Innovation Fund, has awarded a grant to support a pilot (http://www.innovationfundneohio.com).

Transplantation of human fetal-derived neural stem cells improves cognitive function following cranial irradiation,"Treatment of central nervous system (CNS) malignancies typically involves radiotherapy to forestall tumor growth and recurrence following surgical resection. Despite the many benefits of cranial radiotherapy, survivors often suffer from a wide range of debilitating and progressive cognitive deficits. Thus, while patients afflicted with primary and secondary malignancies of the CNS now experience longer local regional control and progressionfree survival, there remains no clinical recourse for the unintended neurocognitive sequelae associated with their cancer treatments. Multiple mechanisms contribute to disrupted cognition following irradiation, including the depletion of radiosensitive populations of stem and progenitor cells in the hippocampus. We have explored the potential of using intrahippocampal transplantation of human stem cells to ameliorate radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. Past studies demonstrated the capability of cranially transplanted human embryonic (hESCs) and neural (hNSCs) stem cells to functionally restore cognition in rats 1 and 4 months after cranial irradiation. The present study employed an FDA-approved fetal-derived hNSC line capable of large scale-up under good manufacturing practice (GMP). Animals receiving cranial transplantation of these cells 1 month following irradiation showed improved hippocampal spatial memory and contextual fear conditioning performance compared to irradiated, sham surgery controls. Significant newly born (doublecortin positive) neurons and a smaller fraction of glial subtypes were observed within and nearby the transplantation core. Engrafted cells migrated and differentiated into neuronal and glial subtypes throughout the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the host hippocampus. These studies expand our prior findings to demonstrate that transplantation of fetal-derived hNSCs improves cognitive deficits in irradiated animals, as assessed by two separate cognitive tasks. © 2014 Cognizant Comm.

The development and testing of SAfER: A resilience-based human factors method,"Major industrial accidents still occur. Recent research suggests that to improve industrial safety we must design work systems that better support operators as they seek to control unexpected and unprecedented situations. A novel human factors technique called SAfER - Strategies Analysis for Enhancing Resilience - has been developed to help practitioners identify the range of strategies that human operators might use to manage expected, unexpected, and unprecedented situations. SAfER also helps practitioners identify design changes that should promote the selection of successful control strategies, as well as design changes that should prevent or tolerate the selection of any potential unsuccessful control strategies. Tests revealed that participants found SAfER to be a useful method capable of helping them identify novel insights and identify design changes that could help operators as they control systems across different operating situations. In future work, the usability of the SAfER method and software will be improved, and they will be tested in further industrial contexts. © 2014, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",accident analysis; cognitive work analysis; design evaluation; resilience engineering; risk management; strategies analysis,Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making,2014,Journal,Hassall M.E.; Sanderson P.M.; Cameron I.T.,10.1177/1555343414527287
Effects of cold environments on human reliability assessment in offshore oil and gas facilities,"Objective: This paper proposes a new methodology that focuses on the effects of cold and harsh environments on the reliability of human performance. Background: As maritime operations move into Arctic and Antarctic environments, decision makers must be able to recognize how cold weather affects human performance and subsequently adjusts management and operational tools and strategies. Method: In the present work, a revised version of the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) methodology has been developed to assess the effects of cold on the likelihood of human error in offshore oil and gas facilities. This methodology has been applied to post-maintenance tasks of offshore oil and gas facility pumps to investigate how management, operational, and equipment issues must be considered in risk analysis and prediction of human error in cold environments. Results: This paper provides a proof of concept indicating that the risk associated with operations in cold environments is greater than the risk associated with the same operations performed in temperate climates. It also develops guidelines regarding how this risk can be assessed. The results illustrate that in post-maintenance procedures of a pump, the risk value related to the effect of cold and harsh environments on operator cognitive performance is twice as high as the risk value when performed in normal conditions. Conclusion: The present work demonstrates significant differences between human error probabilities (HEPs) and associated risks in normal conditions as opposed to cold and harsh environments. This study also highlights that the cognitive performance of the human operator is the most important factor affected by the cold and harsh conditions. Application: The methodology developed in this paper can be used for reevaluating the HEPs for particular scenarios that occur in harsh environments since these HEPs may not be comparable to similar scenarios in normal conditions.

Design of multi-modal feedback channel of human-robot cognitive interface for teleoperation in manufacturing,"Teleoperation, which is a specific mode of human-robot collaboration enabling a human operator to provide instructions and monitor the actions of the robot remotely, has proved beneficial for application to hazardous and unstructured manufacturing environments. Despite the design of a command channel from human operators to robots, most existing studies on teleoperation fail to focus on the design of the feedback channel from the robot to the human operator, which plays a crucial role in reducing the cognitive load, particularly in precise and concentrated manufacturing tasks. This paper focuses on designing a feedback channel for the cognitive interface between a human operator and a robot considering human cognition. Current studies on human-robot cognitive interfaces in robot teleoperation are extensively surveyed. Further, the modalities of human cognition that foster understanding and transparency during teleoperation are identified. In addition, the human-robot cognitive interface, which utilizes the proposed multi-modal feedback channel, is developed on a teleoperated robotic grasping system as a case study. Finally, a series of experiments based on different modal feedback channels are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing the performance of the teleoperated grasping of fragile products and reducing the cognitive load via the objective aspects of experimental results and the subjective aspects of operator feedback.",Robot teleoperation; Human-robot collaboration; Multi-modal feedback channel; Human-robot cognitive interface; Cognitive load,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING,2024,Journal,"Zheng, C; Wang, KN; Gao, SQ; Yu, Y; Wang, ZX; Tang, YL",10.1007/s10845-024-02451-x

Cyber-Physical Operator Assistance Systems in Industry: Cross-Hierarchical Perspectives on Augmenting Human Abilities,"In production systems, manual tasks need to be considered more than the sum of repetitive sub-tasks which can simply be taken over by autonomous systems. Despite technological advances in automation, the presence of human operators remains essential on future shop floors. Consequently, it is of interest for manufacturing organizations how cyber-physical operator assistance systems (C.O.A.S.) can augment skills of operators on the shop floor. However, there is a limited understanding of how relevant stakeholders in manufacturing organizations assess the suitability of COAS. This is crucial in so far as the adoption of COAS significantly depends on the approval of stakeholders throughout the respective manufacturing organization. This paper explores how stakeholders in manufacturing organizations assess the role of COAS on future shop floors. This is realized by conducting an exploratory, multi-method, qualitative study encompassing interviews of executives, instructors, and operators. Additionally, the study incorporates ethnographic observations in industrial education. A result of the study is that informants expect COAS to be promising for manufacturing organizations if systems augment cognitive abilities of operators, rather than their physical abilities.",Industry 4.0; cyber-physical production system; human-computer interaction; human-centric production; operator assistance systems; worker support,2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT (IEEE IEEM),2020,Conference,"Moencks, M; Roth, E; Bohne, T",10.1109/ieem45057.2020.9309734
Immersive Systems in Human-Centered Manufacturing: The Informational Dimension,"The rise of smart manufacturing environments, characterized by high quantity of data/information available, contributes to a growing interest and research towards the use of immersive technologies not only in factories but also across entire value chains. New immersive technologies and devices are being developed to improve cooperation within Collaborative Networks (CNs), especially in the human-machine hybrid networks context. The application of these technologies in such complex environments expands substantially the modes how information is delivered and used, which may exacerbate one of the oldest problems of cognitive ergonomics: information overload. Therefore, this work presents applications of immersive technologies in manufacturing into the perspective of information work and immersive human-centered manufacturing systems. A framework is proposed to be developed in a FabLab to understand the worker needs and interactions. This FabLab aims to demonstrate the potential/real application of immersive technologies, towards the enhancement of the human worker cognitive capabilities.",Mixed reality; Augmented reality; Virtual reality; Industry 4.0; Human-worker; Human-centered manufacturing; Information management,"BOOSTING COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS 4.0: 21ST IFIP WG 5.5 WORKING CONFERENCE ON VIRTUAL ENTERPRISES, PRO-VE 2020",2021,Conference,"Ramalho, FR; Soares, AL; Almeida, AH",10.1007/978-3-030-62412-5_25
Supporting cognitive intelligence for smart manufacturing systems using HMI design: challenges and fundamental issues,"As the rate of digitalisation grows in the manufacturing sector, there is a need to address the manner in which design for the human experience is conceptualised. In industrial systems, user experience/user interface (UX/UI) as a paradigm does not fit in squarely, as industrial technologies require a blend of humans and technology for productivity. Thus, the aim of this article is to highlight the challenges and fundamental issues related to human-machine interaction (HMI) design in smart manufacturing from the disciplines of Human Factors and Interaction Design in terms of major themes: (1) designing for operator experience, (2) meaning-based analytics and design for complexity, and (3) human-centered design process for enabling reliability, maintainability, availability, and safety. These various challenges are depicted using a case study of HMI concept design for monitoring an additive manufacturing setup. The article concludes by discussing future steps for addressing HMI design in the manufacturing sector.",Human machine interaction; industry 4.0; operator 4.0; human centered design; additive manufacturing,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,2024,Journal,"Kant, V; Nejeeb, I; Alya, S; Jain, P; Singh, R",10.1080/09544828.2024.2343746
Cognitive Human Modeling in Collaborative Robotics,"In today's INDUSTRY 4.0 context, the growing need to improve performances and sustainability of working environment is looking forward to developing interoperable and service-oriented systems with real time capabilities. This is boosting the installation of decentralized and reliable robotics cells with flexible cooperative capabilities. They enroll smart operators' flexibility and robot productivity in collaborative robotics (properly cobots) applications. This paper consists of a state-of-the-art review on cognitive load in manufacturing with characterization of humanrobot collaboration. A simulated analysis of a collaborative working cell is performed. An Agent Based (AB) model is presented with application in the automotive sector. The cell consists of logistics AGVs equipped with a manipulator. They interact with working robots and human operator. Robots collaborate in cell and they cooperate with operator on assisted task using Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). The load of human in the collaborative work-cell- set on state of art - is measured according with Functional states over different Behavioral Structures (FBS). We quantified the load of cognitive factors while reporting interaction analysis. Some factors as age and interface complexity and recovery strategy are investigated while reporting their effect on a dynamic variable, i.e., physical stress properly fatigue. This acts on productivity and operational outcomes. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The paper investigates and analyzes what happens in the transition phase when resuming to the primary task; to understand what kind of support assembly workers may need during this critical and cognitively demanding phase-so that the interval between the interrupted and the primary tasks can be shortened to increase efficiency, during mediated interruptions. Subjects were interrupted during primary assembly tasks via a mobile device which delivered various notifications. We focused on the selected cognitive strategies applied when decreasing the subjects' experienced cognitive load as they resumed to their primary task.

Electroencephalogram based Biomarkers for Tracking the Cognitive Workload of Operators in Process Industries,"Human errors are a root cause of majority of accidents occurring in the process industry. These errors are often a result of excessive workload on operators, especially during abnormal situations. Understanding and measurement of cognitive workload (overload), experienced by human operators while performing key safety critical tasks, is thus important to the understanding of human errors. Subjective measurements of workload are often not reliable and there is a need for physiological based parameters of workload. In this work, we propose a methodology to measure cognitive load of a control room operator in terms of a biomarker, specifically theta/alpha ratio, obtained from a single electrode EEG signal. Real-time detection of the biomarker can enable minimize errors and improve safety.",EEG; human errors; cognitive workload; safety,"29TH EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING, PT B",2019,Conference,"Iqbal, MU; Srinivasan, B; Srinivasan, R",10.1016/B978-0-12-818634-3.50233-2
Does cognitive aspects of information and material presentation matter in worker allocation in an assembly line? A case study of a recycling unit in India,"In most manufacturing units, the contribution of human labor remains a vital element that affects overall performance and output. The research explicated in this paper is conducted in a pen recycling unit in the southern part of India which is an initiative by a non-profit organization to reduce plastic waste and highlight the need for recycling. The objectives of the study are two-fold. Firstly, to investigate the influence of cognitive aspects namely information and material presentation on worker performance in an assembly line and secondly to propose an economical worker allocation approach based on the findings of the first study considering the pen recycling unit. An experimental study was conducted with fifteen workers and was given eight different scenarios with the combinations of presenting material and information with six pen varieties for assembly. The performance of workers is identified and appropriate allocations are made to suitable workstations. Further, a subjective measurement using NASA-TLX is also done to determine the mental workload of workers. The results indicate that individual worker performance varies significantly, much more than is assumed. This variation is due to the difference in cognitive capabilities among workers when they are introduced to different product variants and work environments. It is expected that the proposed economical allocation method will be beneficial for similar micro, small and medium enterprises that contribute in achieving sustainability goals.",Cognitive aspects; worker allocation; human performance measurement; manual assembly; sustainability,SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES,2023,Journal,"Giridhar, MP; Panicker, VV",10.1007/s12046-023-02078-3
"Improving Welding Robotization via Operator Skill Identification, Modeling, and Human-Machine Collaboration: Experimental Protocol Implementation","The industry of the future, also known as Industry 5.0, aims to modernize production tools, digitize workshops, and cultivate the invaluable human capital within the company. Industry 5.0 can't be done without fostering a workforce that is not only technologically adept but also has enhanced skills and knowledge. Specifically, collaborative robotics plays a key role in automating strenuous or repetitive tasks, enabling human cognitive functions to contribute to quality and innovation. In manual manufacturing, however, some of these tasks remain challenging to automate without sacrificing quality. In certain situations, these tasks require operators to dynamically organize their mental, perceptual, and gestural activities. In other words, skills that are not yet adequately explained and digitally modeled to allow a machine in an industrial context to reproduce them, even in an approximate manner. Some tasks in welding serve as a perfect example. Drawing from the knowledge of cognitive and developmental psychology, professional didactics, and collaborative robotics research, our work aims to find a way to digitally model manual manufacturing skills to enhance the automation of tasks that are still challenging to robotize. Using welding as an example, we seek to develop, test, and deploy a methodology transferable to other domains. The purpose of this article is to present the experimental setup used to achieve these objectives.",Skills; Scheme; Cognition; Welding; Robotics,"DIGITAL HUMAN MODELING AND APPLICATIONS IN HEALTH, SAFETY, ERGONOMICS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, PT I, DHM 2024",2024,Conference,"Lenat, A; Cheminat, O; Chablat, D; Charron, C",10.1007/978-3-031-61060-8_6
Spatial Augmented Reality in the Factory: Can In-Situ Projections Be Used to Communicate Dangers and Health Risks?,"In the context of industrial settings, extensive research of in-situ projections has proven their benefits for task performance. However, to date, these projections have not explicitly addressed policies designed to mitigate the dangers and health risks that are just as important, if not more than task performance considerations in such settings. We developed in-situ projections for three different use cases: (1) assembly support at a workbench, (2) ergonomic lifting, (3) restricted areas, which we studied with 15 representative target users. We found the expected benefits of the task-supporting projection (use case 1), increasing task performance and causing minimal cognitive load. However, our data also suggest that the other projections (use case 2 and 3) did not improve policy compliance. Our findings indicate that in-situ projections are not the most suitable solution to nudge workers to policy compliance in an industrial assembly setting, as most participants ignored the policy after evaluating the dangers themselves. Furthermore, based on our limitations and findings, we reflect on how current study practices can be improved for ubiquitous systems, especially when aiding policy compliance.",Spatial Augmented Reality; Pose Estimation; Human Machine Interaction; Learnability; Cognitive Load; Ergonomic Notifications; Collaborative Robot Safety Zone Awareness; Manual Assembly Assistance; Industrial Assembly,"HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION - INTERACT 2023, PT II",2023,Conference,"Wedral, A; Vrecar, R; Ebenhofer, G; Pönitz, T; Würer, PH; Weiss, A; Stübl, G",10.1007/978-3-031-42283-6_31
Design of Virtual Reality for Humanoid Robots with Inspiration from Video Games,"Advances in robotics have led to breakthroughs in several areas, including the development of humanoid robots. There are now several different models of humanoid robots available, but operating them remains a difficult challenge. Current operator control interfaces for humanoid robots often require very experienced operators and significant amounts of time for planning. A large amount of the planning and cognitive load is attributable to the operator attempting to gain adequate three-dimensional (3D) situation awareness and task awareness while viewing an interface on a flat, two-dimensional (2D) screen. Virtual reality (VR) has enormous potential to provide benefits to allow the operator to quickly and accurately understand the state of a robot in a scanned 3D environment and to issue accurate commands with less cognitive load. In the gaming sphere, VR headsets remain a new and promising interface for playing video games. In some cases, existing video games are being ported over to VR and, in others, brand new games are being designed with VR in mind. Control schemes and best practices for VR are emerging within the video game industry.

In this context, new types of interactions between operators and machines are facilitated, that can be realized through artificial intelligence (AI) based and voice-enabled Digital Intelligent Assistants (DIA). Apart from the existing technological challenges, this direction requires new methodologies for the evaluation of such technological solutions that will be able to treat AI in manufacturing as a socio-technical system.

Cognitive Cyber-Physical Production Systems: A New Concept of Manufacturing Systems on the Route to Industry 5.0,"The European Commission has announced a new production philosophy for a sustainable, human-centric and resilient European industry. It has recently emerged under the name Industry 5.0 and opens up new perspectives for the development of advanced manufacturing systems. The concept of Industry 5.0 brings forth a new paradigm in the field of manufacturing systems, the so-called adaptive cognitive manufacturing systems (ACMS) paradigm. A fundamental building block of ACMS is the new generation of manufacturing systems called cognitive cyber- physical production systems (C-CPPS). This paper presents the development of a new production system. Its development stems from earlier work on a generic conceptual model of a cyber-physical production system (CPPS). The conceptual model of the C-CPPS incorporates the key technologies of Industry 4.0 for the development, adaptation and implementation of a CPPS and the advanced cognitive technologies of Industry 5.0 for the symbiosis of humans and automation.",cognitive cyber-physical production systems; enabling technologies; human-centric; industry 5.0; resilient; sustainable,"NEW TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION VI, VOL 1",2023,Conference,"Hozdic, E; Jurkovic, Z",10.1007/978-3-031-31066-9_21
The Repercussions of Business Process Modeling Notations on Mental Load and Mental Effort,"Over the last decade, plenty business process modeling notations emerged for the documentation of business processes in enterprises. During the learning of a modeling notation, an individual is confronted with a cognitive load that has an impact on the comprehension of a notation with its underlying formalisms and concepts. To address the cognitive load, this paper presents the results from an exploratory study, in which a sample of 94 participants, divided into novices, intermediates, and experts, needed to assess process models expressed in terms of eight different process modeling notations, i.e., BPMN 2.0, Declarative Process Modeling, eGantt Charts, EPCs, Flow Charts, IDEF3, Petri Nets, and UML Activity Diagrams. The study focus was set on the subjective comprehensibility and accessibility of process models reflecting participant's cognitive load (i.e., mental load and mental effort). Based on the cognitive load, a factor reflecting the mental difficulty for comprehending process models in different modeling notations was derived. The results indicate that established modeling notations from industry (e.g., BPMN) should be the first choice for enterprises when striving for process management. Moreover, study insights may be used to determine which modeling notations should be taught for an introduction in processmodeling or which notation is useful to teach and train process modelers or analysts.",Business process modeling notations; Cognitive load; Mental load; Mental effort; Human-centered design,"BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT WORKSHOPS, BPM 2018 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOPS",2019,Conference,"Zimoch, M; Pryss, R; Probst, T; Schlee, W; Reichert, M",10.1007/978-3-030-11641-5_11
Cognitive Exoskeletons: Harnessing AI for Enhanced Wearable Robotics in Shipbuilding,"In recent years, manufacturing has been undergoing major changes in search of more flexible and intelligent solutions, powered by Industry 4.0. While automation is what drove previous progress in industry, not every process can be automated, therefore, there is still a need for humans to carry out more complex tasks. Thus, in order to increase productivity and efficiency, while maintaining flexibility, robots can assist operators in their tasks rather than replace them. This paper proposes techniques for achieving seamless Human - Robot Collaboration (HRC), with wearable robots equipped with cognitive abilities that make them aware of their environments and the tasks the operator is performing. The main focus is on semi-active exoskeletons with adjustable torque and how they can be made autonomous. Their awareness is powered by computer vision techniques, mainly using anRGB-Dcamera and can automatically adjust the level of assistance they provide to the operator based on what they perceive, rather than having the operator control them directly. Consequently, they do not only improve the workload of the operator, but this assistance is offered without requiring specific actions from the user. This solution mainly focuses on the shipbuilding industry and the various tasks the workers have to perform in which exoskeletons can aid them. Finally, a welding use case is presented demonstrating the various functionalities.",Machine vision; Human action perception; Gesture recognition; Wearable robotics; Exoskeletons,"ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MANUFACTURING, ESAIM 2023",2024,Conference,"Kanakis, A; Katsampiris-Salgado, K; Zacharaki, N; Dimitropoulos, N; Makris, S",10.1007/978-3-031-57496-2_13
A theoretical framework for evaluating mental workload resources in human systems design for manufacturing operations,"As the nature of manufacturing work is changing, requiring more cognitive demands, there is a need to develop system models for measuring and predicting human performance in repetitive task operations. This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATE, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry: This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"A Comprehensive Study of Human Factors, Sensory Principles, and Commercial Solutions for Future Human-Centered Working Operations in Industry 5.0","The purpose of this study is to explore the measurement of human factors in the workplace that can provide critical insights into workers' well-being. Human factors refer to physical, cognitive, and psychological states that can impact the efficiency, effectiveness, and mental health of workers. The article identifies six human factors that are particularly crucial in today's workplaces: physical fatigue, attention, mental workload, stress, trust, and emotional state. Each of these factors alters the human physiological response in a unique way, affecting the human brain, cardiovascular, electrodermal, muscular, respiratory, and ocular reactions. This paper provides an overview of these human factors and their specific influence on psycho-physiological responses, along with suitable technologies to measure them in working environments and the currently available commercial solutions to do so.

Virtual Reality: A Possibility for Training Operator 4.0,"At technological advancements have led to the onset of industry 4.0, there must be a shift in the organizational frameworks, wherein manufacturing propensities and the traditional workplaces must transform to adopt a system wherein humans and machines can work together towards a rise in productivity and flexibility. These recent developments call for an up-gradation of the traditional operator to Operator 4.0 or Smart Operator as there has been a rise in a typical, unique work relationships which will require interactions between the operators and machines. These are challenging circumstances for engineers and operators as they must enhance their skills and abilities to keep up with the changing trend. Smart operators will also need to update their cognitive skills parallel with the innovations in the field of virtual reality and wearable technology equipment, as the equipment's augment the abilities of the Operator 4.0. This article aims to (1) Highlight the cognitive ergonomics skills required by operator 4.0 for Virtual Reality VR applications (2) Demonstrate how VR can be used to train future operator 4.0 to do his future tasks (3) Suggest how VR application in manufacturing can be improved for operator 4.0. The methodology in this research involves the usage of Virtual Reality to simulate a factory setup emulating Industry 4.0 factory. Based on the feedback of the participants, the efficiency of VR in training workers in the manufacturing industry can be determined.

Investigating the impact of cognitive assistive technologies on human performance and well-being: an experimental study in assembly and picking tasks,"Current industrial scenarios are characterised by increasingly demanding activities, especially order picking and assembly tasks. These activities require high levels of adaptability and manual dexterity, requirements that workers can fulfil, thus underscoring their paramount role. However, these tasks are becoming more complex and subjecting workers to greater cognitive strain. In this context, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies that provide cognitive support (cognitive assistive technologies) are essential for reducing cognitive load, facilitating decision-making, improving performance and safeguarding workers' well-being. This study investigates the effectiveness of cognitive assistive technologies through laboratory experiments with 37 participants performing assembly and order picking tasks. Performance and well-being outcomes are evaluated based on task completion time and perceived workload. Results suggest that among the technologies investigated, pick-by-light is the most effective in assisting users, easing decision-making, and ensuring performance and well-being. This study contributes to explorative works that focus on the human-centric outcomes of assistive technologies, examining their effectiveness in providing cognitive support.

Modeling workers' behavior: A human factors taxonomy and a fuzzy analysis in the case of industrial accidents,"While 'Industry 4.0' drives for greater automation, human factors are still essential in certain domains, especially in industrial disaster management. Despite human factors are frequently cause of individual biases and errors, a systematic quantitative analysis of the correlation between them and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial disaster has never been conducted. The aim of the present study is twofold: to design an original human factors taxonomy, which encompasses all the industrial worker's cognitive capabilities, physical skills, and psychological attitudes; to establish a correlation between each factor and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial emergency. A Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) analysis has been conducted in collaboration with 44 subject matter experts by using an ad-hoc developed tool to investigate, in particular, two types of workers, the role of emergency manager and the emergency team member. Results reveal that the factors have not the same weight in determining the human response performance: cognitive and psychological aspects have a substantial influence on the emergency manager's response performance, while the emergency team member's response performance is more influenced by psychological and physical aspects. Relevance to industry: Given the crucial role of cognitive, physical and psychological factors in modem human centred industrial systems and especially in the field of industrial safety & security, this study represents a meticulous guide for safety specialists in the design of disaster management strategies, for recruiters and practitioners in the development of competency-based job descriptions and for new research works for the development of personality-gifted intelligent agents in industrial applications.",Industrial accidents; Safety management; Human behaviour modeling; Human factors; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS,2019,Journal,"Longo, F; Nicoletti, L; Padovano, A",10.1016/j.ergon.2018.09.002
Vision-Based Hand Gesture Recognition for Human-Robot Collaboration: A Survey,"Recently, human-robot collaboration has attracted many research interests. Unlike traditional industrial robots, human-robot collaboration combines the advantages of robots with the flexibility and cognitive skills of human worker to work together in a shared manufacturing environment. However, to achieve an efficient human-robot collaboration, the communication channels between human workers and robots needs to be tackled. Vision-based hand gesture recognition has been effectively applied as the interface between humans and computer for long time. So, this paper presents a survey of the vision-based hand gesture recognition research in human-robot collaborative manufacturing. We first propose an overall model of vision-based hand gesture recognition for human-robot collaboration. Then, we review three essential technical components of this model: sensor technologies, hand gesture detection and segmentation and hand gesture classification. In addition, the relevant techniques for vision-based hand gesture recognition are compared.

Singularity-Robust Inverse Kinematics Solver for Tele-manipulation,"This paper investigates the effect of inverse kinematics (IK) on operator performance during the telemanipulation of an industrial robot. Robotic teleoperation is often preferred when manipulating objects in extreme conditions. In many applications, e.g., hazardous and high-consequence environments, operators cannot directly perceive the robot motions and have to rely only on CCTV views of the scene for situational awareness while teleoperating the heavy-duty industrial robots. Making best guesses for the IK plays a significant role on the task success rate and increases the operator cognitive load significantly. In this context, we develop a new optimisation-based IK solver that is robust with respect to the robot's singularities and assists the operator in generating smooth trajectories. Inspired by a successful algorithm used in computer graphics to solve the IK problem and devise smooth movements (FABRIK), our algorithm takes advantage also of the kinematic structure of the robot in order to decouple the notoriously difficult IK problem of orientation and position. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have compared its performance to that of the commonly used Jacobian pseudo inverse-based method in terms of positional accuracy and task-space reachability. We also report the results of telemanipulation experiments with human test-subjects. Our proposed IK algorithm outperforms classical IK methods on both objective metrics of task success, and subjective metrics of operator preference.",,2019 IEEE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (CASE),2019,Conference,"Ortenzi, V; Marturi, N; Rajasekaran, V; Adjigble, M; Stolkin, R",10.1109/coase.2019.8842871
"Practice With Less AI Makes Perfect: Partially Automated AI During Training Leads to Better Worker Motivation, Engagement, and Skill Acquisition","The increased prevalence of human-AI collaboration is reshaping the manufacturing sector, fundamentally changing the nature of human work and training needs. While high automation improves performance when functioning correctly, it can lead to problematic human performance (e.g., defect detection accuracy, response time) when operators are required to intervene and assume manual control of decision-making responsibilities. As AI capability reaches higher levels of automation and human-AI collaboration becomes ubiquitous, addressing these performance issues is crucial. Proper worker training, focusing on skill-based, cognitive, and affective outcomes, and nurturing motivation and engagement, can be a mitigation strategy. However, most training research in manufacturing has prioritized the effectiveness of a technology for training, rather than how training design influences motivation and engagement, key to training success and longevity. The current study explored how training workers using an AI system affected their motivation, engagement, and skill acquisition. Specifically, we manipulated the level of automation of decision selection of an AI used for the training of 102 participants for a quality control task. Findings indicated that fully automated decision selection negatively impacted perceived autonomy, self-determined motivation, behavioral task engagement, and skill acquisition during training. Conversely, partially automated AI-enhanced motivation and engagement, enabling participants to better adapt to AI failure by developing necessary skills. The results suggest that involving workers in decision-making during training, using AI as a decision aid rather than a decision selector, yields more positive outcomes. This approach ensures that the human aspect of manufacturing work is not overlooked, maintaining a balance between technological advancement and human skill development, motivation, and engagement. These findings can be applied to enhance real-world manufacturing practices by designing training programs that better develop operators' technical, methodological, and personal skills, though companies may face challenges in allocating substantial resources for training redevelopment and continuously adapting these programs to keep pace with evolving technology.",Human-centered AI; training curriculum; motivation; self-determination theory; industry 5.0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION,2024,Journal,"Passalacqua, M; Pellerin, R; Yahia, E; Magnani, F; Rosin, F; Joblot, L; Leger, PM",10.1080/10447318.2024.2319914
A Model to Estimate Operators' Performance in Accomplishing Assembly Tasks,"In the fourth industrial revolution, the digital network is the basis of smart manufacturing systems. In work environments 4.0, the operators' role is drastically changed. There is increasing utilisation of innovative devices, and new technologies have changed work activities into more cognitive than physical tasks. According to scientific studies in the new industrial era, the operators' skill to process the information related to a single task plays a crucial role in improving the manufacturing systems' effectiveness. The methods available in scientific literature to assess the operator's performance are mainly focused on the cognitive and physical efforts required by the task. In other words, they depend on tasks complexity and neglect human behaviour over time and the workers' abilities. Therefore, an evaluation including the skills and properness of a specific operator to perform an assigned task needs more investigation. Consistent with this research gap, the paper aims to develop an information-based theoretical model allowing to estimate an operator's performance index to accomplish an assembly job by evaluating both the tasks' complexity and the operator's skill. The model is applied to an automotive company to test and evaluate the potential applications of the methodology that go beyond the case study developed. The results proved the effectiveness of the model in estimating the operators' performance, providing a job schedule based on task complexity and workers' abilities.",Human Performance; Assembly Tasks; Operator's Performance Index,"INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT, XXVIII IJCIEOM",2022,Conference,"Facchini, F; Cavallo, D; Mummolo, G",10.1007/978-3-031-14763-0_16
From Information Assistance to Cognitive Automation: A Smart Assembly Use Case,"Information assistance helps in many application domains to structure, guide and control human work processes. However, it lacks a formalisation and automated processing of background knowledge which vice versa is required to provide ad-hoc assistance. In this paper, we describe our conceptual and technical work towards this cognitive automation. We focus here on including contextual background knowledge to raise the worker's awareness, guide, and monitor assembly activities. We present cognitive architectures as missing link between highly sophisticated manufacturing data systems and implicitly available contextual knowledge on work procedures and concepts of the work domain. Our work is illustrated with examples in SWI-Prolog and the Soar cognitive architecture which is part of the Plant@Hand assembly assistance system.",,"AGENTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, ICAART 2015",2015,Conference,"Aehnelt, M; Bader, S",10.1007/978-3-319-27947-3_11
Development of the Human-Robot Communication in Welding Technology Manufacturing Cells,"Currently, approx. 29 % of all industrial robots are installed working on the welding processes, the vast majority of them in the automotive industry. They are mostly mounted in the lines of arc welding or spot welding, which are joined with the automated system of handling and transport. In such a configuration, HRC is less important, because the entire manufacturing installation manages the master control system of the line, the hall or the whole plant. In the near future industrial welding robotics await big changes. Clearly it increases interest in robotics among SMEs. The allow for operation of robotic installations through workers with limited physical efficiencies and cognitive abilities is inevitable. It refer elderly and disabled people. It becomes more and more real to put a man in the working area of robots - the idea called collaborative robots. The implementation of these concepts is often dependent on the development of effective, efficient, user friendly Human-Robot-Communication system. The paper presents the development and current state of HRC for welding robots. On this basis the trends and anticipated developments of HRC solutions in the robotic welding installations are described.",Robotics welding; Human-Robot communication,"RECENT ADVANCES IN SYSTEMS, CONTROL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY",2017,Conference,"Pilat, Z; Varga, J; Hajduk, M",10.1007/978-3-319-48923-0_42
Experimental study to investigate mental workload of local vs remote operator in human-machine interaction,"A new Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread globally since 2019. Consequently, businesses from different sectors were forced to work remotely. At the same time, research in this area has seen a rise in studying and emerging technologies that allow and promote such a remote working style; not every sector is equipped for such a transition. The manufacturing sector especially, has faced challenges in this respect. This paper investigates the mental workload (MWL) of two groups of participants through a human-machine interaction task. Participants were required to bring a robotised cell to full production by tuning system and dispensing process parameters. Following the experiment, a self-assessment of the participants' perceived MWL using the raw NASA Task Load Index (RTLX) was collected. The results reveal that remote participants tend to have a lower perceived workload compared to the local participants, but mental demand was deemed higher while performance was rated lower.",Mental workload; NASA-TLX; RTLX; remote working; ergonomics; Human-machine interaction,PRODUCTION AND MANUFACTURING RESEARCH-AN OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL,2022,Journal,"Zimmer, M; Al-Yacoub, A; Ferreira, P; Hubbard, EM; Lohse, N",10.1080/21693277.2022.2090458
Cognitive Load by Context-Sensitive Information Provision Using Binocular Smart Glasses in an Industrial Setting,"New forms of technological work assistance can help to handle the increasing amount and availability of information and support the decision-making processes of employees by providing context-sensitive information. When looking at the vision of Augmented Reality especially binocular see-through smart glasses can be useful for this purpose. Therefore, a strong focus should be put on the analysis of information and interaction design as well as its influence on cognitive load and visual comfort when using it in the working environment. Consequently, two systematic reviews are implemented to examine how to ensure the usability of smart devices and which influence factors on human strain exist due to the information and interaction design of smart glasses. The aim of the reviews is to identify the need of further research in the mentioned topics and derive an experimental setup for investigations on binocular see-through smart glasses. Results indicate that the established usability methods and criteria of conventional screen work are still adequate, but they have to be adjusted to the rapid development of new technologies. As potential influence factors on human strain the accommodation-convergence conflict and the positioning of information for primary as well as secondary task instructions are identified. Furthermore, the question arises, if the possibility to individualize the information provision based on users' needs is helpful to support learning effects and optimize mental strain. Therefore a laboratory study will be carried out, which investigate the described effects.

A Two-Loop Coupled Interaction System Design for Autonomous Driving Scenarios,"The development of automated driving technology gradually detaches the driver from the driving task and allows more interaction in the intelligent cockpit. Problems ensue, as redundancy of interaction information, enhanced cognitive load, and imbalance of resource allocation become increasingly prominent, reducing driver attention and operational efficiency and leading to an imbalance between interactivity and safety. The automotive industry urgently needs to redefine the human-vehicle interaction relationship. In this paper, we construct an interaction design set concept, sort out the interaction-related factors of autonomous driving scenarios, and establish a human-centered intelligent cockpit ring interaction set and a vehicle-centered autonomous driving ring interaction set. The relationship between driving tasks, cognitive contention, user experience and human-machine ergonomics is explored. Visualization through the sets redefines the design methodology and evaluation methodology of interaction systems for present and future autonomous driving scenarios, providing guidance to designers.",Autonomous driving; Interactive Systems; Design Methods; Two-loop,"HCI IN MOBILITY, TRANSPORT, AND AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS, MOBITAS 2024, PT I",2024,Conference,"Cui, MY; Zhang, YH; Zhang, KJ",10.1007/978-3-031-60477-5_8
Challenges for the Operator 3.0 Addressed Through the Enabling Technologies of the Operator 4.0,"Just as human operators are important production enablers in the factories of today, they are expected to stay key enablers also in future manufacturing. In today's factories, operators often meet challenges related to poor information and communication design, which affects their possibilities to perform with higher efficiency levels. Therefore, they need to be provided with better cognitive support tools that are relevant to the challenges to be met. To ensure efficient and effective operator work in the factories of the future, operator support needs to be adequate for the new tasks arising from the evolving operators' roles and work. Within this paper, the results of current operators' work and challenges, based on six case studies, are combined with an outlook of the future of work of operators, based on the Operator 4.0 vision. The challenges categorized in this paper can be used to identify opportunities for improvement in the operators' cognitive support in present factories as well as for researchers and developers of Operator 3.0 support solutions.",Cognitive ergonomics; Operator support; Operator 4.0; Tasks,"ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: TOWARDS SMART AND DIGITAL MANUFACTURING, PT II",2020,Conference,"Tarrar, M; Thorvald, P; Fast-Berglund, Å; Romero, D",10.1007/978-3-030-57997-5_5
Human Factors and Cognitive Engineering in Functional Safety Analysis,"Human factors and cognitive engineering are considered nowadays as important multidisciplinary domains that focus on improving the relations between humans, technology and systems to be supervised and operated. The industrial automation and control systems (IACS) in hazardous plants are increasingly computerized and perform various safety functions. These are usually designed and implemented according to the functional safety requirements. The objective is to maintain high performance and productivity of the plant, and reduce risks related to identified hazards and threats. An approach is proposed to apply selected cognitive engineering methods for verifying the design of safety systems to be implemented in hazardous plant in context of defined safety functions, operator interfaces, procedures and other factors influencing risks.",Human factors; Cognitive engineering; Human reliability analysis; Hazardous plants; Industrial automation and control systems; Functional safety,ADVANCED SOLUTIONS IN DIAGNOSTICS AND FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL,2018,Conference,"Kosmowski, KT",10.1007/978-3-319-64474-5_37
"Requirements Quality Assurance in Industry: Why, What and How?","Context and Motivation: Natural language is the most common form to specify requirements in industry. The quality of the specification depends on the capability of the writer to formulate requirements aimed at different stakeholders: they are an expression of the customer's needs that are used by analysts, designers and testers. Given this central role of requirements as a mean to communicate intention, assuring their quality is essential to reduce misunderstandings that lead to potential waste. Problem: Quality assurance of requirement specifications is largely a manual effort that requires expertise and domain knowledge. However, this demanding cognitive process is also congested by trivial quality issues that should not occur in the first place. Principal ideas: We propose a taxonomy of requirements quality assurance complexity that characterizes cognitive load of verifying a quality aspect from the human perspective, and automation complexity and accuracy from the machine perspective. Contribution: Once this taxonomy is realized and validated, it can serve as the basis for a decision framework of automated requirements quality assurance support.",Requirements engineering; Requirements quality; Natural language processing; Decision support,"REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING: FOUNDATION FOR SOFTWARE QUALITY, REFSQ 2017",2017,Conference,"Unterkalmsteiner, M; Gorschek, T",10.1007/978-3-319-54045-0_6

Effect of Human Interaction Modalities on the Usability and Performance of a Robotic Cyber-Physical System for Construction Progress Monitoring,"The construction industry has been slow to adopt advanced technologies like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), underscoring the necessity for a human-centered approach to their development. This study aims to understand the significance and impact of human-CPS interaction modalities on human perceptions of CPS, specifically in the use case of construction progress monitoring. A mixed-method approach comprising quantitative observations and qualitative interviews was employed to evaluate the system's usability and performance with different human-CPS interaction modalities. The findings reveal variable levels of usability and performance across different human-CPS interaction modalities. Users expressed a preference for the three-dimensional immersive environment compared to a two-dimensional setting due to a better sense of presence. However, they experienced heightened cognitive load when utilizing novel interaction methods such as hand gestures and voice commands. Interestingly, despite this increased cognitive demand, users exhibited comparable performance in the assigned task, irrespective of their familiarity with the interaction modality. The results underscore the importance of human-centered design in CPS development. It contributes empirical evidence crucial for understanding and improving human-CPS interactions, thereby advancing the implementation of CPS in construction progress monitoring.",,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION,2024,Journal,"Halder, S; Afsari, K; Reichard, G",10.1080/10447318.2024.2381931
Eye-tracking support for analyzing human factors in human-robot collaboration during repetitive long-duration assembly processes,"The integration of eye-tracking technology in manufacturing is emerging as a powerful tool for optimizing human performance and well-being in the workplace. Advances in various fields enabled the recent development of smaller, wearable, and wireless eye-tracking devices which are suitable for naturalistically studying manufacturing processes, such as human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, the implementation of eye-tracking for evaluating mental workload in HRC is still limited, especially in long-duration sessions. This paper provides an overview on the application of eye-tracking technology in the context of cognitive ergonomics within the manufacturing sector, with special attention to eye-tracking metrics and their interpretation relatively to human state in long-duration sessions (i.e., work shifts). In addition, an example case study will be presented to explore the reliability of the most common eye-tracking metrics, concerning a repetitive assembly process of 8 h in an HRC setting. Among the explored eye-tracking metrics, pupil dilation, number and average duration of fixations, and number saccades provided useful insights on the mental strain in dynamic conditions. In addition, from the multiple information gathered by eye-tracking, different phenomena related to mental workload were able to be distinguished. The use of cognitive resources resulting from learning process was well detected by pupil dilation, number of fixations and saccades. Mental fatigue, on the other hand, was well detected by the average duration of fixations and the pupil diameter. These results highlight the need to consider multiple eye-tracking metrics simultaneously to obtain a holistic view of the operator's psychophysiological state.",Eye-tracking; Human-robot collaboration; Industry 5.0; Cognitive ergonomics; Mental stress; Mental strain,PRODUCTION ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,2024,Journal,"Gervasi, R; Capponi, M; Mastrogiacomo, L; Franceschini, F",10.1007/s11740-024-01294-y
Towards Cognitive Intelligence-Enabled Manufacturing,"Cognitive intelligence-enabled manufacturing (CoIM) uses machines to utilize technologies that mimic human cognitive abilities to solve complex problems in manufacturing. With the support of a cognitive intelligence-enabled manufacturing system (CoIMS) architecture, information flow is organized and coordinated appropriately, starting from the machine sensory system, central system to the motor system. Machine perceptive abilities monitor, sense and capture equipment performance, aggregate data, and help gain valuable insights into the production process. It uses the industrial internet of things, data analytics, artificial intelligence and related techniques and cognitive computing and related technologies to address production issues in an autonomous manner. As such, CoIMS solves complex production problems. It also transforms manufacturing by improving product quality, productivity, and safety, reducing costs and down-times, identifying knowledge gaps, and enhancing customer experience. Even so, a CoIMS is not responsible for making the final decision. Instead, it supplements information on the fly for engineers to take necessary actions.",Cognitive intelligence; Manufacturing; Self-X cognition; Smart decision making; Artificial intelligence,"ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: SMART MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS SYSTEMS: TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION, APMS 2022, PT II",2022,Conference,"Agbozo, RSK; Zheng, P; Peng, T; Tang, RZ",10.1007/978-3-031-16411-8_50
Human-centred design of ergonomic workstations on interactive digital mock-ups,"Analysis of human-related aspects is fundamental to guarantee workers' wellbeing, which directly limits errors and risks during task execution, increases productivity, and reduces cost [1].

Ethical Issues Invoked by Industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 is universally referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. It is a current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. The computerisation of manufacturing includes, amongst other, cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and cognitive computing. There are many challenges in the realisation of Industry 4.0. In order to adopt a smart factory and improved (software) processes many ethical considerations need to be identified and considered if a company is to obtain an ethical development and deployment of Industry 4.0. The purpose of normative ethics is to scrutinise standards about the rightness and wrongness of actions, the ultimate goal being the identification of the true human good. A rational appeal can be made to normative defensible ethical rules in order to arrive at a judicious, ethically justifiable judgement. In this position and constructive design research paper our steps are: First we report on the findings of a broad literature review of related research, which refers to the current challenges in the realisation of Industry 4.0. Second, we identify and list some basic generic Deontological and Teleological ethical principles and theories that can serve as normative guidelines for addressing the challenges identified in the initial step. Third, we prescribe a set of ethical rights and duties that must be exercised and fulfilled by protagonists/stakeholders in Industry 4.0 implementation in order for them to exhibit ethical behaviour. Each of these suggested actions are substantiated via an appeal to one, or a number of the normative guidelines, identified in the second step. By identifying and recommending a set of defensible ethical obligations that must be fulfilled in the development and deployment of smart factories, protagonists such as: employers, project managers, technology suppliers, trade unions, (on a microscopic level) and chambers of commerce, local and national government (on a macroscopic level) and other can fulfil their ethical duties. Thus, a deployed Industry 4.0 solution can result in technological change, social change and changes in the business paradigm, which are all ethically justifiable. Ultimately all the improvement processes of Industry 4.0 implementation must be underpinned with ethical consideration",Normative ethics; Industry 4.0; Cyber-physical systems,"SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES PROCESS IMPROVEMENT, EUROSPI 2021",2021,Conference,"Rahanu, H; Georgiadou, E; Siakas, K; Ross, M; Berki, E",10.1007/978-3-030-85521-5_39
Embodied Interactions in Cognitive Manufacturing,"This paper presents a discussion on the role of embodied interaction with a basis in social embodiment effects and how they can be viewed in light of manufacturing ergonomics. The social embodiment effects are four statements, grounded in empirical findings, which highlight the interplay of social stimuli, embodied responses, and cognitive processing. They suggest and base an argument for how embodiment is central to cognitive processing, how bodily states interact extensively with cognitive states, and ultimately how embodied interaction is ubiquitous in human cognition. The paper further presents a view on how human based manufacturing can be studied in light of this argument, exploring other areas where social embodiment has been further researched, with an aim to suggest examples of where social embodiment effects might be found in manufacturing ergonomics and form a basis for future investigations.",Manufacturing; Social embodiment.cognition; Human based manufacturing.ergonomics,ADVANCES IN NEUROERGONOMICS AND COGNITIVE ENGINEERING,2020,Conference,"Thorvald, P; Lindblom, J; Kolbeinsson, A",10.1007/978-3-030-20473-0_41
Real-Time Inspection of Multi-sided Surface Defects Based on PANet Model,"Quality of products is the most important factor in manufacturing. Machine vision is a technique that mainly performs human cognitive judgment in the industrial field or performs a task that is generally difficult for a human. However the detection of traditional methods of scanning with human eyes has many difficulties due to repetitive tasks. Recently, an artificial intelligence machine vision has been studied to improve these problems. Using the vision inspection system, it is possible to collect information such as the number of products, defect detection, and types without human intervention, which maximizes the operation-al efficiency of a company such as productivity improvement, quality improvement, and cost reduction. Most of the vision inspection systems currently in use are single-sided images, which collect and inspect one image of the product. However, in the actual manufacturing industry, products that are valid for single-sided image inspection are limited to some product groups, and most require multi-sided image inspection. In addition, the inspection system used in the field must meet the production speed required by the actual manufacturing site and inspect the defects of the product. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based vision inspection system that satisfies the multi-sided image inspection and fast production speed of products. By implementing seven cameras and optical technology, multi-sided images of the product are collected simultaneously, and a defect in the product can be quickly detected in real time using a PANet (Path Aggregation Network) model. Through the proposed system, it is possible to inspect product defects at the level required at the manufacturing site, and the information obtained in the inspection process will be used as a very important data to evaluate and improve product quality.",AI; Deep learning; Machine vision; Defect inspection; PANet,"COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS - ICCSA 2020, PT II",2020,Conference,"Han, Y; Jeong, J",10.1007/978-3-030-58802-1_45
Design for assembly meaning: a framework for designers to design products that support operator cognition during the assembly process,"Designing assembly instructions is mostly considered to be a non-designer task. Hence, in many companies, it is performed by production planners or instructional designers. However, analysing product components and looking for clues on how these components can be fitted together into a subassembly or final product is a fundamental part of assembly. Product designers play an important role in the way these components are perceived by the operator. This paper discusses the need and importance of a new approach to product design focused on how the assembly design can promote meaning to the operator, supporting operator cognition. The aim of this approach was to guide assembly operators more intuitively through their increasingly complex tasks. Doing so will allow them to avoid some of the major drawbacks that are present when using procedural instructions. Hence, this approach has the potential to decrease cognitive load and frustration, and increase mental wellbeing, work motivation and efficiency. As a first step towards this new approach, a conceptual framework is constructed, and insights are formulated after reviewing various design theories and concepts of design for meaning on their potential in a context of manual assembly.",Product design; Manual assembly; Meaning; Cognition,COGNITION TECHNOLOGY & WORK,2020,Journal,"Parmentier, DD; Van Acker, BB; Detand, J; Saldien, J",10.1007/s10111-019-00588-x
VoTrE: A Vocational Training and Evaluation System to Compare Training Approaches for the Workplace,"Extensive research has been carried out in using computer-based techniques to train and prepare workers for various industry positions. Most of this research focuses on how to best enable the workers to perform a type of task safely and efficiently. In fact, many of the accidents in manufacturing and construction environments are due to the lack of proper training needed for employees. In this study, we compare the impact of three types of training approaches on the planning and problem-solving abilities of a trainee while he/she performs the Towers of Hanoi (TOH) task. The three approaches are (a) traditional (with a human trainer), (b) gamification (game-based training simulation), and (c) computer-aided training. The aim of this study is to evaluate a worker's level of functioning and problem-solving skills based on a specific training approach. Exact assessment of functional capacities is an important prerequisite to ensure effective and personalized training.

Prototypes of the interface were designed based on the EID and UCD which were undergoing NASA-TLX to evaluation the subjective workload of the users. The main findings of this study were as follows: (1) we found that the ecological interface design and user-centered design had significant differences in each levels; (2) the ecological interface design has a significant better effect on subjective workload compare to user-centered design in the complex electronics manufacturing systems (P < 0.05).

Grounded Approach for Understanding Changes in Human Emotional States in Real Time Using Psychophysiological Sensory Apparatuses,"This paper discusses the technical and philosophical challenges that researchers and practitioners face when attempting to classify human emotion based upon raw physiological data. It proposes the use of a representational learning approach that adopts techniques from industrial internet of things (IoT) solutions. It applies this approach to the classification of emotional states using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor data. The algorithm used first pre-processes the data using a combination of signal processing and vector quantization techniques. Next, it found the optimal number of natural clusters within human emotional states and used these as the target variables for either shallow or for deep learning classification. The deep learning variant used a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to form a compressive representation of the input data prior to classification. A final single layer perception model learned the relationship between the input and output states. This approach would be useful for detecting real-time changes in human emotional state. It is able automatically create emotional states that are both highly separable and balanced. It is able to distinguish between low v. high emotional states across all tasks (F1-score of 71.4%) and is better at forming this distinction for tasks intended to elicit higher cognitive load such as the Tetris video game (F1-score of 87.1%) or the Multi Attribute Task Battery (F1-score of 77%).",Affective computing; Cognitive computing; Brain signal processing; Brain computer interfaces; Decision-making; Decision support systems; DSS; Machine learning; Deep learning; Classification,"AUGMENTED COGNITION: NEUROCOGNITION AND MACHINE LEARNING, AC 2017, PT I",2017,Conference,"Kirk, RA",10.1007/978-3-319-58628-1_26

Cognitive Engineering for Process Safety: Effective Training for Process Operators Using Eye Gaze Patterns,"Control room operator errors are considered a major reason for accidents in the process industries. Inadequate training for operators is often considered one of the major causes of such accidents. A research report aimed at improved crew resource management in the Oil and Gas industry suggested that a systematic analysis for trends in human factors causes of accidents is important for development of operator training program. In addition process safety experts suggest training program with emphasis on operator decision making process for operator learning enhancement. Eye tracker based studies have been devoted to learning enhancement in various safety critical domains. In our previous research, we employed an eye tracker and observed the existence of characteristic gaze patterns for successful chemical plant operators. In this work, we use these eye gaze patterns along with results from a game based learning approach to develop a training methodology to impart process knowledge to plant operators.

The future of manufacturing: Utopia or dystopia?,"Digital manufacturing technologies (DMTs) have the potential to transform industry productivity, but their introduction into the workplace is often a complex process, requiring not only technical expertise but also an awareness of ethical and societal challenges surrounding human-system integration. Concerns about the introduction of new technology have been prevalent throughout history, and exploring public perceptions of these technologies can provide insight to help address such cultural anxieties. However, evaluating user perceptions of futuristic technology is difficult, requiring novel approaches to provide context and understanding. To explore users' perceptions of future DMTs, we applied the ContraVision technique in a questionnaire-based study. Participants viewed films, representing fictionalized utopic and dystopic visions of what the future of these DMTs might involve, and a questionnaire probed the perceptions of the technologies afterward. Findings showed that irrespective of the way technology was portrayed, participants had concerns about the ethical and responsible implementation of these tools. Participant responses were analyzed to identify key challenges for policy surrounding DMT implementation in the future of manufacturing.",ContraVision technique; digital manufacturing; ethics; Industry 4; 0; public perceptions,HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS IN MANUFACTURING & SERVICE INDUSTRIES,2023,Journal,"Marinescu, A; Argyle, EM; Duvnjak, J; Wilson, ML; Lawson, G; Sharples, S; Hubbard, EM; Justham, L",10.1002/hfm.20976
Deep convolutional neural network object net model based cognitive digital twin for trust in human-robot collaborative manufacturing,"A Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) is an artificial intelligence enhanced version of a digital twin, mirroring and learning from its physical counterpart. A cognitive digital twin in Human-Robot Collaborative (HRC) manufacturing generates synthetic robot data to build trust through simulating and monitoring collaborative behaviours, enhancing efficiency and safety. This encounter issues like restricted trust, inefficiency in extracting crucial details, difficulties in precise detection and alignment of bounding boxes with object boundaries, and high computational complexity. To overcome these challenges, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Object Net (DCNNONet) model is proposed. The adaptive non local moment mean filter enhances image preprocessing, optimizing noise suppression and texture preservation. Utilizing proposed model, which includes featuring EfficientNetB7, a hybrid pixel unshuffled network, and long-edge decomposition rotated bounding box encoding, effectively tackles these issues, surpasses in feature extraction and precise object detection. Additionally, the introduced enhanced growth optimizer refines model parameters, reducing overall computational complexity. The introduced scheme exhibits better performance, attaining high accuracy, mean average precision, and sensitivity, and F1-Score of 99.96%, 98.5%, 99.75% and 99.89%, respectively. This model enhances trust by providing reliable insights, increasing accuracy in manufacturing scenario interpretation, and improving precision, optimizing performance in collaborative environments.",Cognitive digital twin; Human robot collaborative; Efficientnetb7; Rotated bounding box encoding; Enhanced growth optimizer,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING,2024,Journal,"Ramkumar, A; Balasubramanian, G",10.1007/s10845-024-02501-4
Study on Interaction Modalities Between Humans and CPS in Sociotechnical Systems,"Nowadays, digitization and automation in manufacturing and logistics facilities lead to cyber-physical systems (CPS) which are interacting with one another and are able to handle complex and yet very flexible processes. Still there are many tasks, which cannot be handled by these CPS, and therefore, the human worker with his cognitive abilities plays a major role in such systems. To enhance the collaboration between CPS and human workers new forms of bidirectional interaction have to be setup and evaluated. In this paper, we analyzed the interaction methods of an automated transport vehicle (ATV). The ATV can be controlled via app on smartphones or tablets, gesture recognition using sensor wristbands or speech control. To obtain information about which interaction possibility should be used we have conducted a case study in which users had to control the ATV by all three modalities. During the evaluation, we examined the feedback of the user on the Likert-scale as well as objectionable information like task fulfillment time and error rate. These results helped us to identify the right interaction modality regarding the interaction task.",Human factors; User experience; Human-Robot-Interaction,"HUMAN SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND DESIGN, IHSED2018",2019,Conference,"Chapman, S; Kirks, T; Jost, J",10.1007/978-3-030-02053-8_159
Bioinspiration in Affective Motion Planning of an Anthropomorphic Robot for Affect-Based Human-Robot Collaborative Manufacturing,"Affect-based robot-human communication is a nonverbal communication method that can help the robot communicate its mental states to the collaborating human during human-robot collaborative manufacturing. Such communication can make the manufacturing situations (events) transparent to the human and also impact the cognitive abilities of the human. All these may impact the overall manufacturing performance positively. In this paper, an anthropomorphic robot with affect display ability is used to collaborate with its human partner so that they can collaboratively assemble several parts to manufacture a finished product. Firstly, in order to receive bioinspiration, the affective features in a similar human-human collaborative assembly task arc investigated. Secondly, based on the human's affective features, the affect dynamics (the computational model of affect) for the robot is derived for the collaborative assembly task. Thirdly, based on the affect model, an affect-based intelligent motion planning strategy for the robot is developed so that the robot can dynamically adjust its affective states like a human with changes in the assembly task situations during the human-robot collaborative assembly task to make the assembly situations transparent to the human. Finally, the potential impacts of the proposed bio-inspired dynamic affect-based robot motion planning on human-robot interaction and manufacturing performance are discussed.",affect; bioinspiration; human-robot collaboration; cognition; motion planning; manufacturing,2019 IEEE SOUTHEASTCON,2019,Conference,"Rahman, SMM",10.1109/southeastcon42311.2019.9020581
Emotional Responses of the Disabled Towards Wheelchairs,"Ergonomics should not consider the physical and cognitive aspects of the human personality only, but other aspects such as emotions and spiritualties in order to be accepted by people. In the 21st century, all designs are anticipated to consider emotions. The wheelchair industry in Algeria was initiated as a fully governmental industry, but lately, private manufacturing institutions have emerged. The aim of this paper is to answer the following questions: (1) What are the emotional responses of the disabled towards wheelchairs in Algeria? (2) Do these responses differ according to demographic characteristics (gender, and disability type)? A sample of 74 disabled wheelchair users were asked for their emotional response towards wheelchairs using Geneva Emotional Wheel. Results indicated that emotional responses of wheelchair users varied in terms of emotions and emotion strength. Also the emotional responses varied according to the type of disability and gender.",Emotional design; Wheelchairs; The disabled; Algeria,ADVANCES IN AFFECTIVE AND PLEASURABLE DESIGN (AHFE 2017),2018,Conference,"Mokdad, M; Mebarki, B; Bouabdellah, L; Mokdad, I",10.1007/978-3-319-60495-4_10
Sex Parity in Cognitive Fatigue Model Development for Effective Human-Robot Collaboration,"In recent years, robots have become vital to achieving manufacturing competitiveness. Especially in industrial environments, a strong level of interaction is reached when humans and robots form a dynamic system that works together towards achieving a common goal or accomplishing a task. However, the human-robot collaboration can be cognitively demanding, potentially contributing to cognitive fatigue. Therefore, the consideration of cognitive fatigue becomes particularly important to ensure the efficiency and safety in the overall human-robot collaboration. Additionally, sex is an inevitable human factor that needs further investigation for machine learning model development given the perceptual and physiological differences between the sexes in responding to fatigue. As such, this study explored sex differences and labeling strategies in the development of machine learning models for cognitive fatigue detection. Sixteen participants, balanced by sex, recruited to perform a surface finishing task with a UR10 collaborative robot under fatigued and non-fatigued states. Fatigue perception and heart rate activity data collected throughout to create a dataset for cognitive fatigue detection. Equitable machine learning models developed based on perception (survey responses) and condition (fatigue manipulation). The labeling approach had a significant impact on the accuracy and F1-score, where perception-based labels lead to lower accuracy and F1-score for females likely due to sex differences in reporting of fatigue. Additionally, we observed a relationship between heart rate, algorithm type, and labeling approach, where heart rate was the most significant predictor for the two labeling approaches and for all the algorithms utilized. Understanding the implications of label type, algorithm type, and sex on the design of fatigue detection algorithms is essential to designing equitable fatigue-adaptive human-robot collaborations across the sexes.",ECG; human factors; human-robot collaboration; machine learning; sex differences; robot adaptation,2022 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS),2022,Conference,"Kalatzis, A; Hopko, S; Mehta, RK; Stanley, L; Wittie, MP",10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981097
Cognitive work in future manufacturing systems: Human-centered AI for joint work with models,"Manufacturers perpetually adapt their systems to meet unforeseen events, new objectives, competition, and improved understanding of processes. In that human-directed work, models mediate an enduring relationship between production resources and engineers. Accommodating new understanding in the models controlling production can lead to more effective manufacturing. That work has previously been the province of quality programs such as Six Sigma, but is now fertile ground to study human-computer interaction about that enduring relationship mediated by models. Can AI augment human capability in the arcane work of formulating and refining models? This question is relevant to complex system engineering generally, not just manufacturing. In answering this question, this paper adapts Klein's flexecution for use in adaptable manufacturing systems. Theory flexecution, the methodical refinement of models, points to human-computer interactions that emphasize the roles of models, explanation, and machine agents that recognize the engineer's goals. This perspective article illustrates these ideas with an example of formulating models for production scheduling.",Human/AI teaming; joint cognitive work; domain-specific languages; manufacturing; AI copilot,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,2024,Journal,"Denno, P",10.3233/JID-230035
A Technology Corner for Operator Training in Manufacturing Tasks,"This study is part of a project carried out in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles with the aim of introducing innovation and Industry 4.0 technologies in workers' training. Nowadays, the training is performed using a system, called Manufacturing Training System (MTS), composed by three different areas: a document area in which there are step method procedures, quick kaizen and operation cards for each work phase; an ability corner with tools useful to perform activities and a simulated production line on which the operator can practice. The iterative process with a multidisciplinary design a project was built up, keeping in mind User Center Design principles and focusing on the active engagement of the user in each design stage, to validate what actions users can be asked to perform and what tasks the system has to do automatically. In the first phase, the Cognitive Ergonomists observed and interviewed Team Leaders, workers that coordinate and manage other co-workers and know critical issues of their domain tasks. In a second phase, the so-called personas tool with specific characteristics and scenarios was used to analyze users' needs. After that the new training system features were defined. Thanks to requirement definition, four thematic areas were defined: ergonomics and safety, documents and procedures, equipment and workstation and operating procedures. For each area, the training was divided into learning and practical exercises. Based on this approach, different tools have been chosen for each area. For example Augmented Reality was used for learning and acquiring information and notions, and Gamification Techniques were used for the practical exercises. Furthermore, storyboards were proposed as a new tool to help the learning process. Soon, mock-ups could be implemented to easily test with workers, validate project hypothesis, find critical issues and further support successful approaches.",UCD for training; Personas; Scenario based design; Augmented Reality; Gamification,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 20TH CONGRESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ERGONOMICS ASSOCIATION (IEA 2018), VOL VII: ERGONOMICS IN DESIGN, DESIGN FOR ALL, ACTIVITY THEORIES FOR WORK ANALYSIS AND DESIGN, AFFECTIVE DESIGN",2019,Conference,"Gilotta, S; Spada, S; Ghibaudo, L; Isoardi, M",10.1007/978-3-319-96071-5_96
Establishing a modified CREAM approach for reliability evaluation,"The human factors area is one of the core field of industrial safety. It is deeply recognized that human factors are the main cause of accidents and breakdowns in various industries. Physiological mental states of human operators, like fatigue or vigilance, are crucial for the evaluation of human operators reliability. However, the shortages of measurements of physiological mental states limit their application. So human reliability analysis (HRA) is developed and many techniques have been developed. Among these techniques, cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM) is often applied and discussed. Due to the application limits of common performance conditions (CPCs) in original CREAM approach, it is advised to generate a new list of CPCs for the application domain if CREAM approach is applied to other domains. In this contribution, a new approach defining a situated and dynamical human reliability measure is established. The approach is based on the well-known CREAM approach, which is modified with respect to the use in dynamical context. The new list of CPCs, their levels and corresponding effects on human reliability are determined. A new index, human performance reliability score (HPRS), is proposed for the assessment of human operator reliability. Finally, the applicability and correctness of the newly established approach is verified by data analysis.",human operators; physiological mental states; human reliability analysis; CREAM; CPCs; situated driving context,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS (ICHMS),2020,Conference,"He, C; Söffker, D",10.1109/ichms49158.2020.9209509
Confirmation dialog box in the physical world: design strategies on tangible confirmation behavior in human-machine interaction,"In tangible irreversible human-machine interactions (HMIs), erroneous inputs resulting from users' unfamiliarity, inattention, or ingrained habits can lead to unintended consequences. Although some design measures like buttons with protective shells or safety switches before critical actions have been implemented to minimize human errors in both everyday products and industrial interfaces, a cohesive guiding strategy on when, where, and how to prevent unintended consequences is lacking. Inspired by the confirmation dialog boxes commonly utilized in graphical user interfaces, this study proposes design strategies for effective tangible confirmation behaviors in HMIs. Initially, a workshop was conducted to gather design cases and explore potential design opportunities in future scenarios. By analysing the outcomes, we propose an evaluation method for assessing the necessity and complexity requirements of confirmation design and introduce a design library considering complexity levels graded by users' time, effort, and cognitive load expenditure. Subsequently, a user behavior experiment was conducted to validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed strategies. Our strategies offer valuable references for designers, highlighting the significance of confirmation design in preventing human errors. Following these strategies, designers and engineers can integrate more Kansai engineering principles into HMIs to ensure user safety, protect property, and enhance interaction efficiency.",Human-machine interaction; safety design; design strategies; irreversibility; confirmation design,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN,2024,Journal,"Zhang, YY; Lou, SH; Zhang, YB; Pan, DY; Fan, YT; Jian, Y; Ren, L; Hu, B; Tang, X; Chen, LQ; Huang, H; Wang, GY; Tao, Y",10.1080/09544828.2024.2398396
Divided Attention in Human-Robot Teaming: Assessing Performance in Large-Scale Interactive Virtual Environments,"This paper explores division of attention for people in human-robot teaming within immersive virtual environments (IVEs), focusing on search tasks where a supervisor oversees multiple robots distributed across various locations. We examine how spatial separation of robot teams affects supervisors' attention, performance, workload, and situational awareness. We investigate the cognitive impact of managing geographically divided teams. The study also considers how head movement and locomotion, activities involving crucial spatial cues, influence visual attention and spatial memory in complex tasks. Two experiments are conducted to analyze these effects in this applied setting, which could inform command and control structures for robot teams. The results of this research inform spatial attention for large-scale IVEs and could have broader implications for designing effective human-robot collaborations in various fields such as defense, search and rescue, and manufacturing.",spatial attention; immersive virtual environments; human-robot teams,"SPATIAL COGNITION XIII, SPATIAL COGNITION 2024",2024,Conference,"Xie, XS; McNamara, TP; Bodenheimer, B",10.1007/978-3-031-63115-3_8
Why consider the human-in-the-loop in automated cyber-physical production systems? Two cases from cross-company cooperation,"Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Production can increase efficiency and effectiveness of workflows in manufacturing companies and production networks. Despite ubiquitous automation, people are essential in socio-technical cyber-physical production systems due to unique cognitive capabilities, as final arbitrators, or for ethical and legal reasons. However, the design of interfaces between the human-in-the-loop and production systems poses challenges not yet been sufficiently elaborated in research and practice. We present two behavioural studies in the context of inter-company collaboration that show why considering the human-in-the-loop is crucial: The first study shows that information complexity and individual differences shape the overall decision quality. With increasing information complexity, the decision speed decreases and the decision accuracy descends. Consequently, a fine balance between necessary, abundant, and superfluous information must be found. The second experiment studies human decision making in complex environments using a business simulation. We found that correct decision aids can augment the human-in-the-loop's decision making and that these can increase usability, trust, and proft. Yet, incorrect decision support has the opposite effect.

Cognitive and Emotional-Motivational Aspects of Communication to Improve Work Safety in Production Processes: Case Study,"The aim of the publication is to emphasize the role of effective communication practices in shaping and maintaining a high level of occupational safety in production processes. Theoretical considerations were supported by a synthetic review of research results and supplemented by a case study of a manufacturing company. The study exploits the author's questionnaire for the Communication Performance Assessment in the area of Health and Safety (CPA-OHS). The results of the research clearly indicate deficits in vertical communication - between employees and supervisors. The main problems are related to the lack of freedom in daily communication between employees and management and a low level of mutual understanding. The survey showed that the consequences of the current problems in the area of interpersonal communication may be intensified in the near future as a result of a deep reconstruction of the human-machine relationship, based for the first time in the history of civilization on cooperation with non-human intelligence.",Human factors; Health and safety; Interpersonal and group communication; Safety culture; Behavior-based safety (BBS); Industry 4.0,"ADVANCES IN MANUFACTURING, PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS CONTROL",2020,Conference,"Sadlowska-Wrzesinska, J",10.1007/978-3-030-20494-5_32
"Physiological indicators of task demand, fatigue, and cognition in future digital manufacturing environments","As Digital Manufacturing transforms traditionally physical work into more system-monitoring tasks, new methods are required for understanding people's mental workload and prolonged capacity for focused attention. Many physiological measures have shown promise for detecting changes in cognitive state, and recent advances in sensor technology offer minimally-invasive ways to monitor our cognitive activity. Previous research in functional near-infrared spectroscopy, for example, has observed changes in cerebral hemodynamic response during periods of high demand within tasks. This work investigated the relationships among task demand, fatigue, and attention degradation in a sustained attention task, and their effect on heart rate, breathing rate, nose temperature and hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus. Analysis revealed a small but significant effect of fatigue on heart rate relative to baseline, breathing rate and hemodynamic response. Task demand had a small but significant effect on breathing rate and nose temperature, both relative to baseline, but no difference between levels of demand was observed in heart rate or hemodynamic response. Our results provide insight into what physiological data can tell us about cognitive state, ability to focus, and the impact of fatigue over time.",mental workload; fatigue; task-unrelated thought; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; heart rate; breathing rate; facial thermography; physiological sensing,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES,2021,Journal,"Argyle, EM; Marinescu, A; Wilson, ML; Lawson, G; Sharples, S",10.1016/j.ijhcs.2020.102522
Key human factors and their effects on human centered assembly performance,"Today in the increasingly competitive market, consumers prefer to have a great variety of products to choose from; this preference is often coupled with demands for a relatively smaller lot size, shorter lead time, higher quality and lower cost. Consequently, manufacturing companies are being forced to consistently increase flexibility and responsiveness of their production systems in order to accommodate changes of the fluctuating market. Among various forms of production systems, human-centred manufacturing systems can offer such a capability in dealing with product variations and production volumes as human workers can always adapt themselves to perform multiple tasks after a learning process. However, human performance can also be unpredictable and it may alter due to varying psychological and physiological states, which are often overlooked by researchers when designing, implementing or evaluating a manufacturing system. This paper presents a study aiming to address these issues by exploring human factors and their interactions that may affect human performance on human-centred assembly systems. The study was carried out based on a literature review and an industrial survey. Critical system performance indicators, which are affected by human factors, were evaluated and the most significant human factors were identified using the fuzzy extent analysis method. The research findings show that experience is the most significant human factor that affects individual human performance, compared to age and general cognitive abilities in human-centred assembly. By contrast, both human reaction time and job satisfaction have the least effect on human performance. The significance of ageing on human performance was also studied and it was concluded that average assembly time of human workers rises by average 1% per year after the age of 38 years old.",Manufacturing systems; Human factors; Assembly; Fuzzy extent analysis; Ageing,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS,2019,Journal,"Abubakar, MI; Wang, Q",10.1016/j.ergon.2018.09.009
Cognitive Cyber-Physical System (C-CPS) for Human-Robot Collaborative Manufacturing,"In this paper, the fundamental concept of the newly coined framework C-CPS (cognitive cyber-physical system) is introduced with application to human-robot collaborative manufacturing. A human-robot hybrid cell is developed where a human and a robot collaborate to perform assembly of components in manufacturing. Human and robot's mutual trust, an expression of human and machine cognition, is modeled and computed in real-time for the collaborative task. In the proposed C-CPS framework, a cyber system (software system) along with necessary hardware (sensors) computes the mutual trust in real-time based on the performance and precision of the physical system (human and robot). The computed mutual trust is then communicated to the robot via the software system and to the human via a visual interface. The computed trust values are also used to control the motion of the robot based on an algorithm, and to stimulate the action of the human based on warnings communicated to the human via the visual interface. The performance of the physical system also impacts the cyber system (computing), and the vice versa. The framework is implemented with an actual human-robot collaborative assembly task. The experimental evaluation results show satisfactory performance of the proposed C-CPS in term of human-system interaction, manufacturing efficiency and quality.",,2019 14TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (SOSE),2019,Conference,"Rahman, SMM",10.1109/sysose.2019.8753835
Towards augmenting cyber-physical-human collaborative cognition for human-automation interaction in complex manufacturing and operational environments,"The importance of augmenting human-technology collaborative cognition has been envisioned as one of the fundamental ways to bolster human cognition through human-automation interaction in complex manufacturing and operational environments.

Neuro-inspired Framework for Cognitive Manufacturing Control,"There are currently certain categories of manufacturing enterprises whose structure, organization and operating context have an extremely high degree of complexity, especially due to the way in which their various components interact and influence each other.

Ergonomics of Design - Problems in Making the Project a Reality,"Introduction: The analysis based on ergonomics, used in this study, seeks not only to adjust questions related to risk factors and musculoskeletal disorders, but also to redefine a productive process that may be altered. Studies based on activities carried out in the boiler operation are not many, and the studies are based more on the production and mechanisms of the same, relating productivity and decrease in the levels of pollution. Thus, this study will address several points of the boiler operator's activity, in order to solve the proposed demand (skeletal muscle issue and productivity). Methods: An ergonomic analysis was performed divided in three phases. The first phase (generalist) was a collection of data about the company, the specific function and the sector that makes up the function (general organization, tasks and production). In the second phase, a pre-diagnosis of the analyzed function was presented. Finally, ergonomic evaluation methods (interview, real analysis, application of ergonomic tool) were applied to confront the initial demand. After this, in the third phase, a final diagnosis and recommendations were made to adapt the current situation of the activities. Results: The company evaluated has around 370 employees, including the production, recycling and reuse of paper sector. The evaluated sector (Boiler) has six active employees, in three shifts (two employees per shift). The development of the work focused on the boiler operator was informed about the issues involving the boiler-to-gas exchange by the steam boiler. Being the consumption of the new boiler, much bigger than the previous one. Through the data passed by the company, there was a possible pre-diagnosis focused on cognitive and musculoskeletal issues (demand from employee reports about function). Numerous operative modes were observed during the performance of the function and this is due to a technical error of the boiler mat, which causes the worker to have to organize the wood logs inside the boiler box after they have left the conveyor). The boiler project, even if tested and simulated, when it became real presented variables that went unnoticed in the project's idealization.

Applying Human Cognition to Assured Autonomy,"The scaled deployment of semi- and fully autonomous systems undeniably depends on assured autonomy. This reality, however, has become far more complex than expected because it necessarily demands an integrated tripartite solution not yet achieved: consensus-based standards and compliance across industry, scientific innovation within artificial intelligence R&D of explainability, and robust end-user education. In this is paper I present my human-centered approach to the design, development, and deployment of autonomous systems and break down how human factors such as cognitive and behavioral insights into how we think, feel, act, plan, make decisions, and problem-solve are foundational to assuring autonomy.",Assured autonomy; Artificial intelligence; Human factors; Trust; Explainability; Autonomous vehicles,"HCI INTERNATIONAL 2021 - LATE BREAKING PAPERS: MULTIMODALITY, EXTENDED REALITY, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE",2021,Conference,"López-González, M",10.1007/978-3-030-90963-5_36
Using action research to develop human factors approaches to improve assembly quality during early design and ramp-up of an assembly line,"Engineers at a large electronics new product initiation site were interested in developing human factors (HF) approaches to help improve assembly quality during two stages of their production assembly design: early design of tasks, fixtures and tooling; and during early ramp-up of new assembly lines at outsourcing sites. Researchers worked in an action research approach with company engineers and ergonomists to integrate HF into both design stages. This paper presents the human factors approaches and discusses the challenges of using human factors to improve assembly quality. For the first stage of early design, a HF-design for assembly (HF-DFA) scorecard was developed with 22 items scored on a 0 (no risk or problem) to 2 (high risk or problems) scale. Items included physical risks, such as grip size and force, movement risks, such as re-grasping or re-orienting, visual risks, such as visual accuracy and inspection difficulty, and cognitive issues such as ability to detect a problem and risk of damage to part or component. High scores were associated with assembly tasks that were both reported as difficult by operators, and also had quality problems. The HF-DFA was adopted as a controlled engineering document and used to proactively score assembly tasks prior to final design of tasks, fixtures and tooling. In the second stage of early ramp, researchers combined the HF-DFA and other HF and performance-based metrics into a modified HF-house of quality (HF-HoQ) approach where the focus was on worker requirements rather than the traditional customer requirements. The HF-HoQwas evaluated using video of four identical tasks performed at different outsourcing locations that had a seven-fold difference in defect rates. The HF-HoQ successfully detected the site with the highest defect rate, but not the lowest. The authors recommend further testing and development of approaches that attempt to bring insight from HF to the issue of improving assembly quality. Relevance to industry: Human factors is broader than injury prevention, and has been linked to assembly quality. Two HF approaches were developed to help improve quality in early design stages and during early ramp-up of assembly lines. Companies are encouraged to develop and evaluate HF approaches for improving assembly quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of Robotic Expertise and Task Knowledge on Physical Ergonomics and Joint Efficiency in a Human-Robot Collaboration Task,"With the trend of low batch manufacturing, more and more small and medium enterprises are leaning towards adopting collaborative robots to increase productivity and improve operator well-being. However, robots are often programmed by robot experts rather than the operators effectively working with the machine. Therefore, operators may perceive low levels of task autonomy due to the unpredictability of robot motions. Empowering operators to make their own choices regarding robot motions can improve such feelings. However, research in cognitive science shows that allowing operators to decide on robot motions in a collaborative task could be influenced by how people consider their travel path and their partner's action. To better understand these relations, considering preliminary results from a previous study, we designed a user study where we tested operators' decisions in a collaborative task where groups of robot experts and novices were asked to choose their preferred task configuration among four possible options that differed in terms of operators' physical ergonomics and robot travel path. Our results show that robotic experts prioritize joint team work rather than their ergonomics. Contrarily, novices prioritize individual efforts and tend to reduce the robot travel path while keeping their travel path constant, maintaining good physical ergonomics. In conclusion, providing operators with task decision autonomy can be advantageous, but operator background must be considered to ensure optimal physical ergonomics and travel paths.",physical ergonomics; robotic expertise; joint action; coordination; decision making,"2023 IEEE-RAS 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANOID ROBOTS, HUMANOIDS",2023,Conference,"Pantano, M; Curioni, A; Regulin, D; Kamps, T; Lee, D",10.1109/HUMANOIDS57100.2023.10375163
Human-Robot Collaboration With a Corrective Shared Controlled Robot in a Sanding Task,"Objective Physical and cognitive workloads and performance were studied for a corrective shared control (CSC) human-robot collaborative (HRC) sanding task.Background Manual sanding is physically demanding. Collaborative robots (cobots) can potentially reduce physical stress, but fully autonomous implementation has been particularly challenging due to skill, task variability, and robot limitations. CSC is an HRC method where the robot operates semi-autonomously while the human provides real-time corrections.Methods Twenty laboratory participants removed paint using an orbital sander, both manually and with a CSC robot. A fully automated robot was also tested.Results The CSC robot improved subjective discomfort compared to manual sanding in the upper arm by 29.5%, lower arm by 32%, hand by 36.5%, front of the shoulder by 24%, and back of the shoulder by 17.5%. Muscle fatigue measured using EMG, was observed in the medial deltoid and flexor carpi radialis for the manual condition. The composite cognitive workload on the NASA-TLX increased by 14.3% for manual sanding due to high physical demand and effort, while mental demand was 14% greater for the CSC robot. Digital imaging showed that the CSC robot outperformed the automated condition by 7.16% for uniformity, 4.96% for quantity, and 6.06% in total.Conclusions In this example, we found that human skills and techniques were integral to sanding and can be successfully incorporated into HRC systems. Humans performed the task using the CSC robot with less fatigue and discomfort.Applications The results can influence implementation of future HRC systems in manufacturing environments.",human-robot collaboration; corrective shared control; fatigue; discomfort; manufacturing,HUMAN FACTORS,2024,Journal,"Konstant, A; Orr, N; Hagenow, M; Gundrum, I; Hu, YH; Mutlu, B; Zinn, M; Gleicher, M; Radwin, RG",10.1177/00187208241272066
How does artificial intelligence impact employees' engagement in lean organisations?,"Driven by the digital transformation currently pursued by organisations, artificial intelligence (AI) applications have become more frequent. Nevertheless, its impact on employees' behaviors and attitudes is still poorly known. As employees' engagement (EE) is a key element for a successful Lean Production (LP) implementation, there is the need to understand such AI's implications on EE in this scenario. This paper aims to investigate the impact of AI on EE in lean organisations. We performed a qualitative-empirical approach in which we first interviewed twelve academic experts to grasp the investigated problem. Then, we conducted a multi-case study in manufacturing organisations undergoing a LP implementation to refine such understanding based on the observation of real-world evidence. Identifying commonalities between these stages allowed the formulation of propositions for future theory testing and validation. Findings indicate that AI may positively impact EE dimensions (physical, cognitive, and emotional) in human-centred work environments, such as lean organisations, although not at the same extent. Results also suggest that employees' psychological conditions (safety, meaningfulness, and availability) are positively affected by the relationship between AI and EE. The demystification of AI's effect on EE helps practitioners anticipate potential issues that can impair the LP implementation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.",Artificial intelligence; industry 4.0; lean production; employees' engagement; work environment; SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH,2024,Journal,"Tortorella, GL; Powell, D; Hines, P; Vergara, AM; Tlapa-Mendoza, D; Vassolo, R",10.1080/00207543.2024.2368698
Designing a medication timeline for patients and physicians,"Objective Most electronic health records display historical medication information only in a data table or clinician notes. We designed a medication timeline visualization intended to improve ease of use, speed, and accuracy in the ambulatory care of chronic disease. Materials and Methods We identified information needs for understanding a patient medication history, then applied human factors and interaction design principles to support that process. After research and analysis of existing medication lists and timelines to guide initial requirements, we hosted design workshops with multidisciplinary stakeholders to expand on our initial concepts. Subsequent core team meetings used an iterative user-centered design approach to refine our prototype. Finally, a small pilot evaluation of the design was conducted with practicing physicians. Results We propose an open-source online prototype that incorporates user feedback from initial design workshops, and broad multidisciplinary audience feedback. We describe the applicable design principles associated with each of the prototype's key features. A pilot evaluation of the design showed improved physician performance in 5 common medication-related tasks, compared to tabular presentation of the same information. Discussion There is industry interest in developing medication timelines based on the example prototype concepts. An open, standards-based technology platform could enable developers to create a medication timeline that could be deployable across any compatible health IT application. Conclusion The design goal was to improve physician understanding of a patient's complex medication history, using a medication timeline visualization. Such a design could reduce temporal and cognitive load on physicians for improved and safer care.",ambulatory care; chronic disease; cognition; computer graphics; electronic health record; human-computer interaction,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,2019,Journal,"Belden, JL; Wegier, P; Patel, J; Hutson, A; Plaisant, C; Moore, JL; Lowrance, NJ; Boren, SA; Koopman, RJ",10.1093/jamia/ocy143
In Search for Cognitive Hedonic Intelligent Patterns: Motor Interaction,"Designers and engineers face the challenge of creating varied objects to generate competitive interdependence also have to fulfill the purpose of creating a competitive advantage for the product during the process in order to analyze the qualities of an increasingly selective market sector. We aim to give a new vision to the university and the industry on how to conceive the design in our contemporary era by the use of hedonic design as a new field of research [5]. When consumers look for a product they try to satisfy their preferences in line with hedonism as a theory of welfare [6]. This theory recognizes that a need must be identified. However not all the products that satisfy our needs are capable of creating close ties with the consumers. From the cognitive ergonomic field as we take account we most understand the product in relationship with the user. This relationship is defined as static work systems and dynamic work systems. From those systems, we study the 5 levels of human interaction according to the reference frame of cognitive ergonomics [1].",Hedonic design; Cognitive hedonic patterns; Emotional ties; Human interaction,SMART TECHNOLOGY,2018,Conference,"Pineda, LO; Tejeda, JG; Aldana, SB",10.1007/978-3-319-73323-4_20
Incorporating the Effect of Physical Fatigue on Quality to Optimize Operator Work and Break Schedule,"In manual manufacturing systems, longer working hours lead to a higher physical fatigue level, which in turn brings a lower quality of the output. This paper examines the relationship between physical fatigue and quality, and then proposes a mathematical model to optimize work and break time based on the relationship. An experiment was conducted by asking a group of participants to perform a cognitive task at four levels of physical fatigue, measured by heart rate. Elevated heart rates were gained by riding a static bicycle. Experiment data showed a linear relationship between quality and physical fatigue. Then, we developed a mathematical model to optimize work and break schedule for operator, where the decision variable was the number of parts in the first run, and the objective function was the average total process time. The model worked properly and was effective to solve the optimization of work and break times. The model in this paper can be used by managers to optimize work and break times for operators. With data on operator fatigue and recovery rates, fatigue-to-quality constant and gradient, we developed a model for managers to determine work and break times to obtain optimal process and break times.",Physical Fatigue; Quality; Heart Rate; Cognitive Task; Work Scheduling,INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,2024,Journal,"Kurniawan, D; Febrianti, A",10.7232/iems.2024.23.2.112

Evaluation of Human-Robot Interaction Quality: A Toolkit for Workplace Design,"The working world is facing a constant change. New technologies emerge enabling new forms of human-system interactions. Especially autonomous robots in services industries as well as manufacturing settings create novel forms of human-robot interaction. Not only researchers but also system integrators as well as practitioners are confronted with the question how to analyze, to evaluate and finally how to design these new working systems in a human-centered way. In this paper we present evaluation criteria as well as a toolkit with concrete measures in order to enable a holistic evaluation of cognitive aspects in human-robot-interactions in work related scenarios. The evaluation criteria comprise technology and human related parameters. Further the paper presents a first empirical validation of the evaluation criteria and their measurements.

How Important Alarm Types for Situation Awareness at the Smart Factory?,"In recent years, manufacturing engineering has been changed rapidly through different parallel running developments. According to the needs of customers have become vary and the market has become being expanded through e-commerce development, manufacturers are willing to produce customized products globally, it induces a higher proliferation of variants, and shorter product life cycles. Endsley (2016) suggested that many systems involve various types of alarms or alerts function in order to call operators' attention to important information. In order to increase the operator's situation awareness, gathering and integrating all kinds of data from the machine are not sufficient. The system applied in the smart factory should involve the specific alarm system which analyses the cognitive processing of the operators, thus it should inform contexts of problems to operators effectively. In this paper, we more focus on designing and evaluating the alarm system, thus, how the system might have an effect on operators' situation awareness that researched in detail level.",Smart factory; Alarm system; Situation awareness,"HCI INTERNATIONAL 2019 - LATE BREAKING POSTERS, HCII 2019",2019,Conference,"Park, H; Park, D; Lee, J",10.1007/978-3-030-30712-7_15
Enabling green manufacturing using Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) technology,"This paper presents how to model and implement green planning approaches in manufacturing environments using Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) technology. The paper takes a starting point in a case study aiming to bring forward environmental impacts as a decision factor in production planning and control by enabling companies to pick a plan where environmental impact factors are integrated in the planning environment. The companies involved in the project arc two Danish process industries and manufacturer of mass customized products. Based on extensive data collection and developed simulation models, new methods of optimizing resources in the manufacturing are tested including factors such as machine allocation, batch sizes, sequences, and product mix. The tree main factors in assessing the environmental impact have been waste, energy, and emission. The latter has been calculated based on energy consumption and the type of energy source. Especially the need to involve human decision making to obtain a satisfactory plan, points towards Cogninive Infocommunication, mainly due to the complex nature of the production and supply chain planning that have proven difficult to model.","Green; Sustainability; Cognitive Infocommunication; Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS); Energy, Emission; Waste; Simulation; Manufacturing Planning and Control",2019 10TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE INFOCOMMUNICATIONS (COGINFOCOM 2019),2019,Conference,"Steger-Jensen, K; Hvolby, HH; Dukovska-Popovska, I; Vestergaard, S; Svensson, C",10.1109/coginfocom47531.2019.9089996

Interruptions in the wild: portraying the handling of interruptions in manufacturing from a distributed cognition lens,"This paper presents a study examining interruptions in the wild by portraying the handling of interruptions in manufacturing from a distributed cognition lens. By studying how interruptions occur and are handled in the daily activities of a work team at a large foundry for casting heavy diesel engines, we highlight situations when the propagation, transformation, and representation of information are not supported by prescribed work processes and propose recommendations for how this can be amended. The study was conducted by several visits to the aforementioned factory with cognitive ethnography as the basis for the data collection. The focus was on identifying interruptions and analysing these through a distributed cognition framework as an initial step towards studying interruptions in a manufacturing environment. The key findings include the identification of three, previously undefined, types of interruptions and the conclusion that interruptions do indeed affect the distributed workload of the socio-technical system and thus the overall production performance at the casting line.",Manufacturing; Interruptions; Distributed cognition; Cognitive ethnography,COGNITION TECHNOLOGY & WORK,2017,Journal,"Andreasson, R; Lindblom, J; Thorvald, P",10.1007/s10111-016-0399-6
Survey and Tutorial on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence,"The growing computing power, easy acquisition of large-scale data, and constantly improved algorithms have led to a new wave of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, which change the ways we live, manufacture, and do business. Along with this development, a rising concern is the relationship between AI and human intelligence, namely, whether AI systems may one day overtake, manipulate, or replace humans. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept named hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which fuses human abilities and AI capabilities into a unified entity. It presents a challenging yet promising research direction that prompts secure and trusted AI innovations while keeping humans in the loop for effective control. We scientifically define the concept of H-AI and propose an evolution road map for the development of AI toward H-AI. We then examine the key underpinning techniques of H-AI, such as user profile modeling, cognitive computing, and human-in-the-loop machine learning. Afterward, we discuss H-Al's potential applications in the area of smart homes, intelligent medicine, smart transportation, and smart manufacturing. Finally, we conduct a critical analysis of current challenges and open gaps in H-AI, upon which we elaborate on future research issues and directions.",Technological innovation; Roads; Human intelligence; Tutorials; Smart homes; Machine learning; Human in the loop; hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI); Internet of Things (IoT); artificial intelligence (AI),TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,2023,Journal,"Shi, FF; Zhou, F; Liu, H; Chen, LM; Ning, HS",10.26599/TST.2022.9010022
Cognitive Business Process Management for Adaptive Cyber-Physical Processes,"In the era of Big Data and Internet-of-Things (IoT), all real-world environments are gradually becoming cyber-physical (e.g., emergency management, healthcare, smart manufacturing, etc.), with the presence of connected devices and embedded ICT systems (e.g., smart-phones, sensors, actuators) producing huge amounts of data and events that influence the enactment of the Cyber Physical Processes (CPPs) enacted in such environments. A Process Management System (PMS) employed for executing CPPs is required to automatically adapt its running processes to anomalous situations and exogenous events by minimising any human intervention at run-time. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing an approach and an adaptive Cognitive PMS that combines process execution monitoring, unanticipated exception detection and automated resolution strategies leveraging on well-established action-based formalisms in Artificial Intelligence, which allow to interpret the ever-changing knowledge of cyber-physical environments and to adapt CPPs by preserving their base structure.",Cognitive business process management Cyber-Physical Processes; Process adaptation and recovery Situation calculus; IndiGolog; Automated planning,BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT WORKSHOPS (BPM 2017),2018,Conference,"Marrella, A; Mecella, M",10.1007/978-3-319-74030-0_33
Modulating Human Input for Shared Autonomy in Dynamic Environments,"Many robotic tasks require human interaction through teleoperation to achieve high performance. However, in industrial applications these methods often require high levels of concentration and manual dexterity leading to high cognitive loads and dangerous working conditions. Shared autonomy attempts to address these issues by blending human and autonomous reasoning, relieving the burden of precise motor control, tracking, and localization. In this paper we propose an optimization-based representation for shared autonomy in dynamic environments. We ensure real-time tractability by modulating the human input with the information of the changing environment in the same task space, instead of adding it to the optimization cost or constraints. We illustrate the method with two real world applications: grasping objects in a cluttered environment, and a spraying task requiring sprayed linings with greater homogeneity. Finally we use a 7 degree of freedom KUKA LWR arm to simulate the grasping and spraying experiments.",,2019 28TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOT AND HUMAN INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION (RO-MAN),2019,Conference,"Mower, CE; Moura, J; Davies, A; Vijayakumar, S",10.1109/ro-man46459.2019.8956304
The beginnings of tool innovation in human ontogeny: How three-to five-year-olds solve the vertical and horizontal tube task,"This study focuses on tool innovation in preschoolers. It extends previous work by investigating task- and age-related changes in success rates, latency to success, and solution strategies. Threeto five-year-olds had 10 min to retrieve a toy from either a horizontal or a vertical tube by manufacturing a tool from multiple materials. In the Horizontal Tube Task, success rates were high irrespective of age. Solution strategies revealed mainly second-order innovation (i.e., manipulating materials while retrieving the toy). In the Vertical Tube Task, success rates increased with age and solution strategies reflected mainly first-order innovation (i.e., manufacturing the tool before trying to retrieve the toy). In the Vertical Tube Task, children needed more time to find a solution, with first-order innovation tending to be faster than secondorder innovation. These findings demonstrate the potential of young preschoolers to innovate tools when given enough time, but also a high task-dependency of performance.",Tool innovation; Problem solving; Preschool children; Cognitive development,COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT,2021,Journal,"Breyel, S; Pauen, S",10.1016/j.cogdev.2021.101049
Design-as-a-Service Framework for Enabling Innovations in Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises,"Modern manufacturing enterprises must be agile to cope with sudden demand changes arising from increased global competition, geopolitical factors, and unforeseen circumstances such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector lack agility due to lower penetration of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), the inability to employ highly skilled human capital, and the absence of a formal innovation ecosystem for new products or solutions. In recent years, Cloud-based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM) has emerged as an enabler for product realization by integrating various service-based models. However, the existing framework does not thoroughly support the innovation ecosystem from concept to product realization by formally addressing economic challenges and human skillset requirements. The present work considers the augmentation of the Design-as-a-Service (DaaS) model into the existing CBDM framework for enabling systematic product innovations. The DaaS model proposes to connect skilled human resources with enterprises interested in transforming an idea into a product or solution through the CBDM framework. The model presents an approach for integrating human resources with various CBDM elements and end-users through a service-based model. The challenges associated with successfully implementing the proposed model are also discussed. It is established that the DaaS has the potential for rapid and economical product discovery and can be readily accessible to SMEs or independent individuals.",product design; CAD/CAM/CAE; innovations; service-oriented design; cloud-based design and manufacturing; cognitive-based design; collaborative design; computer-aided design; computer-aided engineering; product development,JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,2023,Journal,"Agarwal, A; Sorathiya, PC; Vaishnav, S; Desai, KA; Mears, L",10.1115/1.4056373
TUMA: Towards an Intelligent Tutoring System for Manual-Procedural Activities,"Many activities, such as learning a craft, involve learning how to manipulate physical objects by following a step-by-step procedure. In this paper we present our ongoing work on development of TUMA: an intelligent tutoring system for manual-procedural activities. We first introduce the notion of manual-procedural activity and then argue about the opportunities for creating intelligent tutors for manual-procedural activities. Such an intelligent tutoring system can be used in domains like teaching crafts, that involve acquiring cognitive knowledge along with specific motor skills. TUMA unifies the research from three different communities: intelligent tutoring systems, human motion tracking, and assistance systems for manual assembly in manufacturing. We describe the vision and the requirements of TUMA and its functional architecture inspired by high-level components of intelligent tutoring systems.

The HWID working group aims at establishing relationships between extensive empirical work-domain studies and HCI design. Secondly, it aims to develop a new and harmonized interdisciplinary framework for trans-mediated and smart work-places that addresses the core challenge: how do you take a balanced and holistic design approach to improve the work experience in the organization? It aims to engage with and learn from partners' research in different work domains when identifying key attributes in the effective trans-mediation of pervasive and smart technologies from one work domain to another.

"A relationship between bias, lean tools, and waste","Purpose This study aims to highlight the system-wide potential relationships between forms of human bias, selected Lean tools and types of waste in a manufacturing process. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal single-site ethnographic case study using digital processing to make a material receiving process Lean was adopted. An inherent knowledge process with internal stakeholders in a stimulated situation alongside process requirements was performed to achieve quality data collection. The results of the narrative analysis and process observation, combined with a literature review identified widely used Lean tools, wastes and biases that produced a model for the relationships. Findings The study established the relationships between bias, Lean tools and wastes which enabled 97.6% error reduction, improved on-time accounting and eliminated three working hours per day. These savings resulted in seven employees being redeployed to new areas with delivery time for products reduced by seven days. Research limitations/implications The single site case study with a supporting literature survey underpinning the model would benefit from testing the model in application to different industries and locations. Practical implications Application of the model can identify potential relationships between a group of human biases, 25 Lean tools and 10 types of wastes in Lean manufacturing processes that support decision makers and line managers in productivity improvement. The model can be used to identify potential relationships between forms of human biases, Lean tools and types of wastes in Lean manufacturing processes and take suitable remedial actions. The influence of biases and the model could be used as a basis to counter implementation barriers and reduce system-wide wastes. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that connects the cognitive perspectives of Lean business processes with waste production and human biases. As part of the process, a relationship model is derived.",Lean manufacturing; Process wastes; Bias; Human factors engineering; Production management,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEAN SIX SIGMA,2022,Journal,"Purushothaman, MB; Seadon, J; Moore, D",10.1108/IJLSS-03-2021-0045
What do human factors and ergonomics professionals value in research publications? Re-examining the research-practice gap,"The research-practice gap is of concern in human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) as there is a belief that HF/E research may not be making an impact on practice in the 'real world'. A potential issue is what researchers and practitioners perceive as important in HF/E journal articles as a primary means of conveying research findings to practitioners. This study examined the characteristics that make scientific journal articles appeal to HF/E researchers and practitioners using a web-based survey. HF/E researchers and practitioners were more similar than expected in judgements of important attributes and the selection of articles. Both practitioners and researchers considered practical significance to be more important than theoretical significance, in direct contrast to professionals from a related discipline - psychology. Well-written articles were appreciated across disciplines. The results signal a strong interest in practical applications in HF/E, but a relative lack of focus on development of theories that should be the basis for practical applications. Practitioner Summary: HF/E researchers and practitioners make similar choices of journal articles and view presentation quality and practical significance as high but theory as low in determining the impact of articles, indicating a smaller than expected research-practice gap and that HF/E should encourage stronger focus on theory to ensure its continuing development.",research-practice gap; research publications; human factors; ergonomics,ERGONOMICS,2014,Journal,"Chung, AZQ; Williamson, A; Shorrock, ST",10.1080/00140139.2014.894582
"How to Explain It to a Model Manager? A Qualitative User Study About Understandability, Trustworthiness, Actionability, and Action Efficacy","In the context of explainable AI (XAI), little research has been done to show how user role specific explanations look like. This research aims to find out the explanation needs for a user role called model manager, a user monitoring multiple AI-based systems for quality assurance in manufacturing. The question this research attempts to answer is what are the explainability needs of the model manager. By using a design analysis technique (task questions), a concept (UI mockup) was created in a controlled way. Additionally, a causal chain model was created and used as an assumed representation of the mental model for explanations. Furthermore, several options of confidence levels were explored. In a qualitative user study (cognitive walkthrough) with ten participants, it was investigated which explanations are needed to support understandability, trustworthiness, and actionability. The research concludes four findings: F1) A mental model for explanations is an effective way to identify uncertainty addressing explanation content that addresses target user group specific needs. F2) AI domain and application domain explanations are identified as new explanation categories. F3) show your work and singular explanations are identified as new explanation categories. F4) actionability is identified as a new explanation quality.",Human-centered AI; explainable AI; explainability; understandability; trustworthiness; actionability; mental model; qualitative user research; cognitive walkthrough; design analysis technique,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HCI, AI-HCI 2023, PT I",2023,Conference,"Degen, H; Budnik, C; Gross, R; Rothering, M",10.1007/978-3-031-35891-3_14
Research on Interface of Large-Scale Equipment Network Management System Based on User Experience,"This paper reports on an experimental study on interface design to measure the mechanism of user experience in large-scale equipment network management system. Based on human factors and cognitive psychology theory, we conducted a comparative research study. Prototypes of the interface were designed based on the two types of information layout which were undergoing 5-point Likert questionnaire method to evaluation the user experience of the users. The main findings of this study were as follows: (1) we found that the interface improvement before (material A) and improved interface (material B) had significant differences on user experience in each level; (2) the improved interface (material B) has a significant better effect on user experience compare to improvement interface before (material A) (P < 0.05).

Human Factors Engineering at Design Stage: Is There a Need for More Structured Guidelines and Standards?,"Human Factors Engineering (HFE) focuses on the application of human factors knowledge to the design and construction of socio-technical systems. The objective is to ensure systems are designed so as to optimise the human contribution to production and minimise potential for design-induced risks to health, personal or process safety or environmental performance (OGP, 2011). The ISO standard ISO 9241-210 (2010), Ergonomics of human-system interaction, requires that all new facilities projects apply the principles of Human Factors Engineering (HFE) during early design stages. In practice this means ensuring, as a minimum, that every new facilities project is screened in collaboration with the end users to identify whether there are any hotspots (risks, issues or opportunities) associated with the scope of the design project that justify further HFE activities. Further standards detail these activities, including physical and cognitive ergonomic assessments of the operator tasks, the equipment they will use to complete those tasks, and the environment in which they will be undertaken. However, the standards need to be generic enough so as to avoid being tailored to any specific design process; this in turns generates a need for more specific guidance on different processes and activities supporting a more holistic approach to guide Designers, Operators, Risk Assessors and Project Planners at design stage. This guidance should help stakeholders identify and recognise the value of Human Factors Engineering considerations to optimise and guide some of the solutions devised in the early stages. Such an approach should help avoid more costly intervention later on in the lifecycle of the product or plant being designed and the possibility of undesired events related to miss-conceived Human Machine Interactions. There is often a need to demonstrate that this small initial investment in engineering to consider Human Factors aspects can result in a major reduction in the operational life-cycle costs and improvement in the conditions at work. However, this is often only demonstrated retrospectively after minor or major accidents. Strong operational performance can only start with good design and an understanding of what constitutes good design requires a detailed knowledge of how humans interact within the work system. The problem is whether the currently available standards and guidelines of the process industry provide sufficient guidance for a framework to be practically used by process engineers, discipline engineers, human factors engineers, ergonomists, project management and operational/maintenance line management during decisions to be made in preparation and execution of projects? This paper will start by observing and analysing the problem and presenting examples. The study will be continued by discussing what is currently available and performing a small gap analysis against concrete needs of case studies taken from the industry. Addressing those gaps will be within the scope of future research.",,CISAP6: 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SAFETY & ENVIRONMENT IN PROCESS & POWER INDUSTRY,2014,Conference,"Naghdali, F; Leva, MC; Balfe, N; Cromie, S",10.3303/CET1436097
Evaluating human error probability in maintenance task: An integrated system dynamics and machine learning approach,"Human error is often implicated in industrial accidents and is frequently found to be a symptom of broader issues within the sociotechnical system. Therefore, research exploring human error during maintenance activities is important. This article aims to assess the probability of human error in maintenance tasks at a cement factory using the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method and System Dynamics modeling. Given that human error probability (HEP) is influenced by various common performance conditions (CPCs) and their sub-factors, and changes dynamically in response to other variables, the SD method offers a practical approach for estimating and predicting human error behavior over time. This study identifies and quantifies the variables affecting HEP, explores their interactions and feedback in maintenance tasks, and assesses the associated costs. The machine learning technique is then used to estimate the relationship between HEP and these costs. The optimal value of the HEP function, 0.000772, is determined by identifying the minimum point of a cubic function, thereby minimizing associated costs and occupational accidents. Determining the optimal HEP is crucial for minimizing excessive costs and investing in improved ergonomics and CPCs for better performance. This addresses a significant gap in existing research where the impact of human error on maintenance tasks has not been estimated as a function. Furthermore, three scenarios are presented to help managers allocate the organization's budget more effectively.",cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM); human error probability (HEP); machine learning (ML); maintenance; system dynamics (SD),HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS IN MANUFACTURING & SERVICE INDUSTRIES,2024,Journal,"Emroozi, VB; Kazemi, M; Pooya, A; Doostparast, M",10.1002/hfm.21057
A multiobjective decision-making approach for modelling and planning economically and environmentally sustainable robotic disassembly for remanufacturing,"Adopting initiatives to extend the useful life of products or recovering their components for reuse, remanufacturing or recycling is a key issue in the attempt to protect the environment and minimise the demand for natural resources. To contribute to the performance of automated disassembly practices, this paper presents a multiobjective decision-making approach based on the optimisation of three goals in a robotic disassembly cell framework: enhancing the economic performance of the process, reducing energy consumption and mitigating the environmental impact. Two real-use cases are presented as demonstrators, supported by appropriate, updated information from industry. The design model allowed the authors to obtain the best robotic disassembly sequence plan, the correct disassembly direction, the best recovery option for the disassembled components - reuse, remanufacturing, recycling or disposal - and the most appropriate disassembly tools, finding the optimal or near-optimal solution that best balances the three sustainability goals. An Enhanced Discrete Bees Algorithm with a mutation operator was employed to find the solution for the optimisation. Moreover, a multiobjective Bees Algorithm, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and a Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm II were adopted to solve the multiobjective optimisation problem using different iteration numbers and population sizes. The results provide insights into robotic disassembly processes, encouraging firms to adopt more automated and sustainable remanufacturing strategies.",End-of-life; Remanufacturing; Disassembly sequence planning; Robotic disassembly; Multiobjective optimisation; Recovery option,COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,2023,Journal,"Hartono, N; Ramírez, FJ; Pham, DT",10.1016/j.cie.2023.109535
Integrating Sports Psychology into a human factors framework,"The emergence of cross-disciplinary research among the many sub disciplines of psychology is an encouraging trend. In sports psychology alone, the discoveries made in areas such as stress and performance, emotional and cognitive states, and situations could be of immense use to teams in both military and industrial contexts. However, while an abundance of work is being done on sports, sports teams, and teamwork, an integrative framework for this plethora of research is missing. We suggest that one of the greatest contributions that human factors research could provide to sports psychology is such an integrative theoretical framework. Therefore, after defining the key constructs used in this paper, we present the Input-Process-Emergent States-Outcome model. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this model, we provide examples of research from sports psychology.",Coordination; Implicit coordination; Teams; Team cognition; Team work,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT PSYCHOLOGY,2016,Journal,"Reynolds, R; Salas, E",10.7352/IJSP.2016.47.224
Cognitive biases that influence Lean implementation and practices in a multicultural environment,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to highlight the prominent cognitive biases that influence Lean practices in organisations that have a multi-cultural work environment which will aid the organisational managers and academics in enhancing the understanding of the human thought process and mitigate them suitably. Design/methodology/approachA multiple case study was conducted in organisations that were previously committed to Lean practices and had a multi-cultural work environment. This research was conducted on five companies based on 99 in-depth semi-structured interviews and seven process observations that sought to establish the system-wide cognitive biases present in a multi-cultural Lean environment. FindingsThe novel findings indicate that nine new biases influence Lean implementation and practices in a multi-cultural environment. This study also found strong connectivity between Lean practices and 45 previously identified biases that could affect positively or negatively the lean methodologies and their implementation. Biases were resilient enough that their influence on Lean in multi-cultural workplaces, even with transient populations, did not demonstrate cultural differentiation. Research limitations/implicationsLike any qualitative research, constructivism and narrative analyses are subjected to understanding based on knowledge gained on the subject, and data may have been interpreted differently. Constructivist co-recreation of process scenarios based result limitations is therefore acknowledged. The interactive participation in exploring the knowledge sought after and interaction that could have a probable influence on the participant need to be acknowledged. However, the research design, multiple methods of data collection, generalisation based on data collection and analysis methods limit the effects of these and findings are reliable to a greater extent. Practical implicationsThe results can provide an enhanced understanding of biases and insights into a new managerial approach to take remedial steps on biases' influence on Lean practices that can result in improved productivity and well-being from a business process perspective. Understanding and mitigating the prominent biases can aid Lean manufacturing processes and support decision makers and line managers in improving lean methodologies' effectiveness and productivity. The biases can be negated and used to implement decisions with ease. The influence of biases and the model could be used as a basis to counter implementation barriers. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that connects the cognitive perspectives of Lean business processes in a multi-cultural environment to identify the cognitive biases that influence Lean practices in organisations that were previously committed to Lean practices. The novel findings indicate that nine new biases and 45 previously identified biases influence Lean implementation and practices in a multi-cultural environment. The second novelty of this study shows the connection between cognitive biases, Lean implementation and practices in multi-cultural business processes.",Lean manufacturing; Human barriers; Cognitive bias; Bias; Lean,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEAN SIX SIGMA,2023,Journal,"Babu, PM; Seadon, J; Moore, D",10.1108/IJLSS-10-2022-0218
"Lithic Technology and Origin of the Stone Raw Material from the Guenfouda Cave (Jerada Province, Eastern Morocco)","The Guenfouda cave is located 30 km south of the city of Oujda in the Jbel Metssila belonging to the Oujda Mountains. It was recognized as a site of archaeological interest in 2003. Excavations are scheduled every year, and important archaeological material (lithic, faunal and human) has been brought to light. A first study on the lithic industry was carried out by S. Almisas and M. Souhir [2018] under the title of New studies on the lithic industry of the Neolithic deposits of the Oujda Mountains. Raw material and technology [Reg.03 Upper Pleistocene and Holocene cognitive complexity & archaeogenetics in North Africa 15th PANAF Conference, Rabat 2018]. The study is based on technological techniques, the typology of cut products and also on the origin of the raw material used. The lithic industry is abundant, well preserved in all levels and phases of the operating chain are present, indicating debitage in situ in the cave. The artefacts are brought back to the Neolithic for the upper levels, then to the final Upper Paleolithic (or Epipaleolithic) for the lower levels, marked by a change in culture with the ap- pearance of back-to-body lamellae. The first analyses of the raw material used by prehistoric man in this cave, in particular the flint, generally comes from the Swimina area, located to the south of the Oued El Hay basin (Ain Beni Mathar). The limestones come from the surroundings of the mountains of 'Oujda, plains and wadis. As for the basalt, it comes from an ancient Quaternary volcano located near the cave at the top of Jebel Metssila. In turn, quartzites, phtanites, silicified green schist and tuffite, they come from the Paleozoic buttonholes of Glib Naam and jbel boussofane (Province of Jerada). Given the information above, it appears that the man from Guenfouda may have used various rocks for the manufacturing of tools, and would have traveled distances of up to 60 km in radius to stock up on raw material, especially flint.",Guenfouda; Prehistoric cave; Oujda mountains; Eastern Morocco; Neolithic; Upper Paleolithic; raw material origin,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,2021,Journal,"Souhir, M; Cruz, SA; Aouraghe, H; Mhamdi, H",10.12911/22998993/140373
Usability is more valuable predictor than product personality for product choice in human-product physical interaction,"Product personality and product usability are two important factors which can influence consumers' product choice. Published literature are available regarding independent impact of product personality and product usability on product choice but no research has been reported so far for understanding their collective influence on product choice. In addition, which factor between usability and product personality contributing more in product choice is still not clear. Current research thus aimed to bridge these research gaps by establishing inter-relationships among product personality, usability and product choice. To achieve this goal, two separate experiments were conducted. Results of first experiment revealed that products having high product usability also possessed strong product personality. Following second experiment, it was observed that solitary influence of product usability on product choice was more than the standalone influence of product personality in human-product physical interaction. Moreover, it unfolded the fact that product usability mediates the influence of product personality towards product choice. Established interrelationships among product personality, usability and product choice, would help designer and ergonomists to decide how product attributes could be manipulated to enhance product personality and/or product usability to ensure product choice. Relevance to industry: Techniques mentioned in the current paper for product usability/personality assessment, have significant implication in product design. Gained knowledge will be helpful for industrial designer or human factors experts to incorporate various positive product usability attributes to enhance product personality or vice-versa for assuring acceptance of product in market.

Investigation of Human Factors Using HFACS Framework-A Case Study for Unintended Reactor Trip Events in NPP,"Safety remains to be the principal concern in nuclear industry, and layered protective measures are implemented to ensure safety to public and environment. Nevertheless, accidents in a nuclear plant do occur, and human factors are confirmed to be the prime cause of these accidents. Several studies have been carried out for human factor analysis, and still, there is a need for additional methods to model human errors. In this paper, human factor analysis and classification system (HFACS) is used to analyze the causal factors for an accident/incident. HFACS is a validated and reliable model for human factor analysis and provides a simple way to evaluate the causal factors in an accident. Although HFACS framework can be applied to analyze any accident events, in this paper, it is applied to review eighteen unintended reactor trip events due to human error from 2000 to 2006. In this study, experts analyze and rate the events against each hierarchal level in HFACS. Expert judgment is sought as the uncertainty and complexity involved in modeling human and organizational factors are very high. Homogeneity of experts is assessed using inter-rated reliability and Cohen's kappa value. Expert evaluation on human factors is quantified and based on the correlation in rating, most significant factor is identified. Further, based on the information on the reported events and the analysis, statistical tests are employed to confirm the associations between the hierarchal levels in the HFACS framework for reactor trip events. The results indicate four pairs of factors, viz. resource management, planned inappropriate actions, adverse mental states, and skill-based errors have strong associations between adjacent categories. Based on these associations, adverse mental states are deemed the most potent for accident occurrences. Further analysis indicated that slips of attention, memory failures for events such a failure to open or close the valves, and perception failures for visual illumination (i.e., 'skilled based errors') are the most common 'unsafe acts' committed and appear more frequently along with nuclear control room actions. The results reveal that human errors are caused mainly due to potential human factors associated with cognition. Few active failures are also identified. Thus, the analysis highlights the importance of attention toward possible human factors among others. Overall, HFACS tool proves useful in categorizing operator errors from reported events. HFACS framework and the quantification method help to determine which factors are more dominant and influential in the accident sequence and provide additional insight for the analysts into the significance and relative importance of each of the human factors.",Cognitive factor; Human error identification; Human factor analysis and classification systems; Reliability measurement; Reactor trip event,"RELIABILITY, SAFETY AND HAZARD ASSESSMENT FOR RISK-BASED TECHNOLOGIES",2020,Conference,"Karthick, M; Kumar, CS; Robert, TP",10.1007/978-981-13-9008-1_65
Brain-inspired Intelligent Robotics: Theoretical Analysis and Systematic Application,"Traditional joint-link robots have been widely used in production lines because of their high precision for single tasks. With the development of the manufacturing and service industries, the requirement for the comprehensive performance of robotics is growing. Numerous types of bio-inspired robotics have been investigated to realize human-like motion control and manipulation. A study route from inner mechanisms to external structures is proposed to imitate humans and animals better. With this idea, a brain-inspired intelligent robotic system is constructed that contains visual cognition, decision-making, motion control, and musculoskeletal structures. This paper reviews cutting-edge research in brain-inspired visual cognition, decision-making, motion control, and musculoskeletal systems.

Embodying Intelligence: Humanoid Robot Advancements and Future Prospects,"In an era of technological advancements, there are multiple stratagems to remain relevant and be one step ahead of the others in the same field. Exploring the convergence of humanoid artificial intelligence, the communities of Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence of Things, and the Machine Learners align their goals into integrating both physical and virtual worlds which opens a lot of opportunity in human and robot interaction. Anthropomorphic robots are built with the grandiose objective of emulating human form and function, serving an extensive spectrum of purposes in a variety of industries and applications. Its utility encompasses nearly everything from assistance and companionship to industrial and recreational applications. Humanoid devices are capable of being an aid in the realm of healthcare such as therapeutic activities, featuring tailored care and support towards people experiencing physical constraints or impairments. These robots can undertake difficult endeavors with dexterity in the manufacturing process, enhancing efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize education by functioning as interactive instructors as well as companions for people who are subjected to difficulties with learning. These robotics' potential goes further towards responding to catastrophic instances, where its handiness and versatility allow it to venture into complicated areas, analyze factors, and conduct operations that humans may deem hazardous. Artificially intelligent humanoids ought to be able to consistently acquire knowledge and adjust to shifting circumstances. This implies utilizing reinforcement learning to improve performance and responsiveness over time by refining its actions. Anthropoid robots' adaptability markets them as vital instruments with a likelihood to augment human abilities as they confront a multitude of challenges across various domains. These humanoid robots are designed to take the form and function of a human thus serving as the physical embodiment of adaptable intelligent systems. The cognitive abilities and adaptive learning of a humanoid robot are to be explained in this paper, as well as the intricate details of how machine learning techniques influence the robots' capacity to learn from experiences and dynamically respond to perplexing surroundings. As technology progresses, the attempt to create increasingly accurate humanoid robots propels the boundaries of what is plausible, establishing not only an insight into the future but also a mirror of the nuances that constitute our own humanity. Constructing a humanoid robot that is capable of functioning as a human necessitates working with a complex web of aspects involving mechanics, artificial intelligence, and neurological mechanisms. In order to accomplish a robot that resembles anthropomorphic movement, a proficient mechanical craftsmanship must be developed. Humanoid robots must replicate the human body's versatility in motion, mobility of joints, and precision. The aforementioned entails using cutting-edge materials and exquisite engineering to simulate the subtleties of human freedom of movement, spanning delicate motor ability to seamless propulsion. For a humanoid robot to navigate and interact with its environment, advanced sensory mechanisms must be integrated. Furthermore, not only its vision equipment should perceive surroundings, whereas it must also recognize imagery and depth perception. Sensors that measure tactile sensations convey signals for sensitive interactions and object maneuvering by portraying the human sense of contact. For the purpose of allowing accurate movement coordination, kinesthesia is adapted. In imitation of human cognitive functions, human-like robots depend on advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. This comprehensive abstract offers a wide-ranging overview of the present state and future possibilities of humanoid robots. It emerges into the tremendous mechanical capabilities, revolutionary intellectual developments, interaction between humans and robots' dynamics, and the stimulating perspectives that stretch beyond. Humanoid robots, as an embodiment of intelligence, occupy a key position where technology progress meets societal development. The subject matter is an immersion account about humanity's ongoing attempt at developing intelligent devices that precisely replicate while gaining insight on the complexities of human existence. The futuristic frontiers of humanoid robotics are to be explored throughout the study, envisioning a world in which these machines serve critical roles in the fields of space exploration, healthcare, education, and several other fields. Humanoid robots, as technology improves, possess the ability to revolutionize our view of human and machine interdependence, not solely as tools, but as essential contributors to our society. This concept probes into the terrain of collaborative robotics, focusing on the synergistic interaction that exists between mankind and humanoid robots. This relationship includes more than just physical assistance; it also includes an integrated intellect that boosts innovative thinking, troubleshooting, and effectiveness. The prospective societal impact of humanoid robots in harmonious roles reckon a more secure work environment, improved output, and job role reconfiguration in an array of industries. In the department of Artificial Intelligence of Things, humanoid robots serve as autonomous components, traversing real world settings while interfacing networks. The ability of these machines to process real-time data, interpret environmental cues, and communicate with other IoT devices, alongside improving linked system performance, also incorporates a more unified and responsive IoT community. Concurrently, humanoid robots also act as digital characters, embodying individuals in virtual places, bridging the gap between actual existence and the Metaverse. Such physicality offers a newchannel for immersive interactions, permitting users to gain access to the Metaverse bymeans of the eyes of humanoid substitutes, facilitating a more cohesive consolidation of physical and virtual realities.",Humanoid robot; Advanced technologies; Artificial intelligence; Robot and AI synergy; Anthropomorphic robot; Human robot interaction,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HCI, PT III, AI-HCI 2024",2024,Conference,"Valenzuela, KL; Roxas, SI; Wong, YH",10.1007/978-3-031-60615-1_20
How does the application of augmented reality affect the mental workload of human workers? A collection of preliminary results,"Digitalisation and the introduction of smart manufacturing technologies are changing the shape of industrial shop floors. For manufacturing companies, it becomes imperative to assess the operational and economic advantages derived from these technologies. Simultaneously, in alignment with the Industry 5.0 paradigm, understanding the influence of digital technologies on human workers, especially those directly interacting with these technologies, is equally critical. This study focuses on augmented reality (AR) as a specific technology, conducting an experimental campaign to explore its effects on learning curves and cognitive workload. Voluntary participants engaged in learning manual tasks of varying durations and required dexterity. This study evaluates the impact of AR on the mental workload of operators, utilising two main eye-related measures: fixation duration and pupil diameter. Preliminary results indicate that augmented reality increases the cognitive workload of workers undergoing training.","['augmented reality', 'Industry 5.0', 'mental workload', 'digitalisation', 'eye tracking']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2024,Journal,"['Maretto, Leonardo', 'Battini, Daria', 'Faccio, Maurizio', 'Granata, Irene', 'Jaber, Mohamad Y.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2024.09.210
Capturing the system requirements for adopting Industry 5.0 in quality inspection: an evidence-based approach,"Manufacturers face the challenge of adopting digital solutions to maintain competitiveness in the era of flexible manufacturing. The human remains a crucial asset in ensuring this flexibility. Industry 5.0 strongly emphasizes human-centric approaches to achieve sustainability and resilience in the industry. Notably, in-line quality inspection stands out among the assembly operations to minimize waste and ensure quality. With the increasing trend toward high-mix low-volume manufacturing, the reliance on operators’ traditional tools and cognitive skills for quality inspections is no longer sufficient. Complexity escalates when manual assemblies involve components of varying sizes. Technologies such as augmented reality and computer vision can potentially support quality inspection in manual assembly. However, successful implementation depends on comprehending the specific requirements of the end users. We propose a qualitative approach to refining the requirements in applied research projects that aim to implement human-centered technologies. The approach was applied in a research project for in-line quality inspection with 18 professionals from two manufacturing companies. We instantiated the method using qualitative methods including questionnaires and focus groups with diverse stakeholders with demonstrations. We further investigated the verification and implementation of our method.","['Manual assembly', 'quality inspection', 'human-centered design', 'Industry 5.0']",Procedia CIRP,2024,Journal,"['Solmaz, Serkan', 'Henderickx, Rik', 'den Bergh, Jan Van', 'Birem, Merwan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2024.03.016
"Danger, high voltage! Using EEG and EOG measurements for cognitive overload detection in a simulated industrial context","Industrial settings will be characterized by far-reaching production automation brought about by advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, human assembly workers will need to adapt quickly to new and more complex assembly procedures, which are most likely to increase cognitive workload, or potentially induce overload. Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workers’ cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload.","['Industrial setting', 'Assembly task', 'Cognitive workload', 'Cognitive ergonomics', 'Overload', 'EEG', 'EOG']",Applied Ergonomics,2022,Journal,"['Morton, Jessica', 'Zheleva, Aleksandra', 'Van Acker, Bram B.', 'Durnez, Wouter', 'Vanneste, Pieter', 'Larmuseau, Charlotte', 'De Bruyne, Jonas', 'Raes, Annelies', 'Cornillie, Frederik', 'Saldien, Jelle', 'De Marez, Lieven', 'Bombeke, Klaas']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103763
Using gesture and speech communication modalities for safe human-drone interaction in construction,"Drones are increasingly being used in the construction industry for numerous applications. However, their presence poses safety risks to construction workers who work around them but have limited control and information about these drones. To ensure safety, general construction workers who are not part of the pilot teams should also be able to communicate their concerns with drones effectively and naturally. Despite its importance, research on human-drone communication within construction for non-operator workers is scarce. This study developed and evaluated communication protocols using gesture and speech modalities to ensure safe human-drone interactions for non-operator workers in construction environments. An immersive VR environment replicating construction site dynamics was developed, enabling workers to utilize gesture or speech communication protocols while working with drones. A total of 100 participants were recruited for the user-centered study analysis on an immersive VR construction site, and the safety implications and cognitive loads of both protocols were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that gesture-based communication is more effective than speech-based communication in mitigating risks and alleviating the negative impacts of drones without imposing additional cognitive strain on users on construction sites.","['Human-Drone Interaction', 'Gesture', 'Speech', 'Virtual Reality (VR)', 'Safety', 'Drone', 'Construction']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2024,Journal,"['Zhu, Zixian', 'Cheng, Jiun-Yao', 'Jeelani, Idris', 'Gheisari, Masoud']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2024.102827
Evaluating visual encoding quality of a mixed reality user interface for human–machine co-assembly in complex operational terrain,"During human–machine collaboration in manufacturing activities, it is important to provide real-time annotations in the three-dimensional workspace for local workers who may lack relevant experience and knowledge. For example, in MR assembly, workers need to be alerted to avoid entering hazardous areas when manually replacing components. Recently, many researchers have explored various visual cues for expressing physical task progress information in the MR interface of intelligent systems. However, the relationship between the implantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D reconstruction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably.","['Visual encoding', 'Mixed reality', 'User interface', 'Co-assembly', 'Complex operational terrain']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2023,Journal,"['Wang, Zhuo', 'Zhang, Xiangyu', 'Li, Liang', 'Zhou, Yiliang', 'Lu, Zexin', 'Dai, Yuwei', 'Liu, Chaoqian', 'Su, Zekun', 'Bai, Xiaoliang', 'Billinghurst, Mark']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2023.102171
Using action research to develop human factors approaches to improve assembly quality during early design and ramp-up of an assembly line,"Engineers at a large electronics new product initiation site were interested in developing human factors (HF) approaches to help improve assembly quality during two stages of their production assembly design: early design of tasks, fixtures and tooling; and during early ramp-up of new assembly lines at outsourcing sites. Researchers worked in an action research approach with company engineers and ergonomists to integrate HF into both design stages. This paper presents the human factors approaches and discusses the challenges of using human factors to improve assembly quality. For the first stage of early design, a HF-design for assembly (HF-DFA) scorecard was developed with 22 items scored on a 0 (no risk or problem) to 2 (high risk or problems) scale. Items included physical risks, such as grip size and force, movement risks, such as re-grasping or re-orienting, visual risks, such as visual accuracy and inspection difficulty, and cognitive issues such as ability to detect a problem and risk of damage to part or component. High scores were associated with assembly tasks that were both reported as difficult by operators, and also had quality problems. The HF-DFA was adopted as a controlled engineering document and used to proactively score assembly tasks prior to final design of tasks, fixtures and tooling. In the second stage of early ramp, researchers combined the HF-DFA and other HF and performance-based metrics into a modified HF-house of quality (HF-HoQ) approach where the focus was on “worker” requirements rather than the traditional customer requirements. The HF-HoQ was evaluated using video of four identical tasks performed at different outsourcing locations that had a seven-fold difference in defect rates. The HF-HoQ successfully detected the site with the highest defect rate, but not the lowest. The authors recommend further testing and development of approaches that attempt to bring insight from HF to the issue of improving assembly quality. Relevance to industry Human factors is broader than injury prevention, and has been linked to assembly quality. Two HF approaches were developed to help improve quality in early design stages and during early ramp-up of assembly lines. Companies are encouraged to develop and evaluate HF approaches for improving assembly quality.","['Human factors', 'Ergonomics', 'Production assembly design', 'Quality improvement', 'Design for assembly', 'House of quality']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2017,Journal,"['Village, J.', 'Salustri, F.A.', 'Neumann, W.P.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2017.05.006
Manufacturing assembly serial and cells layouts impact on rest breaks and workers’ health,"Rest breaks are necessary for workers to avoid and/or recover from overall fatigue and to preserve their health. The type of assembly layout, either in lines or in cells, is a determining factor for organizing work at manufacturing companies, and it could also influence workers' work break and microbreak times. This study aimed at evaluating rest breaks in serial and cell assembly layout configurations as well as the layout's influence on workers' health. One hundred and twenty workers from a large automobile industry, divided into two groups (series and cells), were measured for their cycle-times and break times through biomechanical exposure analysis and questionnaires to evaluate the behaviors, physical, cognitive, and mental health. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify the distribution of the data with a significance level of p < 0.05. The cell assembly-line layouts had the greatest cycle-time and break time, and the workers had a higher level of physical activity (p < 0.05). The serial assembly-line layouts did not generate major occupational risk, need for rest, reduced capacity for work, or higher levels of stress for the workers. The production layouts differed in relation to the cycle-times for just-in-time manufacturing, but there was no difference in relation to the production demands and to the workers' health. Relevance to industry When taken at appropriate times, rest breaks in the workplace can improve workers’ overall health and productive performance, which reduces healthcare costs and improves industrial productivity.","['Ergonomics', 'Lean production', 'Occupational health', 'Design of systems']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2019,Journal,"['de Negreiros, Alexandher Weslley F.T.R.W.', 'Rodrigues da Silva, Patrícia', 'Arezes, Pedro Miguel Ferreira Martins', 'Dangelino, Roberta', 'Padula, Rosimeire Simprini']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2019.01.005
Exploring the Effects of Industry 4.0/5.0 on Human Factors: A Preliminary Systematic Literature Review,"Industry 5.0, built on the foundation of Industry 4.0, aims to integrate human capabilities and principles for a sustainable and human-centric industrial paradigm. This article proposes a systematic literature review to explore the empirical effects of Industry 4.0/5.0 (I4.0/5.0) technologies on human factors, emphasizing the often overlooked physical, psychological, and cognitive dimensions. The methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, involved a Scopus search spanning from 2005-2023, ultimately resulting in a selection of 15 articles. The preliminary results depict the studied I4.0/5.0 technologies and their impact on workers’ physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects. Some (I4.0/5.0) technologies received significant attention, such as human-robot communication and human-robot interaction, while others remain understudied.

Supervised stowing as enabling technology for the integration of impaired operators in the industry,"Nowadays, the number of jobs accessible to impaired people in industries is limited. However, minimum changes in the plant could allow the employment of such individuals. Technology is the way to assist such workers to perform at the best they could and to avoid disabilities to limit their potentialities. This work proposes a supervised stowing system that will allow impaired operators to perform the task of order-picking in cluttered environments, despite their disabilities. Pick and place is the most repetitive and common task in industrial manufacturing and warehouses, requiring complex cognitive skills for robots. In the proposed system, the task is physically executed by a robot, while the mental process of selecting the correct object to pick is demanded to the operator. This action is performed through an easy to use graphical user interface. An experimental campaign has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed assistive robotic system.","['Industrial robotics', 'Robotic picking', 'Universal Jamming Gripper', 'Computer Vision', 'ROS', 'Enabling technology']",Procedia Manufacturing,2020,Journal,"['D’Avella, Salvatore', 'Tripicchio, Paolo']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.10.025
Assessing user performance in augmented reality assembly guidance for industry 4.0 operators,"In the realm of smart manufacturing, Augmented Reality (AR) technology has gained increasing attention among researchers and manufacturers due to its practicality and adaptability. For this reason, it has been widely embraced in various industrial fields, especially for helping operators assemble products. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a debate in the research community about how effective AR is for improving user performance in assembly tasks, particularly when using handheld devices. These disparities can be attributed to differences in experimental approaches, such as the frequent use of qualitative methods, the inclusion of non-representative users, and the limited number of comprehensive case studies. In response to this, the paper delved into the benefits of AR applications, with a specific focus on measuring user performance and the cognitive workload perceived by users during assembly activities. To this end, an AR assembly guidance tool has been developed to assist users during assembly tasks, running on a mobile device, specifically a tablet, for freedom of movement and high portability. Experimentation involved the assembly of a comprehensive case study and a diverse user group, allowing the comparison representative users and experienced industrial operators. The results were promising, indicating that AR technology effectively enhances user performance during assembly-guided activities compared to conventional methods, particularly when users are unfamiliar with the task at hand. This study brings valuable insights by addressing previous research limitations and providing strong evidence of AR's positive impact on user performance in real-world assembly scenarios.","['Augmented Reality', 'Industry 4.0', 'Assembly guidance', 'Hand-held devices', 'User performance', 'AR Foundation']",Computers in Industry,2024,Journal,"['Marino, Emanuele', 'Barbieri, Loris', 'Bruno, Fabio', 'Muzzupappa, Maurizio']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2024.104085
Exploration of digitalized presentation of information for Operator 4.0: Five industrial cases,"In the digital transformation of manufacturing companies towards Industry 4.0, shop-floor operators of the future, Operator 4.0, will require digitalized presentation of information as cognitive support for their work. This paper explores five industrial cases where Information Support Technology have been conceptualized and developed. These cases have exemplified how digitalized presentation of information can be approached with considerations of operators with varying cognitive work situations and production characteristics. Furthermore, these new technical capabilities have increased the level of cognitive automation to support operators’ individual abilities to perform their work in an increasingly more complex production environment. In conclusion, Information Support Technology in the service of Operator 4.0 is intimately linked with digitalization strategies for transformation towards Industry 4.0.","['Industry 4.0', 'Operator 4.0', 'Information Support Technology', 'Digitalization', 'Information', 'Manufacturing']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,"['Li, Dan', 'Fast-Berglund, Åsa', 'Paulin, Dan', 'Thorvald, Peter']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.108048
Remarks from an experimental study on human-robot collaborative assembly,"Human robot collaboration is becoming the norm in the workplace, due to the benefits robots can bring to efficiency and production. However, this creates highly complex and dynamic workplaces that human operators need to adapt to. Industry 5.0 promotes the use of robotics and smart technologies in a more human-centric way. However, research on how operators are affected by those changes is needed to better understand how to move towards human-centricity. As such, an experimental study was designed and performed on human robot collaborative assembly. The main aim was to investigate the correlation between cognitive load and quality due to collaboration. Here, the preliminary results of the experimental study are presented in order to remark relevant states influencing work allocation. The results showcased the need for better training and more knowledge for the operators, as well as involving operators in process and workplace design. This study helps contribute knowledge on robot implementation and process design for human robot collaboration for both researchers and operations management, as it showcases the need to involve operators in those steps due to the feedback they can provide due to their experience.","['human-robot', 'sociotechnical system', 'collaborative assembly', 'experimental study', 'design']",Procedia Computer Science,2024,Journal,"['Panagou, Sotirios', 'Neumann, W.

Software framework concept with visual programming and digital twin for intuitive process creation with multiple robotic systems,"With the progressive digitalization in industrial manufacturing, the usage of complex robotic systems in both intralogistics and production is expected to increase. This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program-synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the programming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in parallel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software.","['Smart Manufacturing', 'Programming', 'Industry 4.0', 'Operator 4.0', 'Human Robot Interaction', 'Process Planning', 'User Centric Design', 'Human-machine interaction', 'Software architecture', 'Visual programming', 'Digital twin']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,"['Niermann, Dario', 'Doernbach, Tobias', 'Petzoldt, Christoph', 'Isken, Melvin', 'Freitag, Michael']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102536
Study of the impact of projection-based assistance systems for improving the learning curve in assembly processes,"With the introduction of Industry 4.0 the use of worker assistance systems is getting more and more important. Assistance systems should support operators to increase efficiency and to reduce physical and mental stress and thus increase ergonomics of the work. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a projection-based worker assistance system conducting lab experiments simulating a ramp-up situation of a new product in assembly. The specific aim is the investigation of the impact of such systems in assembly for improving the learning curve, when products are changing.

Development and evaluation of design guidelines for cognitive ergonomics in human-robot collaborative assembly systems,"Industry 4.0 is the concept used to summarize the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which is profoundly changing the manufacturing systems and business models all over the world. Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.","['Collaborative robotics', 'Collaborative assembly systems', 'Cognitive ergonomics', 'Human factors', 'Industry 4.0']",Applied Ergonomics,2022,Journal,"['Gualtieri, Luca', 'Fraboni, Federico', 'De Marchi, Matteo', 'Rauch, Erwin']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103807
Updating design guidelines for cognitive ergonomics in human-centred collaborative robotics applications: An expert survey,"Within the framework of Industry 5.0, human factors are essential for enhancing the work conditions and well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart manufacturing systems and machines and increasing production performances. Nevertheless, cognitive ergonomics is often underestimated when implementing advanced industrial human-robot interaction. Thus, this work aims to systematically update, develop, and validate guidelines to assist non-experts in the early stages of the design of anthropocentric and collaborative assembly applications by focusing on the main features that have positively influenced workers' cognitive responses. A methodology for structured development has been proposed. The draft guidelines have been created starting from the outcomes of a systematic and extended screening of the scientific literature. Preliminary validation has been carried out with the help of researchers working in the field. Inputs on comprehensibility and relevance have been gathered to enhance the guidelines. Lastly, a survey was used to examine in depth how international experts in different branches can interpret such guidelines. In total, 108 responders were asked to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the guideline's comprehensibility and provide general comments or suggestions for each guideline. Based on the survey's results, the guidelines have been validated and some have been reviewed and re-written in their final form. The present work highlights that integrating human factors into the design of collaborative applications can significantly bolster manufacturing operations' resilience through inclusivity and system adaptability by enhancing worker safety, ergonomics, and wellbeing.","['Human-robot interaction', 'Collaborative robotics', 'Cognitive ergonomics', 'Industry 5.0', 'Human-centred design']",Applied Ergonomics,2024,Journal,"['Gualtieri, Luca', 'Fraboni, Federico', 'Brendel, Hannah', 'Pietrantoni, Luca', 'Vidoni, Renato', 'Dallasega, Patrick']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104246
A framework to design a human-centred adaptive manufacturing system for aging workers,"The so-called smart manufacturing systems (SMS) combine smart manufacturing technologies, cyber-physical infrastructures, and data control to realize predictive and adaptive behaviours. In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 45–64years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers’ needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers’ wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers’ skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality.","['Smart manufacturing systems', 'Adaptive manufacturing systems', 'Cyber-physical systems', 'Human factors', 'Aging workers', 'Usability']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2017,Journal,"['Peruzzini, Margherita', 'Pellicciari, Marcello']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2017.02.003
Aging in Industry 5.0: Enhancing Human–Robot Synergy in Manufacturing and Logistics,"This paper presents a systematic literature review exploring the impact of human–robot (HR) systems on older workers in manufacturing and logistics industries, drawing insights into how these systems can be optimally designed to address human factors in four key areas—perceptual, physical, cognitive, and psychosocial—aligning with the goals of Industry 5.0. By analyzing 19 articles selected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, we identified both the benefits and challenges that HR systems pose to the aging workforce. We conclude that to achieve Industry 5.0 goals, HR systems must be designed to balance automation with human skills, promoting adaptability and inclusivity tailored to the diverse responses of older workers.","['Aging', 'Human–robot systems', 'Manufacturing', 'Logistics', 'Industry 5.0', 'Human-centricity']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2024,Journal,"['Ranasinghe, Thilini', 'Grosse, Eric H.', 'Lerher, Tone']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2024.09.239
Aging Workforce and Learning: State-of-the-art,"The population of most developed countries is aging; thus, the median age of the global workforce continues to rise. Human aging often results in a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, which may adversely affect the performance of labor-intensive manufacturing systems. Older workers embody profound experience and refined skills, which are success factors for manufacturing companies. Therefore, it is important for manufacturing companies to ensure that older workers remain active and productive. Identifying the potential of an aging workforce, employing technical assistance systems to meet their needs, customizing work flow processes, imparting proper training, and utilizing their experience and skills may provide a competitive advantage for the company. This paper reviews the relevant literature to understand how aging influences workers’ learning in the manufacturing and service industries and identifies management concepts and technologies suitable to support an active aging workforce. We report preliminary insights and discuss selected papers on how aging influences learning-by-doing, life-long learning, training, and experiential knowledge retention.

The relation between cognitive and organizational factors in the production environment,"The adoption of I4.0’s technologies in the work cells accompanied by societal changes calls for new approaches to manage the current production systems. Nevertheless, the current models simulating the behavior of the work cells limit the representation of the operators to the average human, without regard for their individual characteristics, cognitive abilities or psychosocial state. The aim of this paper is to achieve two objectives: firstly, the authors propose a conceptual model for enhancing a human-centered production environment. Secondly, the paper summarizes how the literature characterizes the different dimensions of relations between cognitive and organizational factors. By integrating the collaborative, psychological, social, cognitive, organizational and system performance dimensions, the proposed model focuses on the relationships between these dimensions. Thus, operational models should be closer to the real production environment to improve the design choices of the manufacturing systems.","['Human-machine interaction', 'modeling', 'human-centered approach', 'cognitive', 'organizational factors', 'psychosocial work environment']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2024,Journal,"['Sahyoun, Vincent', 'Petronijevic, Jelena', 'Etienne, Alain', 'Krings, Bettina-Johanna', 'Moniz, Antonio', 'Siadat, Ali']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2024.09.140
User-Centered Back-Support Exoskeleton: Design and Prototyping,"Exhausting manual labor is still predominant in the industrial context. It typically consists in manipulating heavy parts or working in nonergonomic conditions. The resulting work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem to tackle. The most-affected body section is the lumbar spine. Recently, exoskeletons have been identified as a possible non-invasive solution to reduce the impact of low-back pain. State-of-the-art prototypes have been optimized to: follow unconstrained human kinematics, (partially) relieve the load on assisted joints, and allow anthropometric adaptation. Yet, this technology still has limited adoption. Manufacturing optimization may address the following limitations: bulky/heavy resulting designs, complex assembly and maintenance, high manufacturing costs, long procedures for adaptation and wearing, and psychological effects (e.g., cognitive load and usability). In this contribution, the aforementioned issues are tackled improving a previous low-back exoskeleton prototype. In particular, kinematic analysis, Finite-Element-Method, and topological optimization have been combined to obtain a lightweight prototype, testing different materials (Nylon, carbon-fiber reinforced PC/ABS, etc.).We applied both Design for Assembly and Design for Manufacturability. The resulting exoskeleton prototype is described in the paper, ready for end-user field tests","['back-support;', 'exoskeleton', 'topological optimization', 'mechanical design', 'materials selection', 'backbone-based kinematics', 'industry4.0', 'ndustry5.0.']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Roveda, Loris', 'Pesenti, Mattia', 'Rossi, Michele', 'Covarrubias Rodriguez, Mario', 'Pedrocchi, Alessandra', 'Braghin, Francesco', 'Gandolla, Marta']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.019
A Strategic Model to take the First Step Towards Industry 4.0 in SMEs,"Over the last few years, there has been a clear evolution in the suppliers of the automotive industry due to constant demands imposed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), systematically requiring an increase in the level of quality and competitiveness of products. The continuous requirement to increase productivity in this sector makes it necessary to modernize technology and the need to monitor all production at a distance, also making the manufacturing process more autonomous. However, more traditional companies in developing countries cannot move abruptly to an integrated production and management system. Thus, it is necessary to establish an industrial implementation strategy for this type of companies. The evolution of the work method on the factory shop-floor must be gradual so that there is a greater effectiveness in the change of working paradigm. This paper aims to establish a model of gradual implementation of industry 4.0 in SMEs currently working in a traditional way, so that workers can have the opportunity to evolve in their cognitive capacities with technological evolution, promoting a symbiosis between technological change and the change of mentality, habits of work and technological knowledge of the workers. In order to test the validity of the model, it was developed a case study, through its implementation in a components’ cutting process for the automotive industry. The progress should follow the whole procedure of assembling and shipping of the intermediate product in order to increase their reliability and monitoring. A production control system based on automation and information was created, which allows the product state to be known in real time, triggering the whole process of logistics and subsequent processing in a completely automatic way. After the implementation of this pilot system, it is much simpler to proceed with the training and technological updating of the workers regarding the following processes.","['Industry 4.0', 'Automotive industry', 'Automation', 'Assembly lines', 'Processes integration', 'Production scheduling', 'Smart Manufacturing']",Procedia Manufacturing,2019,Journal,"['Pinto, B.', 'Silva, F.J.G.', 'Costa, T.', 'Campilho, R.D.S.G.', 'Pereira, M.T.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.01.082
Enhancing human-guided robotic assembly: AR-assisted DT for skill-based and low-code programming,"Efficient and natural programming strategies play a crucial role in enabling human-guided robotic assembly to adapt quickly to dynamic tasks. The combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twins (DT) has shown promising potential in enhancing the intuitiveness of human–robot interaction while leveraging digital representations of human intelligence to empower robots in manufacturing tasks. However, traditional programming methods lack intuitive interaction and rely heavily on simulation environments or pre-set CAD models, leading to high costs for both initial setup and sim-to-real deployment. On the other hand, existing AR-based robot control methods have primarily focused on the basic movements of robots, overlooking higher-level skills necessary for complex tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces a four-layer system architecture that integrates AR-assisted DT into skill-based robotic assembly scenarios. Additionally, a skill-based and low-code programming system for human-guided robotic assembly is designed and implemented, which incorporates natural human guidance and robot autonomous intelligence to generate adaptive and feasible action plans. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are verified by two case studies and a quantitative experiment comparing to traditional programming methods. The results demonstrate the usability of our AR-assisted DT approach in improving programming efficiency, intuitiveness, and safety for human-guided robotic assembly while reducing cognitive load.","['Augmented reality', 'Digital twin', 'Robot programming', 'Robotic assembly', 'Human–robot interaction']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2024,Journal,"['Yin, Yue', 'Zheng, Pai', 'Li, Chengxi', 'Wan, Ke']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.04.016
A Systematic Approach to Task Assignment and Production Planning in Disassembly with Employee Skills,"An emerging shortage of resources fosters a development for strategies for the circularity of products and resources. Due to the different states of returned end-of-life products, the complexity for employees in disassembly increases. This work aims to provide an approach for an optimal allocation of disassembly tasks to individual employees and therefore enable a basis for planning and control in disassembly. At first, a task description is provided based on which a standardized time for operations is considered. Second, a link is created between the task description and the product state. Depending on the product state the time determined prior can be adjusted. Third, human skills are considered in manufacturing. It is assumed that within a production system there are different employees with different, developing skill sets. Based on specific skills, a task-to-person-is conducted. Using the information gathered, a Digital Twin (DT) that includes the human nature of the employees and their state is created to enable a simulation of tasks and thereby also a learning system for “first-time-seen” products. When facing complex tasks, the cognitive load and human's fatigue are decisive for performance and thereby the time required for execution. Completing these steps, a multistage concept is created that enables a more precise disassembly planning that can be shown in the case study on the example of components of electric vehicles.","['Human Digital Twin', 'Disassembly', 'Industry 4.0', 'Process Planning and Control']",Procedia CIRP,2023,Journal,"['Dvorak, Julia', 'Wurster, Marco', 'May, Marvin Carl', 'Lanza, Gisela']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.09.107
A comparative study on computer-integrated set-ups to design human-centred manufacturing systems,"Manufacturing ergonomics refers to the application of ergonomic principles and human factors analysis to the design of manufacturing tasks with the final aim to optimize the workers’ wellbeing and guarantee the expected process performance. Traditional design approaches are based on the observation of individual workers performing their jobs, the detection of unnatural postures (e.g., bending, twisting, overextending, rotating), and the definition of late corrective actions according to ergonomic guidelines. Recently, computer-integrated simulations based on virtual prototypes and digital human models (DHMs) can be used to assess manufacturing ergonomics on virtual manikins operating in digital workplaces. Such simulations allow validating different design alternatives and optimizing the workstation design before the creation, and pave the way to a new approach to manufacturing system design. The present paper aims at comparing different computer-integrated set-ups to support the design of human-centred manufacturing workstations. It defines a protocol analysis to support workstation design by analysing both physical and cognitive aspects, and applies the protocol within different digital set-ups. In particular, the study investigates a 2D desktop set-up using standardized DHMs and a 3D immersive mixed reality set-up based on motion capture of real workers’ acting into a mixed environment, comparing them with the traditional approach. An industrial case study focusing on design optimization of a manufacturing workstation in the energy industry is used to test the effectiveness of the two digital set-ups for the definition of re-design actions.","['Manufacturing ergonomics', 'Human factors', 'Digital human models', 'Human-centred design', 'Mixed reality']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2019,Journal,"['Peruzzini, Margherita', 'Pellicciari, Marcello', 'Gadaleta, Michele']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2018.03.009
Forming a cognitive automation strategy for Operator 4.0 in complex assembly,"Due to today’s technological advances in the area of Industry 4.0, having a strategy for cognitive automation solutions is crucial. Operator 4.0, will have handle and manage different work tasks ranging from learning new tasks to solving difficult problems and initiate changes. To support the operator moving between these tasks a specific strategy for the design of cognitive automation solutions is needed. The suggested strategy has three steps: (1) select assembly modes, (2) choose level of cognitive automation carrier and (3) suggest cognitive automation content. It is important that the operator is part of the design and that the solution supports movement between the modes learning, operational and disruptive modes. The strategy could support manufacturing companies meeting challenges regarding social sustainability e.g. stress, attractive workplaces and demography changes as well as system transparency and complexity.","['Human factors', 'Ergonomics', 'Complexity', 'Operator 4.0', 'Industry 4.0', 'Human-automation interaction']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2020,Journal,"['Mattsson, Sandra', 'Fast-Berglund, Åsa', 'Li, Dan', 'Thorvald, Peter']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2018.08.011
Productivity and ergonomic risk in human based production systems: A job-rotation scheduling model,"The competitiveness of modern manufacturing systems is based on a high production rate and a high level of flexibility. Despite the high level of automation achieved in production systems, flexibility is often provided by human dexterity and the cognitive capabilities of the workforce, as in assembly lines. In the case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In these contexts, a high production rate leads to high physical workload, and job rotation is adopted in order to reduce the ergonomic risk. Traditionally, ergonomics and human performance issues have been investigated separately. However, in the design and scheduling of human-based manufacturing systems, a reliable description of human components is required in order to jointly evaluate production system performance and assess workers׳ risk of MSDs In this paper, the authors propose a model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is a mixed integer programming model allowing for the maximization of production rate jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the OCRA (OCcupational Repetitive Actions) method (ISO 11228-3:2007), widely recognized as an effective tool for the risk assessment of Upper Limb Work related MSDs (UL-WMSDs). Moreover, the different workers׳ performance due to their respective training levels and skills is considered in the problem formulation. The model is applied to an industrial case study. Results show the model׳s capacity to identify optimal job rotation schedules jointly achieving productivity and ergonomic risk goals. Performances of the solutions obtained improve as workforce flexibility increases.","['Job rotation', 'Human workload balancing', 'UL-WMSDs', 'OCRA', 'Mathematical programming', 'Automotive']",International Journal of Production Economics,2016,Journal,"['Mossa, G.', 'Boenzi, F.', 'Digiesi, S.', 'Mummolo, G.', 'Romano, V.A.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.06.017
A human-centred workstation in industry 4.0 for balancing the industrial productivity and human well-being,"Cyber-physical productions systems (CPPS) play a fundamental role in the fourth industrial revolution along with human centred design. The consideration of these two factors leads to the concept of human centred cyber-physical production systems (H-CPPSs), which are defined as systems that support humans, machines, and software to integrate virtual and physical worlds. H-CPPS are not intended to substitute for human operators but rather to support and augment their capabilities and ensure their well-being. Limited information currently exists about workstation design from an ergonomic perspective and a proper method for including a workstation in a H-CPPS. This paper proposes a methodology that allows identification of industrial requirements and ergonomic considerations for establishing guidelines to integrate Industry 4.0 principles in the manufacturing shopfloor of large and small-medium enterprises by designing a workstation framework that balances operator well-being and manufacturing productivity. First, this approach evaluates a set of general production tasks from the manufacturing industry, assesses the ergonomic risks during execution and identifies the technological enablers to balance human productivity and well-being. Second, this approach provides a set of guidelines for deploying a generic human centred workstation with ergonomic considerations. Finally, this paper describes a case study in which a human-centred workstation was constructed as a proof of concept of the proposed methodology. Experimental tests were applied to find significant statistical improvements between controlled and experimental scenario. The experimental results determined from the methodological constructed workstation with human-centred considerations contributes to reduce the ergonomic risk on industrial operators without affecting its productivity.","['Cyber-physical production system', 'Human-centred', 'Ergonomics', 'Risk assessment', 'Well-being']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2022,Journal,"['Forero Velasco, Laura Stefannia', 'Rodríguez Revilla, Pablo Emilio', 'Ruiz Rodríguez, Laura Valentina', 'Santa Hincapié, María Paz', 'Saavedra-Robinson, Luis A.', 'Jiménez, Jose-Fernando']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2022.103355
Validating an abnormal situation prediction model for smart manufacturing in the oil refining industry,"Human beings play an important role in a smart manufacturing economy. The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.","['Statistical modeling prediction', 'Interactive devices', 'Control room', 'Eye-tracking']",Applied Ergonomics,2022,Journal,"['Shi, Chao', 'Rothrock, Ling']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103697
On the development of a method for cognitive load assessment in manufacturing,"The increasing complexity and demands of assembly operations in manufacturing has been shown to lead to increased cognitive load in assembly workers. Previous work has outlined the complexity of an assembly worker's situation both in terms of difficulty and speed of work and there have been a few attempts at creating frameworks and methods for understanding the key aspects of what creates increased cognitive load. This paper presents the development of an analytic method, denoted CLAM (Cognitive Load Assessment for Manufacturing), and a tool for assessing cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly. It outlines the journey of the development as well as discusses and problematizes relevant meta-methodological issues paired with method development. The intended contribution of the work is to make a difference in reducing the cognitive load of assembly workers on the shop floor, thus focusing the development on applicability and usability of the tool in practice. With this purpose in mind, focus of the method development has been on the practitioners, i.e. the method should not require any expert knowledge to be applied. The CLAM method and accompanying documentation such as a handbook containing instructions towards using the method and interpreting the results, is available in an online tool.","['Cognitive load', 'Manufacturing', 'Assembly', 'Method development', 'CLAM method']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2019,Journal,"['Thorvald, Peter', 'Lindblom, Jessica', 'Andreasson, Rebecca']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2019.04.012
A new XR-based human‐robot collaboration assembly system based on industrial metaverse,"The industrial metaverse is an emerging paradigm of integrated information technologies. A human-robot collaboration assembly system is developed using extended reality (XR) and blockchain technologies. This system includes the physical, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) supporting, and blockchain systems. Virtual avatars represent physical operators and mobile robots in the XR environment. The VR system emulates real-time physical operations, facilitating pre-planning, online task optimization, and converting strategic decisions into executable instructions for physical robots. The AR system enhances the cognitive experience of intelligent operators, contributing to decision-making and VR system control through multi-modal interactions. The integration of the VR and AR systems in perception-decision-control enables real-time process optimization and the reverse control of physical operations. The system is implemented using a decentralized blockchain and end-edge-cloud collaborative network architecture to regulate interaction permissions for each scene characters, ensuring systematic functionality, robust communication, and comprehensive data management. A case study of a gearbox assembly is used to demonstrate the system’s development and efficacy. The results indicate the VR system's comprehensive perception and the AR system's detailed insights, yielding reliable information on global and local levels. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and spatiotemporal visualization during VR decision-making provides computational advantages. Incorporating human input into the AR system enables human-in-the-loop operational decision-making, providing optimal instructions to improve human-robot collaboration performance. Notably, the fusion of blockchain and end-edge-cloud architectures augments inter-system data exchange by efficiently managing and processing human-robot interactions and their diverse avatars. This system offers an innovative approach to human-robot collaboration assembly in manufacturing, with implications for analogous contexts.","['Industrial Metaverse', 'Human-robot collaboration assembly', 'Extended reality', 'Blockchain', 'Digital twin', 'E-Manufacturing']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2024,Journal,"['Xie, Jiacheng', 'Liu, Yali', 'Wang, Xuewen', 'Fang, Shukai', 'Liu, Shuguang']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.05.001
Towards the modelling of defect generation in human-robot collaborative assembly,"The development of suitable defect generation models is crucial in both academia and industry having the dual purpose of predicting defects occurring in manufacturing processes and planning eligible effective quality controls. In manual assembly processes, much research focused on developing approaches to predict operator-generated defects. Today, collaborative robotics is gaining increasing attention in smart factories by contributing to the reduction of operators' physical and cognitive workload and thus enabling improved productivity. The present study proposes a preliminary investigation on defect generation models in a human-robot collaborative environment aiming to compare quality performances achieved in purely manual assembly.","['Human-Robot Collaboration', 'Quality Control', 'Manufacturing']",Procedia CIRP,2023,Journal,"['Puttero, Stefano', 'Verna, Elisa', 'Genta, Gianfranco', 'Galetto, Maurizio']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.06.043
An IIoT Platform For Human-Aware Factory Digital Twins,"In the context of the Industry 4.0 approach, applications and solutions supporting monitoring, simulation, optimisation and decision-making in production systems are exponentially growing. These solutions are commonly built on digital twins, i.e., comprehensive, structured and effective digital representations of the production system and its entities, whose current status is constantly updated by the plugged data sources. The arising of the Industry 5.0 paradigm and the established key role of workers in manufacturing require new Digital Twins to represent also humans. In fact, as cognitive automation becomes more and more pervasive and its behaviour unintelligible to humans, it becomes essential for improving performance and well-being, at the same time, to model humans as data-driven agents and to represent their interaction with the factory systems. Currently, a standardised solution for creating Digital Twins is missing, forcing industrial solution architects to resort to ad-hoc implementations and models. These solutions lack re-usability, scalability and extensibility, preventing the introduction of a human digital representation in existent twins, so hindering the complete shift to the new Industry 5.0 paradigm. In this paper, such limitations are faced by introducing an extensible and flexible IIoT-industrial internet of things-based platform with a twofold benefit: on the one hand, to support the creation of customised data representations of production systems and their entities including humans; on the other hand, to provide a modular infrastructure, along with its interchangeable components, for easy digital twin instantiation and ramp-up. An implementation of the platform has been tested with different applications in a laboratory setting and released as a public resource. Finally, potential future applications of the proposed digital twin are discussed, highlighting its main benefits.","['Human Digital Twin (HDT)', 'Cyber Physical Systems (CPS)', 'Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)', 'Reference Data Model', 'Industry 5.0']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Montini, Elias', 'Cutrona, Vincenzo', 'Bonomi, Niko', 'Landolfi, Giuseppe', 'Bettoni, Andrea', 'Rocco, Paolo', 'Carpanzano, Emanuele']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.042
Specifying task allocation in automotive wire harness assembly stations for Human-Robot Collaboration,"Wire harness assembly is normally a manual assembly process that poses ergonomic challenges. As a consequence of the rapidly expanding electrification of vehicles and transportation systems, the demand for wire harnesses can be expected to grow radically, further increasing assembly operator challenges. Thus, automating this assembly process is highly prioritised by production engineers. The rapid development of industrial robot technology has enabled more human-robot collaboration possibilities, simplifying the automation of wire harness process tasks. However, successful automation applications involving humans require efficient and safe allocation of tasks between humans and technology. Unfortunately, present assembly system design methods may be obsolete and insufficient in light of the capabilities of emerging automation technologies such as collaborative robots. This paper presents a design and specification methodology for human-centred manufacturing systems and focuses on collaborative assembly operations in complex production systems. A case study on human-robot collaboration provides an application example from a wire-harness collaborative assembly process. The proposed design methodology combines hierarchical task analysis with assessments of cognitive and physical Levels of Automation (LoAc and LoAp). The assessments are then followed by evaluations of the Levels of human-robot Collaboration (LoC) and the Levels of operator Skill requirements (LoSr) respectively. A task allocation matrix supports the identification of possible combinations of automation and collaboration solutions for a human-centred and collaborative wire harness assembly process. System designers and integrators may utilise the design and specification methodology to identify the potential and extent of human-robot collaboration in collaborative manufacturing assembly operations.","['Levels of automation (LoA)', 'Automotive', 'Wire Harness', 'Assembly', 'Human-robot collaboration (HRC)']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2023,Journal,"['Salunkhe, Omkar', 'Stahre, Johan', 'Romero, David', 'Li, Dan', 'Johansson, Björn']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109572
Cognitive intelligence in industrial robots and manufacturing,"The transition from manual to autonomous manufacturing processes, which has been propelled by consecutive industrial revolutions, is concurrently contingent upon advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). AI does have dependency on data, making it incompatible in handling industrial uncertainties. Human cognition, adept at navigating uncertain situations, presents a potential solution. This article aims to illuminate the synergy between human cognition and AI algorithms. It underscores the disparity between AI methods and cognitive requirements in manufacturing and robotics through a survey, also proposes methods to infuse cognition into machines and robots for autonomous learning.

Applying a fusion of wearable sensors and a cognitive inspired architecture to real-time ergonomics analysis of manual assembly tasks,"High value manufacturing systems still require ergonomically intensive manual activities. Examples include the aerospace industry where the fitting of pipes and wiring into confined spaces in aircraft wings is still a manual operation. In these environments, workers are subjected to ergonomically awkward forces and postures for long periods of time. This leads to musculoskeletal injuries that severely limit the output of a shopfloor leading to loss of productivity. The use of tools such as wearable sensors could provide a way to track the ergonomics of workers in real time. However, an information processing architecture is required in order to ensure that data is processed in real time and in a manner that meaningful action points are retrieved for use by workers. In this work, based on the Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R) cognitive framework, we propose a Cognitive Architecture for Wearable Sensors (CAWES); a wearable sensor system and cognitive architecture that is capable of taking data streams from multiple wearable sensors on a worker’s body and fusing them to enable digitisation, tracking and analysis of human ergonomics in real time on a shopfloor. Furthermore, through tactile feedback, the architecture is able to inform workers in real time when ergonomics rules are broken. The architecture is validated through the use of an aerospace case study undertaken in laboratory conditions. The results from the validation are encouraging and in the future, further tests will be performed in an actual working environment.","['Real-time', 'Ergonomics', 'Manual assembly', 'Wearable']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2021,Journal,"['Oyekan, J.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Turner, C.', 'Tiwari, A.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.09.015
Multi-sensor fusion based industrial action recognition method under the environment of intelligent manufacturing,"In the context of intelligent manufacturing and Industry 4.0, the manufacturing industry is rapidly transitioning toward mass personalization production. Despite this trend, the assembly industry still relies on manual operations performed by workers, considering their cognitive ability and flexibility. Thereinto, studying operator action perception and recognition methods is a vital filed and of great significance for improving the production efficiency and ensuring product quality. In this paper, a multi-sensor fusion-based data acquisition system is constructed to address the challenge of achieving comprehensive and accurate perception of the assembly process with a single sensor. Then, an action recognition model architecture based on ResNet + LSTM + D-S evidence theory is proposed and established. By fully considering the characteristics of different data, the multi-sensor data values are maximized, data complementarity is achieved, and the recognition accuracy exceeds 97 %.

Intelligent robot assistants for the integration of neurodiverse operators in manufacturing industry,"The integration of neurodiverse operators in industry poses interesting challenges highlighting the potential for human-robot collaboration(HRC) to provide the necessary support and assistance to complete manufacturing tasks. This study proposes a reciprocal learning-based framework to support the operator to carry out assembly tasks via collaborative robot (Cobot) assistance. Such framework includes image acquisition and processing, machine learning (ML)-based classification of workpieces and Cobot operational tasks. An experimental case study is proposed to verify the framework applicability to a number of likely scenarios. Preliminary results show the suitability of HRC systems to effectively aid neurodiverse operator's with memory issues in performing assembly tasks correctly, while at the same time improving the operator's ability to learn the assembly sequence and iteratively improving ML classification accuracy.

Decoding the silent language: A framework for advanced visual emotion recognition to enhance worker well-being on IIoT-enabled manufacturing,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), pivotal in the Industry 4.0 revolution, has transformed manufacturing, particularly assembly lines, by enabling real-time process monitoring and data analysis to enhance productivity. Yet, its potential impact on worker well-being has been less explored. As the National Association of Manufacturers anticipates an opening of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, the necessity for frameworks that not only understand but also improve employee well-being becomes apparent. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive visual emotion recognition framework that incorporates facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotional body posture recognition (EBPR) to assess workers’ psychological states. This initiative aims to mitigate human errors and accidents linked to stress or high cognitive load, thereby enhancing the manufacturing environment. Strategies such as optimized break time planning, line balancing, procedure modifications, and improved training are proposed to ensure both employee well-being and stakeholder benefits. This framework indirectly supports the industry’s efforts to address the looming challenge of unfilled jobs by fostering a supportive work environment that enhances job satisfaction, potentially making positions more appealing and retaining valuable talent. By bridging the gap between technological advancements and human-centric considerations, our approach underscores the significance of integrating IIoT solutions with employee welfare initiatives to address both productivity and workforce sustainability challenges.","['Emotion recognition', 'IIoT', 'Assembly line', 'Facial expression', 'Posture', 'Employee well-being']",Manufacturing Letters,2024,Journal,"['Rezaei, Niloofar', 'Vaezi, Seyed Alireza', 'Camelio, Jaime A.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mfglet.2024.09.162
Worker-centered evaluation and redesign of manufacturing tasks for ergonomics improvement using axiomatic design principles,"Humans are considered the most valuable resource in manufacturing systems thanks to their craftsmanship, dexterity, and autonomy significantly affecting productivity, quality, and the overall company competitiveness. This paper introduces the SAGE (Systematic Approach to Generating Ergonomic Manufacturing tasks) methodology, a structured approach based on Axiomatic Design principles to integrate Human Factors evaluation early in the operations design phase and redesign manufacturing tasks to improve operators well-being. The primary objective is to mitigate discomfort and safety risks that often lead to musculoskeletal disorders, absenteeism, and production delays. SAGE provides a comprehensive framework for assessing ergonomic aspects of manufacturing tasks and identifying the need for redesign. It offers a detailed set of Functional Requirements (FRs) for reference, assesses FR satisfaction, evaluates task complexity using the Independence Axiom, and examines the intensity of FR satisfaction through the Information Axiom. The methodology includes specific implementation guidelines, ensuring its applicability across diverse manufacturing contexts. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a large-scale parts assembly case study inspired by the bus and coach industrial sector, where a production engineer evaluated a windows assembly task and identified ergonomic design interventions. A comparative analysis with other relevant methods is finally presented, highlighting the approach's effectiveness.","['Worker-centric design', 'Workplace design', 'Ergonomics assessment', 'Manufacturing task design']",CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology,2024,Journal,"['Arkouli, Z.', 'Michalos, G.', 'Kokotinis, G.', 'Makris, S.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cirpj.2024.10.001
Barriers and enablers for the adoption of sustainable design practices using new design methods – Accelerating the sustainability transformation in the manufacturing industry,"Product development and manufacturing organizations struggle in their sustainability transformation and do not sufficiently contribute to sustainable production and consumption. Design researchers, at the same time, develop and propose a plethora of new and improved design methods that can support the manufacturing industry in such transformation. It is, despite this, well-documented in literature that the industrial adoption of such proposed design methods is challenging. Previous research in the design domain has mainly studied this issue from a process and methodological perspective, whereas previous research in the management domain instead has focused on organizational, and human-behavioral aspects. This poses a research gap for more interdisciplinary research that studies the adoption of design methods from all three perspectives (i.e., process and methodology, organization, and human behavior). Six parallel case studies were carried out with three different product development and manufacturing organizations to collect qualitative empirical data. Glaserian grounded theory was used to analyze the collected data. This resulted in a descriptive framework that captures 53 interdisciplinary factors influencing the adoption of sustainable design practices using new and improved design methods. The descriptive framework is compared to interdisciplinary literature to further clarify and explain the findings, highlighting both practical and theoretical implications. This research provides three main contributions to theory and practice: (1) Two new concepts are introduced and used to explain the empirical findings, which are referred to as the dualism of design methods, and the situational design problem; (2) Nine systemic barriers and eight propositions are formulated, which highlight the need for a paradigm shift in how design is practiced in industry, how cognitive biases inside organizations can lead to a state of pseudo-sustainability, and the need for improved information and data management capabilities in organizations; (3) Sustainable design thinking is proposed as an potential enabler to address several of the main barriers, as it aims to provide a base competence of sustainable design to systematically challenge cognitive biases inside organizations.","['Sustainable design practices', 'Sustainability transformation', 'Industrial adoption', 'Design methods', 'Glaserian grounded theory']",Sustainable Production and Consumption,2024,Journal,"['Mallalieu, Adam', 'Isaksson Hallstedt, Sophie', 'Isaksson, Ola', 'Watz, Matilda', 'Almefelt, Lars']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2024.08.023
Task reallocation of human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model,"As collaborative robots become more popular in industry, they are used to collaborate with human workers and free human workers from repeated and heavy work and reduce the risk of physical injuries. However, human workers need to finish tasks that require high cognitive abilities, which increases the risk of mental fatigue. Fatigue can negatively impact workers and even threaten the safety of workers. Currently, the dynamics of human fatigue model are rarely considered. Hence, it is crucial to develop a dynamic allocation method for human-robot collaborative tasks that considers dynamic human fatigue to ensure efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. This paper proposes a task reallocation method for human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model. A fatigue feature extraction method from multimodal data and a fatigue evaluation network are proposed to evaluate the current fatigue status of human workers. Based on the evaluation results, the human fatigue model is dynamically updated. If the worker’s fatigue state changes, a task reallocation scheme is generated by an improved genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning and the dynamic human fatigue model. The experimental results show that the proposed model and algorithm are effective and efficient, and can provide innovative insights for realizing a human-centered manufacturing workshop.","['Human-robot collaboration (HRC)', 'Dynamic human fatigue model', 'Task reallocation', 'Improved genetic algorithm', 'Reinforcement learning']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2024,Journal,"['Yao, Bitao', 'Li, Xinyu', 'Ji, Zhenrui', 'Xiao, Kun', 'Xu, Wenjun']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109855
Virtual training for assembly tasks: a framework for the analysis of the cognitive impact on operators,"The importance of training for operators in industrial contexts is widely highlighted in literature. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is considered an efficient solution for training, since it provides immersive, realistic, and interactive simulations environments where the operator can learn-by-doing, far from the risks of the real field. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by several studies, but a proper assessment of the operator’s cognitive response in terms of stress and cognitive load, during the use of such technology, is still lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of user’s cognitive states, suitable for each kind of training in the industrial sector and beyond. Preliminary feasibility analysis refers to virtual training for assembly of agricultural vehicles. The proposed protocol analysis allowed understanding the operators’ loads to optimize the VR training application, considering the mental demand during the training, and thus avoiding stress, mental overload, improving the user performance.","['Virtual Reality', 'Virtual assembly', 'Industrial ergonomics', 'Training Assessment', 'Cognitive ergonomics']",Procedia Manufacturing,2021,Journal,"['Brunzini, Agnese', 'Grandi, Fabio', 'Peruzzini, Margherita', 'Pellicciari, Marcello']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2021.10.072
Assembly complexity and physiological response in human-robot collaboration: Insights from a preliminary experimental analysis,"Industry 5.0 paradigm has renewed interest in the human sphere, emphasizing the importance of workers’ well-being in manufacturing activities. In such context, collaborative robotics originated as a technology to support humans in tiring and repetitive tasks. This study investigates the effects of assembly complexity in Human-Robot collaboration using physiological indicators of cognitive effort. In a series of experiments, participants performed assembly processes of different products with varying complexity, in two modalities: manually and with cobot assistance. Physiological measures, including skin conductance, heart rate variability and eye-tracking metrics were collected. The analysis of physiological signals showed trends suggesting the impact of assembly complexity and cobot support. One key finding of the study is that a single physiological signal usually may not provide a complete understanding of cognitive load. Therefore, a holistic approach should be followed. This approach highlighted the importance of considering multiple measures simultaneously to accurately assess workers’ well-being in industrial environments.","['Assembly complexity', 'Human-robot collaboration', 'Physiological signals', 'Humans’ well-being', 'Industry 5.0']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2024,Journal,"['Capponi, Matteo', 'Gervasi, Riccardo', 'Mastrogiacomo, Luca', 'Franceschini, Fiorenzo']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2024.102789
Distracted worker: Using pupil size and blink rate to detect cognitive load during manufacturing tasks,"This study sets out to extend the use of blink rate and pupil size to the assessment of cognitive load of completing common automotive manufacturing tasks. Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks.","['Cognitive load', 'Blink rate', 'Pupil size', 'Manufacturing']",Applied Ergonomics,2023,Journal,"['Biondi, Francesco N.', 'Saberi, Babak', 'Graf, Frida', 'Cort, Joel', 'Pillai, Prarthana', 'Balasingam, Balakumar']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103867
New perspectives and results for Smart Operators in industry 4.0: A human-centered approach,"Digital solutions (including Extended Reality as well as web, mobile and AI technologies), among others, are entering a broad variety of industries and modifying the capabilities of operators through (close to) real-time display of context-dependent information. However, little is known with respect to two major issues: (i) how these technologies can be seamlessly integrated for product/process and overall manufacturing system management providing of syntactic, semantic and functional interoperability and reusability among the different manufacturing systems departments; (ii) how they can be conveyed to operators also taking into account the cognitive load that is incurred by the operators. To this end, starting from a previous article (Longo et al., 2017), this article designs and proposes the KNOW4I approach and its practical implementation in an ICT platform (the KNOW4I platform) to further empower the Smart Operators concept. Two major objectives are pursued. The former is to set a standard referred to as the KNOW4I methodological approach for knowledge representation, knowledge management and digital contents management within the Smart Operator domain. The latter is the implementation of the aforementioned approach as part of the KNOW4I platform that includes a suite of Smart Utilities and Objects intelligently and interactively linked with a newly released version of the Sophos-MS digital and intelligent Assistant. Experimentations and results based on multiple KPIs are carried out to account for the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","['Smart factory', 'Smart operators', 'Industry 4.0', 'Extended reality', 'Digital and intelligent assistants']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,"['Longo, Francesco', 'Nicoletti, Letizia', 'Padovano, Antonio']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2021.107824
Towards Multimodal Information Systems for Assisting Humans in Production and Logistics Processes,"Information support systems for coping with and mastering increasing process complexity are becoming a success factor for many companies. The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0.","['Keywords', 'Industry 5.0', 'Information Systems', 'Cognitive Assistance', 'Human Computer Interface']",Procedia CIRP,2023,Journal,"['Börold, Axel', 'Schweers, Dirk', 'Freitag, Michael']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.09.130
Assessment of a large language model based digital intelligent assistant in assembly manufacturing,"The use of Digital Intelligent Assistants (DIAs) in manufacturing aims to enhance performance and reduce cognitive workload. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research aims to understand the impact of DIAs on assembly processes, emphasizing human-centric design and operational efficiency. The study is novel in considering the three primary objectives: evaluating the technical robustness of DIAs, assessing their effect on operators' cognitive workload and user experience, and determining the overall performance improvement of the assembly process. Methodologically, the research employs a laboratory experiment, incorporating a controlled setting to meticulously assess the DIA's performance. The experiment used a between-subjects design comparing a group of participants using the DIA against a control group relying on traditional manual methods across a series of assembly tasks. Findings reveal a significant enhancement in the operators' experience, a reduction in cognitive load, and an improvement in the quality of process outputs when the DIA is employed. The article contributes to the study of the DIA's potential and AI integration in manufacturing, offering insights into the design, development, and evaluation of DIAs in industrial settings.","['Chatbot', 'Experimental design', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Natural language processing', 'Industry 4.0', 'Industry 5.0']",Computers in Industry,2024,Journal,"['Colabianchi, Silvia', 'Costantino, Francesco', 'Sabetta, Nicolò']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2024.104129
Human-centred data-driven redesign of simulation-based training: a qualitative study applied on two use cases of the healthcare and industrial domains,"Among the main features of Industry 4.0, digitization and the evolution of the human-machine interaction occupy a central role. These concepts are transferring even in the health domain, moving toward Healthcare 4.0. The new concept of Industry 5.0 further promotes the human-centric perspective focusing on the consideration of human factors. In this context, training for workers, both in the industry and in the healthcare sectors, needs to be strongly human-centred to be efficient and effective. This paper refers to simulation-based training and aims to provide a transdisciplinary framework for the simulation assessment from the learners’ perspective. The final scope is to outline a set of data-driven guidelines for the simulation optimization and redesign, throughout a human-centred approach, aiming to improve the workers’ performance and the overall learning process, considering the physical, cognitive, and emotional conditions. The proposed method is suitable for each kind of training (both traditional and with the use of virtual reality/augmented reality systems) and relevant for every sector. Two different use cases are presented, respectively referring to the healthcare and industry fields, proposing a unique assessment protocol. The healthcare use case considered the low-fidelity simulation of lumbar puncture, while the industrial use case referred to the replacement of the engine oil filter on tractors. Although the great differences between the content of the use cases, the results obtained about performance as well as cognitive and emotional states are close enough to define a common set of guidelines to redesign and optimize the simulation-based training.","['Healthcare 4.0', 'Industry 4.0', 'Simulation-based training', 'Design optimization', 'Human Factors', 'Ergonomics']",Journal of Industrial Information Integration,2023,Journal,"['BRUNZINI, Agnese', 'PERUZZINI, Margherita', 'BARBADORO, Pamela']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jii.2023.100505
On the Selection of Ergonomics Evaluation Methods for Human Centric Manufacturing Tasks,"The last years several methods and sensors have emerged for the assessment of the physical and cognitive loads that human workers experience during the execution of manufacturing tasks. Questionnaires, videos, simulation data, IMU sensors, etc. are some of the data collection methods that can provide important data for the physical (skeleton joint angles, perceived fatigue, covered distance, and so forth), as well as for the cognitive (e.g., perceived user experience, eye movement, latency of movement) workload evaluation. However, there is no commonly accepted method to guide the practitioners in selecting the appropriate method and means to evaluate their task of interest. This paper goes a step further from the existing formal guidelines by considering aspects such as the stage of development of the manufacturing tasks and weighting the cognitive and physical aspects as per the task’s nature. The proposed multi-criteria decision making method will map the custom requirements of each case in terms of cost, time, expertise, and available technology to the ones that each data collection method can meet in order to suggest an appropriate method. The proposed approach is applied in a case study coming from the bus and coach sector, where a mixed task (cognitive and physical effort) is assessed using video recordings and interviews.","['human centric design', 'ergonomics assessment', 'physical workload evaluation', 'cognitive workload evaluation']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Arkouli, Zoi', 'Michalos, George', 'Makris, Sotiris']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.04.015
Artificial General Intelligence vs. Industry 4.0: Do They Need Each Other?,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is known to be a driving force behind the Industry 4.0. Nowadays the current hype on development and industrial adoption of the AI systems is mostly associated with the deep learning, i.e., with the abilities of the AI to perform various specific cognitive activities better than humans do. However, what about the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), associated with the generic ability of a machine to perform consciously any task that a human can? Do we have many samples of the AGI research adopted by Industry 4.0 and used for smart manufacturing? In this paper, we report the systematic mapping study regarding the AGI-related papers (published during the five-year period) to find out whether AGI is giving up its positions within AI as an attractive tool to address the industry needs. We show what the major concerns of the AGI academic community are nowadays and how the AGI findings have been already or could be potentially applied within the Industry 4.0. We have discovered that the gap between the AGI studies and the industrial needs is still high and even has some indications to grow. However, some AGI-related findings have potential to make real value in smart manufacturing.","['Artificial general intelligence', 'Industry 4.0', 'systematic mapping study', 'google distance']",Procedia Computer Science,2022,Journal,"['Kumpulainen, Samu', 'Terziyan, Vagan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.01.213
"Augmented Workforce: contextual, cross-hierarchical enquiries on human-technology integration in industry","Although shop floors become more automated, manual labor is more than the sum of recurring tasks which can simply be executed by autonomous machines. Where total automation is ineffective, operator assistance systems (OAS) could increase productivity and empower the workforce. Operator Assistance Systems (OAS) are systems that interact with operators to modify their cognitive or physical capabilities whilst performing industrial tasks. Given the important role of humans in future manufacturing environments that cannot be automated, production organizations in industry and Human-Technology Integration (HTI) researchers need to understand where OAS can be deployed and what human factors and other human implications arise from their deployment. In short, capturing views from stakeholders who are both affected by and affect the successful implementation of new technologies are essential to align technological innovations with a human-centric perspective. However, based on our literature review of OAS, we find that there are few technology-neutral enquiries on the industrial applicability of OAS. In particular, we note a lack of considerations of the different requirements for OAS resulting from diverse stakeholders in industry, which is expected to be of importance when designing effective HTI. To address this gap, we explore the industrial context of OAS and the perspectives of stakeholder groups across organizations on the applicability of OAS using a multi-method research approach encompassing 27 qualitative expert interviews and ethnographic observations of three industrial contexts. A key finding of our contextual enquiry is that participants expect OAS to be beneficial on shop floors if designed to improve cognitive abilities, such as inductive reasoning. Further, in the case a company seeks to introduce an OAS to augment physical capabilities of operators whilst attached to their bodies, the data indicate a cautious approach is sensible as many operators reject such a form of augmentation. We highlight what our findings mean for HTI research, especially as it relates to consideration of the highly contextual user requirements when developing and integrating human-technology systems for industry.","['Industry 4.0', 'Human-centered', 'Future of work', 'Operator assistance system', 'Worker support', 'Cyber-physical production system', 'Augmented Industries']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,"['Moencks, Mirco', 'Roth, Elisa', 'Bohné, Thomas', 'Kristensson, Per Ola']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2021.107822
Use of Lean Management Methods based on Eye-Tracking Information to make User Interfaces in Production more Human-centered,"Manufacturing Execution Systems are a state-of-the-art technology in industrial companies. Being a core enabler during Industry 4.0, these software solutions are still growing. This is underlined by companies like SAP, that has launched a new cloud-based module for manufacturing execution, even though they already have been well positioned in this market. Due to the amount of opportunities given to interact more with operators via user interfaces, many disciplines use this format for bringing in their information. Information overload for the worker could be the consequence. This paper evaluates the idea of using the results given from tracking the worker’s eye movement to apply classical Lean Management methods for layout optimization, such as 5S. In order to deal with the risk of information overload, the theoretical background of Eye-Tracking and Lean Management are explained. In this paper, the idea as well as its proof of concept is described in the Analysis part. In detail, the resulting Heatmap from worker’s gaze point will be compared with a Spaghetti Diagram and its information for the 5S approach. Thus, further research and suggestions for an experimental design to evaluate the influence of those potential optimizations on the cognitive ergonomics of the operators are discussed.","['Lean Management', 'Manufacturing Execution System', 'Human-centered design', 'Eye-Tracking']",Procedia CIRP,2024,Journal,"['Dörner, Andreas', 'Pirkl, Gerald', 'Simon, Michal', 'Bures, Marek']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2024.04.014
Lessons Learned from Human Pose Interaction in an Industrial Spatial Augmented Reality Application,"This paper is a technical description of a novel Augmented Reality application in the industrial domain of furniture production. In the presented case, workers suffered from high cognitive load in doing end-of-line quality inspection and individual handling of a high variety of products. The proposed solution consists of a Spatial Augmented Reality system, where a projector directly displays information on the product to assist the worker. At the same time results of an in-line quality inspections are shown which can be interactively modified through human gestures. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) in contrast to other industrial augmented reality applications the described one technically builds upon a deep neural net based pose estimation. This allows a seamless interaction with the system and tracking of human actions rather than deriving them from the current state of the work piece, (2) the paper recapitulates experiences and results of the approach with a focus on lessons learned for using human pose estimation in smart production.","['Extended Reality', 'Spatial Augmented Reality', 'Worker Assistance', 'Quality Inspection', 'Human Pose Estimation', 'Data Fusion']",Procedia Computer Science,2023,Journal,"['Stübl, Gernot', 'Heindl, Christoph', 'Ebenhofer, Gerhard', 'Bauer, Harald', 'Pichler, Andreas']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.288
UX assessment strategy to identify potential stressful conditions for workers,"The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance. This research was funded by the European Community's HORIZON 2020 programme under grant agreement No. 958303 (PENELOPE).","['User experience', 'Human-centred design', 'Industry 5.0', 'Virtual reality', 'Cognitive ergonomics']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2022,Journal,"['Khamaisi, Riccardo Karim', 'Brunzini, Agnese', 'Grandi, Fabio', 'Peruzzini, Margherita', 'Pellicciari, Marcello']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102403
Modeling workers’ behavior: A human factors taxonomy and a fuzzy analysis in the case of industrial accidents,"While ‘Industry 4.0’ drives for greater automation, human factors are still essential in certain domains, especially in industrial disaster management. Despite human factors are frequently cause of individual biases and errors, a systematic quantitative analysis of the correlation between them and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial disaster has never been conducted. The aim of the present study is twofold: to design an original human factors taxonomy, which encompasses all the industrial worker's cognitive capabilities, physical skills, and psychological attitudes; to establish a correlation between each factor and the workers' response performance in case of an industrial emergency. A Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) analysis has been conducted in collaboration with 44 subject matter experts by using an ad-hoc developed tool to investigate, in particular, two types of workers, the role of emergency manager and the emergency team member. Results reveal that the factors have not the same weight in determining the human response performance: cognitive and psychological aspects have a substantial influence on the emergency manager's response performance, while the emergency team member's response performance is more influenced by psychological and physical aspects. Relevance to industry Given the crucial role of cognitive, physical and psychological factors in modern human-centred industrial systems and especially in the field of industrial safety & security, this study represents a meticulous guide for safety specialists in the design of disaster management strategies, for recruiters and practitioners in the development of competency-based job descriptions and for new research works for the development of personality-gifted intelligent agents in industrial applications.","['Industrial accidents', 'Safety management', 'Human behaviour modeling', 'Human factors', 'Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2019,Journal,"['Longo, Francesco', 'Nicoletti, Letizia', 'Padovano, Antonio']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2018.09.002
How to provide work instructions to reduce the workers’ physical and mental workload,"The transition to Industry 5.0 emphasizes the human-centric perspective and pushes for ergonomic risks prevention and mitigation. The diffusion of the production paradigms of mass customization and mass personalization also increases the need for methods and tools to support workers in manufacturing activities. The growing number of product variants requires a higher cognitive load and increases the likelihood of human errors. Work instructions become fundamental, as well as their digitalization. The technologies enabling industry 4.0 have opened up new scenarios for the use of this information, from extended reality to digital assistance systems. This work deals with the human-centered redesign of a workstation for the wire harness assembly with the aim of mitigating the ergonomic risks for operators, both physical and cognitive. Four different scenarios for using the work instructions were implemented and tested: paper-based instructions, workstation display, mixed reality application usable with a head-mounted display, and augmented reality application that only requires a projection system. The experimentation involved user experience evaluation, performance assessment, and objective postural analysis through inertial sensors.","['human-centered manufacturing', 'work instructions', 'ergonomics', 'mixed reality', 'industry 5.0']",Procedia CIRP,2023,Journal,"['Papetti, Alessandra', 'Ciccarelli, Marianna', 'Palpacelli, Matteo Claudio', 'Germani, Michele']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.09.143
Adaptive assembly systems for enabling agile assembly – Empirical analysis focusing on cognitive worker assistance,"Hybrid assembly systems combine the advantages of automated assembly solutions with the cognitive abilities of humans to make assembly more flexible while efficient. Adaptive systems in this context enlarge the scope in which the division of tasks between human and machine can be varied. These systems are an enabling factor for agile assembly since highly situation-aware technologies allow quick reaction in volatile assembly situations. This research focuses on the main opportunities and implementation obstacles of adaptive assembly systems in industrial practice. The results of an empirical study, focusing on cognitive worker assistance, with 132 participants from manufacturing companies, are presented in this paper. Main findings show that the introduction of adaptive worker assistance solutions requires extensive modifications of IT infrastructure. Besides an increase in flexibility, an enlarged potential for the improvement of worker training processes is expected.","['Adaptive assembly', 'Adaptivity', 'Empirical analysis', 'Agile assembly', 'Hybrid assembly', 'Flexibility', 'Worker assistance']",Procedia CIRP,2021,Journal,"['Burggräf, Peter', 'Dannapfel, Matthias', 'Adlon, Tobias', 'Föhlisch, Nils']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2020.05.244
Augmented reality aided object mapping for worker assistance/training in an industrial assembly context: Exploration of affordance with existing guidance techniques,"In recent years, the affordances of immersive technologies in the industrial context have enabled the onsite worker to have increased potential towards handling the complex procedural and cognitive tasks involved in the strategy of manufacturing an appropriate product. This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD.","['Augmented reality', 'Virtual reality', 'Assembly', 'Disassembly', 'Object mapping']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2023,Journal,"['Eswaran, M.', 'Raju Bahubalendruni, M.V.A.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109663
An analytical framework for assessing cognitive capacity and processing speed of operators in industry 4.0,"The fourth industrial revolution introduced a new paradigm in manufacturing systems. The digital network is at the basis of the smart manufacturing and the physical context is strictly related to the artificial intelligence. This new manufacturing context drastically changed the role of the operator since the increasing adoption of innovative devices in manufacturing process modified the work activities and the operator is employed in more cognitive than physical tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this paper consists in developing an analytical framework to assess the human cognitive capacity occupancy and the human processing time of correct information known as the quality performance. The analytical framework presented allows to assess the human mental workload imposed by the task and how the processing speed of correct information changes when quality performance varies.","['human cognitive capacity occupancy', 'mental workload', 'human information processing speed', 'smart production system']",Procedia Computer Science,2021,Journal,"['Cavallo, Daniela', 'Digiesi, Salvatore', 'Facchini, Francesco', 'Mummolo, Giovanni']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.01.169
Exploring augmented reality for worker assistance versus training,"This paper aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of the affordances of Augmented Reality (AR) as a workplace-based learning and training technology in supporting manual or semi-automated manufacturing tasks that involve both complex manipulation and reasoning. Between-subject laboratory experiments involving 20 participants are conducted on a real-life electro-mechanical assembly task to investigate the impacts of various modes of information delivery through AR compared to traditional training methods on task efficiency, number of errors, learning, independence, and cognitive load. The AR application is developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed. Several insights drawn from the experiments and expert interviews are discussed to inform the design of future AR technologies for both training and assisting incumbent and future manufacturing workers on complex manipulation and reasoning tasks.","['Augmented reality', 'Electro-mechanical assembly', 'Workforce training', 'Workplace-based learning']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2021,Journal,"['Moghaddam, Mohsen', 'Wilson, Nicholas C.', 'Modestino, Alicia Sasser', 'Jona, Kemi', 'Marsella, Stacy C.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2021.101410

A cognitive load (CL) assessment procedure is developed using fuzzy logic inference across the dimensions of attention, memory, language, math, logic, and reading. A case study evaluates the effectiveness of RL in assisting assembly tasks. Different error-handling scenarios are compared.

Co2iAR: Co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative industrial AR wiring harness assembly,"Abstract Existing augmented reality (AR) assembly mainly provides visual instructions for operators from a first-person perspective, and it is hard to share individual working intents for co-located workers on the shop floor, especially for large-scale product assembly task that requires multiple operators working together. To bridge this gap for practical deployments, this paper proposes Co2iAR, a co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative AR assembly. Firstly, according to the stereo visual-inertial fusion strategy, robust and accurate self-contained motion tracking is achieved for the resource-constrained mobile AR platform, followed by a co-located alignment from multiple mobile AR clients on the shop floor. Then, a lightweight text-aware network for online wiring harness character recognition is proposed, as well as the audio-based confirming strategy, enabling natural audio-visual interaction among co-located workers within a shared immersive workplace, which can also monitor the current wiring assembly status and activate the step-by-step tutorials automatically. The novelty of this work is focused on the deployment of audio-visual aware interaction using the same device that is being used to deploy the co-located collaborative AR work instructions, establishing shared operating intents among multiple co-located workers. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on the collaborative performance among multiple AR clients, and results illustrate that the proposed Co2iAR can alleviate the cognitive load and achieve superior performance for the co-located AR assembly tasks, providing a more human-centric collaborative assembly performance.","['Augmented reality', 'audio-visual interaction', 'co-located AR', 'collaborative assembly']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2024,Journal,"['Fang, Wei', 'Chen, Lixi', 'Zhang, Tienong', 'Hu, Hao', 'Bi, Jiapeng']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2024.102795
A human-centered perspective in repetitive assembly processes: preliminary investigation of cognitive support of collaborative robots,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is one of the paradigms of the emerging Industry 5.0, aimed at supporting humans in production processes. However, the introduction of an industrial robotic system in close contact with a human opens new challenges not only for safety but also for ergonomics. This paper aims to study whether the introduction of a collaborative robot into an assembly process can support the human operator not only physically but also cognitively. To address this research question, shifts of a repetitive assembly process were implemented in both manual and HRC settings. The two settings were compared over time by analyzing the evolution of generated process failures and physiological response, revealing potential differences in process quality and operator stress.","['Human robot collaboration', 'Cognitive ergonomics', 'Physiological response']",Procedia Computer Science,2024,Journal,"['Gervasi, Riccardo', 'Capponi, Matteo', 'Antonelli, Dario', 'Mastrogiacomo, Luca', 'Franceschini, Fiorenzo']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.02.044
Complexity based investigation in collaborative assembly scenarios via non intrusive techniques,"Human and robot collaboration in assembly tasks is an integral part in modern manufactories. Robots provide advantages in both process and productivity with their repeatability and usability in different tasks, while human operators provide flexibility and can act as safeguards. However, process complexity increases which can lower the overall quality. Increased complexity can negatively influence decision making due to cognitive load on human operators, which can lead to lower quality, be it product, process or human work. Moreover, it can lead to safety risks, human-system error and accidents. In this work, we present the preliminary results on an experiment performed with student-participants, based on an assembly task. The experiment was set up to emulate an industrial assembly, and data collection was performed through qualitative and non-intrusive quantitative methods. Questionnaires were used to assess perceptual task complexity and cognitive load, while a stereo camera provided recordings for after-task analysis on process errors and human work quality based on a 3D skeleton-based human pose estimation and tracking method. The aim of the study is to investigate causes of errors and implications on quality. Future direction of the work is discussed.","['collaboration', 'assembly task', 'complexity', 'cognitive load', 'human pose estimation', 'tracking']",Procedia Computer Science,2023,Journal,"['Panagou, Sotirios', 'Sileo, Monica', 'Papoutsakis, Konstantinos', 'Fruggiero, Fabio', 'Qammaz, Ammar', 'Argyros, Antonis']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.243
Combining Simulation and Augmented Reality Methods for Enhanced Worker Assistance in Manual Assembly,"Due to mass customization product variety increased steeply in the automotive industry, entailing the increment of worker’s cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Although worker assistance methods for cognitive automation already exist, they proof insufficient in terms of usability and achieved time saving. Given the rising importance of simulation towards autonomous production planning, a novel approach is proposed using human simulation data in context of worker assistance methods to alleviate cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Within this paper, a new concept for augmented reality-based worker assistance is presented. Additionally, a comparative user study (N=24) was conducted with conventional worker assistance methods to evaluate a prototypical implementation of the concept. The results illustrate the enhancing opportunity of the novel approach to save cognitive abilities and to induce performance improvements. The implementation provided stable information presentation during the entire experiment. However, with regard to the recentness, there has to be carried out further developments and research, concerning performance adaptions and investigations of the effectiveness.","['augmented reality', 'assistance methods', 'assembly', 'human simulation', 'dynamic instructions']",Procedia CIRP,2019,Journal,"['Lampen, Eva', 'Teuber, Jonas', 'Gaisbauer, Felix', 'Bär, Thomas', 'Pfeiffer, Thies', 'Wachsmuth, Sven']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2019.03.160
An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Industrial Tasks,"The ongoing trend toward Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary workplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production chain. Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing the operator’s physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator’s performance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for online assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate the workers’ attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers’ mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics in manufacturing.","['Cognitive ergonomics', 'Cognitive manufacturing', 'Assembly', 'Attention estimation', 'Stress detection']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2022,Journal,"['Lagomarsino, Marta', 'Lorenzini, Marta', 'De Momi, Elena', 'Ajoudani, Arash']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102380
Multi-assistance systems in manufacturing - a user study evaluating multi-criteria impact in a high-mix low-volume assembly setting,"Understanding how skilled workers interact with assistance systems in manufacturing and how they experience the factory environment is fundamental to modeling human interaction and optimizing the processes correctly. This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners’ evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multi-criteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human–machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems.","['User study', 'Multi-criteria evaluation', 'Assistance systems', 'Manufacturing', 'Human factors']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2023,Journal,"['Zigart, Tanja', 'Zafari, Setareh', 'Stürzl, Felix', 'Kiesewetter, Robert', 'Kasparick, Hans-Peter', 'Schlund, Sebastian']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109674
Cognitive Human Modeling in Collaborative Robotics,"In today’s INDUSTRY 4.0 context, the growing need to improve performances and sustainability of working environment is looking forward to developing interoperable and service-oriented systems with real time capabilities. This is boosting the installation of decentralized and reliable robotics cells with flexible cooperative capabilities. They enroll smart operators’flexibility and robot productivity in collaborative robotics (properly cobots) applications.

AR/VR assisted integrated framework of autonomous disassembly system for industrial products,"An immersive Augmented Reality (AR) technology enhances productivity and flexibility in manufacturing by providing real-time instructions within workers’ field of view, aiding in complex tasks. According to cognitive load and attention-based theories, AR guidance can reduce cognitive strain, enhancing task performance. The affordance of AR in industrial processes like assembly or disassembly for repair/maintenance has been exploited broadly. However, the prevailing studies on automated user interfaces for AR instruction development, specifically virtual scene creation and target generation for object mapping rendering, still need to be explored. Notably, production industries currently rely on outsourcing skilled professionals to create AR overlaying instructions using manufacturer input. However, the exactness of the disassembly repository is substantial to avoid defects in AR guidance particulars. This underscores the significance of generalized automated AR instruction development and emphasizes the demands for further research. In this work, the autonomous AR-integrated framework is developed for the disassembly context, empowering manufacturers to acquire desired outcomes across various modules. These modules include the validation of the manual user disassembly sequence repository during the prefatory phase of AR instruction creation and the provision of Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) input. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation/rendering of disassembly efforts in a virtual platform and the generation of rendering virtual display scenes for appropriate AR-guided object mapping. Furthermore, it enables the generation of essential model targets for registering the AR scenes. Subsequently, the extracted repositories (virtual scenes and model targets) are input into the Unity AR tool to create AR mapping guidance for disassembly operations. The performance of the autonomous disassembly module is evaluated through three case studies with different AR visualizations. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed framework is exploited by extracting feedback from experts regarding flexibility, compatibility, completion time, and cognitive level.","['Augmented reality', 'AR object mapping', 'Disassembly sequence', 'Virtual reality', 'Automated AR scene extraction']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2024,Journal,"['M., Eswaran', 'Bahubalendruni, M.V.A.

Outlook on human-centric manufacturing towards Industry 5.0,"The recent shift to wellbeing, sustainability, and resilience under Industry 5.0 has prompted formal discussions that manufacturing should be human-centric – placing the wellbeing of industry workers at the center of manufacturing processes, instead of system-centric – only driven by efficiency and quality improvement and cost reduction. However, there is a lack of shared understanding of the essence of human-centric manufacturing, though significant research efforts exist in enhancing the physical and cognitive wellbeing of operators. Therefore, this position paper presents our arguments on the concept, needs, reference model, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-centric manufacturing, providing a relatable vision and research agenda for future work in human-centric manufacturing systems. We believe human-centric manufacturing should ultimately address human needs defined in an Industrial Human Needs Pyramid – from basic needs of safety and health to the highest level of esteem and self-actualization. In parallel, human-machine relationships will change following a 5C evolution map – from current Coexistence, Cooperation and Collaboration to future Compassion and Coevolution. As such, human-centric manufacturing systems need to have bi-directional empathy, proactive communication and collaborative intelligence for establishing trustworthy human-machine coevolution relationships, thereby leading to high-performance human-machine teams. It is suggested that future research focus should be on developing transparent, trustworthy and quantifiable technologies that provide a rewarding working environment driven by real-world needs.","['Human-centric manufacturing', 'Industry 5.0', 'Industrial Human Needs Pyramid', 'Self-organizing manufacturing', 'Human-machine relationship', 'Human-centric human-robot collaboration']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,"['Lu, Yuqian', 'Zheng, Hao', 'Chand, Saahil', 'Xia, Wanqing', 'Liu, Zengkun', 'Xu, Xun', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Qin, Zhaojun', 'Bao, Jinsong']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.02.001
Managing Human Errors: Augmented Reality systems as a tool in the quality journey,"The manufacturing industry is shifting, entering a new era with smart and connected devices. The fourth industrial revolution is promising increased growth and productivity by the Smart Factory and within the enabling technologies is Augmented Reality (AR). At the same time as the technology is introduced, errors in manufacturing are a problem which is affecting the productivity and the quality. This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation- reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems. Furthermore, the empirical findings showed that for managing human errors, the main bottleneck of an AR system is the systems artificial intelligence capabilities.","['Industry 4.0', 'smart factory', 'Augmented Reality', 'human error', 'artificial intelligence']",Procedia Manufacturing,2019,Journal,"['Qeshmy, Danial Etemady', 'Makdisi, Jacob', 'Ribeiro da Silva, Elias Hans Dener', 'Angelis, Jannis']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2018.12.005
Ontology-based Digital Twin for maintenance decisions in manufacturing systems: an application at laboratory scale,"In the Industry 4.0 environment, the maintenance of industrial assets is of increasing importance, and, in this domain, the recently emerged technology of Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) is particularly suitable for the satisfaction of today’s manufacturers’ needs for flexibility, dynamism, broad vision of the systems, and responsiveness to stimuli. Although this technology shows considerable potential in supporting the execution of maintenance applications with minimum human intervention, in most cases the to-date technological level is not capable of achieving full automation, making the human role still fundamental in relation to the existing Digital Twin (DT) technologies. In this context, this paper proposes the development of an ontology-based DT aiming at supporting the maintenance fault diagnosis decision-making process in manufacturing systems through the synergistic exploitation of the maintenance ontology KARMA supported by algorithms and database technologies integrated with human knowledge.

It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers’ performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces.","['Augmented reality', 'Maintenance', 'Blind area', 'Occlusion', 'Work instructions', 'Industrial operator support']",Computers in Industry,2023,Journal,"['Laviola, Enricoandrea', 'Gattullo, Michele', 'Evangelista, Alessandro', 'Fiorentino, Michele', 'Uva, Antonio Emmanuele']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2022.103795
Comparison of concurrent cognitive load measures during n-back tasks,"The cognitive load experienced by humans is an important factor affecting their performance. Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load.","['Cognitive load', 'Eye-tracking', 'Pupil diameter', 'Detection response task', 'Human-computer interface']",Applied Ergonomics,2024,Journal,"['Pillai, Prarthana', 'Balasingam, Balakumar', 'Jaekel, Arunita', 'Biondi, Francesco N.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104244
Eye-Tracking supported design of digital assistance systems for smart factories,"Cognitive assistance systems enable people to receive valuable support in their industrial work tasks and can offer the highest flexibility and individualization possibilities. The increasing need for knowledge and its growing importance lead to a great demand for user-centric cognitive assistance systems. In this sense, eye-tracking is a potential technology to provide better insights in Use behavior in the task fulfillment process. The analysis of the data contributes to understand where the person is directing their attention, how long they are looking at certain areas and whether potentially unnecessary distractions exist. In this way, data-based adjustments can be specifically identified to be able to increase reliability and efficiency in the process. EyeTracking is rarely used in the development of assistance systems for the manufacturing industry. The expected benefit and the effort remain unclear. We show what potential it can offer in the development of cognitive assistance systems and present recommendations for its integration in the design process. The results are based on the empirical findings of a manual industrial application of complex quality measurement of battery module housings for electric vehicles.","['Eye-Tacking', 'Human-centred design', 'Design methodology', 'Tools', 'technologies']",Procedia CIRP,2024,Journal,"['Gelec, Erdem', 'Lindenlaub, Stefan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2024.07.046
Changes and improvements in Industry 5.0: A strategic approach to overcome the challenges of Industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 has introduced new technological advances such as Additive Manufacturing (AM), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber–physical systems (CPS), Blockchain, Cybersecurity and many more. It is also helping organisations to take on challenges like demand fluctuations and market volatility. Industry 4.0 is also the interconnection of computers, materials, and AI with minimal human intervention in decision-making. Although Industry 4.0 has tremendous potential for industrial growth, it has many challenges, such as technical integration, human resource issue, supply chain issues and data security. These challenges are expected to be addressed in the future by Industry 5.0 Industry 5.0 introduced various new technologies such as Predictive maintenance, Hyper customisation in the Industry, Cyber–Physical Cognitive systems, and the introduction of Collaborative Robots. Industry 5.0, with its human-centric approach, helped overcome the various challenges of Industry 4.0. In Industry 4.0, the focus was on sustainability and production volume, whereas in Industry 5.0, the primary focus is on human centricity. This paper’s literature review has been done by considering the findings and results discussed in various latest literature. We have listed various technological developments in Industry 5.0 and the advancements to the technologies of Industry 4.0. Industry 5.0 has tackled various issues faced in Industry 4.0, such as data privacy and technical integration issues. Resilience is also one of the critical aspects of Industry 5.0, which contributed towards hyper individualisation and helped make individualised products with specific user needs. This study would provide a base for the researchers and industries to get acquainted with Industry 4.0 technologies, their challenges, the technological advances, and the ways Industry 5.0 overcame the challenges of Industry 4.0. This paper also lists the recent application of these technologies, which would provide an idea of how these technologies can be implemented.

Human-machine interface in smart factory: A systematic literature review,"A smart factory is a form of manufacturing in the era of Industry 4.0 that has adopted new integrated manufacturing technologies. The importance of human–machine interfaces (HMIs) has been increasing due to the complexity of the current manufacturing context. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and understand HMIs in smart factories from a holistic perspective, which enables us to understand the overall picture. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of HMIs to identify smart factory functions, tasks, information types, interaction modalities, and their impact on human operators from the perspectives of human factors and human–computer interaction. Seventy-seven articles were selected for SLR and analysed based on three research questions. We found four smart factory functions (operation and supervision, management, maintenance service, and cybersecurity) consisting of 18 tasks, including subtasks and functions. The effects of these functions, tasks, and HMIs on human operators are also discussed. Five interaction modalities (gaze, voice, gesture, tactile, and haptic) were used to perform these functions and tasks. This paper also discusses the practical use context of HMIs in smart factories and offers HMI recommendations for users, designers, and researchers. These findings provide insights into the design of HMIs in smart factories.","['Smart factory', 'Industry 4.0', 'Human-machine interface,', 'Human factors', 'Human-computer interaction', 'Human operator']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2022,Journal,"['Kumar, Naveen', 'Lee, Seul Chan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121284
Neurobehavioral assessment of force feedback simulation in industrial robotic teleoperation,"Telerobotic operation, i.e., a human operator to manipulate remote robotic systems at a distance, has started to gain its popularity in the construction industry. It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye-tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages.","['Human-robot collaboration', 'Teleoperation', 'Force feedback', 'Virtual reality', 'fNIRS', 'Neurophysiological analysis']",Automation in Construction,2021,Journal,"['Zhu, Qi', 'Du, Jing', 'Shi, Yangming', 'Wei, Paul']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103674
Countering the forgetting effect in mixed-model manual assembly,"At present, manufacturing companies are increasingly feeling the need to respond rapidly on the changing customer demands. Mass customization was introduced in order to meet the market’s needs. A direct result of the change in manufacturing strategy is an increase of the complexity for manual assembly operators. Due to a large variety of assembly tasks, the operator is cognitively challenged because he is not supposed to perform every task evenly frequently. This causes an unlearning phase in which the operator’s cycle time increases. Some important learning forgetting models are discussed in this paper to get insights in the phenomenon. Furthermore, different counter strategies against the forgetting effect are listed and discussed. Opportunities and limitations of the strategies were pointed out. An approach for estimating the optimal conditions for retraining is described. A new learning forgetting estimation curve that focuses on mixed-model assembly lines must be introduced. The development of this curve must take into account the task similarity of the product mix and the impact on operator learning and forgetting. Using this estimation, optimal conditions for counter strategies can be proposed. The authors suggest that an experimental study should be used to evaluate the outcome of this approach.","['Forgetting effect', 'Manual assembly', 'Mixed-model', 'Retraining']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2018,Journal,"['Hoedt, S.', 'Claeys, A.', 'Schamp, M.', 'Landeghem, H.

Augmented reality for industrial quality inspection: An experiment assessing task performance and human factors,"Augmented reality (AR) technologies promise to increase the flexibility and productivity of the workforce by providing real-time information to workers right where it is needed. Following Cognitive Load Theory and Attention Theory, AR assistance can reduce the burden on workers’ mental capacity while performing a task, thereby improving task performance. The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors.","['Augmented reality', 'Quality inspection', 'Manufacturing', 'Experiment', 'Head-mounted display', 'Cognitive load']",Computers in Industry,2023,Journal,"['Seeliger, Arne', 'Cheng, Long', 'Netland, Torbjørn']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2023.103985
Investigating the productivity in different assembly system configurations for a better inclusion of disabled workers,"One of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is focused on decent work and growth which aims to reduce and, finally, remove all barriers for people with a form of diversity like disability. In such a context, manufacturing and production systems should be adapted by adopting specific equipment to help workers with disability while executing jobs according to the type of disability they report. Jobs must be properly planned since disabled workers have physical or cognitive disabilities and specific rights to work. Further, aiming to guarantee a real inclusion of workers with disability production systems should be designed to include these workers in the same working environment as workers without disability. This paper focuses on assembly systems, and it aims to investigate how different designs could impact both the productivity and inclusion of disabled workers. Then, due to the higher variety of products belonging to the same family mixed model assembly systems are considered. For each assembly system design, the daily productivity is calculated by using a simulation approach. Finally, according to the obtained results we provide some considerations about the convenience of adopting parallel flows to guarantee higher inclusion without affecting too much the productivity of the assembly system.","['Assembly systems', 'productivity', 'social sustainability', 'diversity', 'human factors']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2024,Journal,"['Finco, Serena', 'Neumann, W.

An AR-assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning-based approach towards mutual-cognitive safe human-robot interaction,"With the emergence of Industry 5.0, the human-centric manufacturing paradigm requires manufacturing equipment (robots, etc.) interactively assist human workers to deal with dynamic and complex production tasks. To achieve symbiotic human–robot interaction (HRI), the safety issue serves as a prerequisite foundation. Regarding the growing individualized demand of manufacturing tasks, the conventional rule-based safe HRI measures could not well address the safety requirements due to inflexibility and lacking synergy. To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview and collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene.","['Smart manufacturing', 'Human robot interaction', 'Augmented reality', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Manufacturing safety']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,"['Li, Chengxi', 'Zheng, Pai', 'Yin, Yue', 'Pang, Yat Ming', 'Huo, Shengzeng']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102471
Opportunities for using eye tracking technology in manufacturing and logistics: Systematic literature review and research agenda,"Workers play essential roles in manufacturing and logistics. Releasing workers from routine tasks and enabling them to focus on creative, value-adding activities can enhance their performance and wellbeing, and it is also key to the successful implementation of Industry 4.0. One technology that can help identify patterns of worker-system interaction is Eye Tracking (ET), which is a non-intrusive technology for measuring human eye movements. ET can provide moment-by-moment insights into the cognitive state of the subject during task execution, which can improve our understanding of how humans behave and make decisions within complex systems. It also enables explorations of the subject’s interaction mode with the working environment. Earlier research has investigated the use of ET in manufacturing and logistics, but the literature is fragmented and has not yet been discussed in a literature review yet. This article therefore conducts a systematic literature review to explore the applications of ET, summarise its benefits, and outline future research opportunities of using ET in manufacturing and logistics. We first propose a conceptual framework to guide our study and then conduct a systematic literature search in scholarly databases, obtaining 71 relevant papers. Building on the proposed framework, we systematically review the use of ET and categorize the identified papers according to their application in manufacturing (product development, production, quality inspection) and logistics. Our results reveal that ET has several use cases in the manufacturing sector, but that its application in logistics has not been studied extensively so far. We summarize the benefits of using ET in terms of process performance, human performance, and work environment and safety, and also discuss the methodological characteristics of the ET literature as well as typical ET measures used. We conclude by illustrating future avenues for ET research in manufacturing and logistics.","['Eye tracking', 'Literature review', 'Manufacturing', 'Logistics', 'Human behaviour', 'Industry 4.0']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,"['Zheng, Ting', 'Glock, Christoph H.', 'Grosse, Eric H.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.108444
A vision-enabled fatigue-sensitive human digital twin towards human-centric human-robot collaboration,"Within a Human-centric Human-Robot Collaboration (HHRC) system, monitoring, assessing, and optimizing for an operator’s well-being is essential to creating an efficient and comfortable working environment. Currently, monitoring systems are used for independent assessment of human factors. However, the rise of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) has provided the framework for synchronizing multiple operator well-being assessments to create a comprehensive understanding of the operator’s performance and health. Within manufacturing, an operator’s dynamic well-being can be attributed to their physical and cognitive fatigue across the assembly process. As such, we apply non-invasive video understanding techniques to extract relevant assembly process information for automatic physical fatigue assessment. Our novelty involves a video-based fatigue estimation method, in which the boundary-aware dual-stream MS-TCN combined with an LSTM is proposed to detect the operation type, operation repetitions, and the target arm performing each task in an assembly process video. The detected results are then input into our physical fatigue profile to automatically assess the operator’s localized physical fatigue impact. The assembly process of a real-world bookshelf is recorded and tested against, with our algorithm results showing superiority in operation segmentation and target arm detection as opposed to other recent action segmentation models. In addition, we integrate a cognitive fatigue assessment tool that captures operator physiological signals in real-time for body response detection caused by stress. This provides a more robust HDT of the operator for an HHRC system.","['Human-centric manufacturing', 'Human-robot collaboration', 'Vision-based operation segmentation', 'Fatigue assessment', 'Ergonomics', 'Human digital twin']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2024,Journal,"['Chand, Saahil', 'Zheng, Hao', 'Lu, Yuqian']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2024.10.002
Dynamic Scene Graph for Mutual-Cognition Generation in Proactive Human-Robot Collaboration,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) plays a crucial role in agile, flexible, and human-centric manufacturing towards the mass personalization transition. Nevertheless, in today’s HRC tasks, either humans or robots need to follow the partners’ commands and instructions along collaborative activities progressing, instead of proactive, mutual engagement. The non-semantic perception of HRC scenarios impedes mutually needed, proactive planning and high-cognitive capabilities in existing HRC systems. To overcome the bottleneck, this research explores a dynamic scene graph-based method for mutual-cognition generation in Proactive HRC applications. Firstly, a spatial-attention object detector is utilized to dynamically perceive objects in industrial settings. Secondly, a linking prediction module is leveraged to construct HRC scene graphs. An attentional graph convolutional network (GCN) is utilized to capture relations between industrial parts, human operators, and robot operations and reason structural connections of human-robot collaborative processing as graph embedding, which links to mutual planners for human operation supports and robot proactive instructions. Lastly, the Proactive HRC implementation is demonstrated on disassembly tasks of aging electronic vehicle batteries (EVBs) and evaluate its mutual-cognition capabilities.","['Cognitive computing', 'scene graph', 'human-robot collaboration', 'human-centric manufacturing']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Li, Shufei', 'Zheng, Pai', 'Wang, Zuoxu', 'Fan, Junming', 'Wang, Lihui']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.089
Systematic selection methodology for worker assistance systems in manufacturing,"The transformation process of the industry into a more digitized world is a key challenge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. On the one hand, the advantages of new technologies must be used profitably, on the other hand, the workforce needs to be prepared to deal with new technologies and the complexity and speed that the today's production entails. Worker assistance systems offer the possibility to simplify the interaction between humans and complex machines and to reinforce physical and cognitive skills of employees. Although, worker assistance systems are available on the market, methods, focusing on the systematic selection of appropriate worker assistance systems for specific work tasks and worker types are missing. This paper presents a novel and systematic selection methodology, to analyze and evaluate the workplace, the employee, and the respective work task, based on previously defined parameters. An innovative selection algorithm enables a ranking of potential useful worker assistance systems. Therefore, the proposed novel selection methodology not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge, but also proves to be a helpful tool for practitioners in selecting the right assistance system for both, human workers, and manufacturing operations.","['Industry 4.0', 'Smart manufacturing', 'Assistance systems', 'Methodology', 'Operator 4.0', 'Systematic selection']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2022,Journal,"['Mark, Benedikt G.', 'Rauch, Erwin', 'Matt, Dominik T.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2022.107982
Artificial cognitive control with self-x capabilities: A case study of a micro-manufacturing process,"Nowadays, even though cognitive control architectures form an important area of research, there are many constraints on the broad application of cognitive control at an industrial level and very few systematic approaches truly inspired by biological processes, from the perspective of control engineering. Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept. The proof of concept of force control yields good transient responses, short settling times and acceptable steady-state error. The artificial cognitive control architecture built into a low-cost computing platform demonstrates the suitability of its implementation in an industrial setup.","['Cognitive control', 'Industrial application', 'Micro manufacturing process']",Computers in Industry,2015,Journal,"['Haber, Rodolfo E.', 'Juanes, Carmelo', 'del Toro, Raúl', 'Beruvides, Gerardo']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2015.05.001
Emerging architecture for heterogeneous smart cyber-physical systems for industry 5.0,"Industrial process automation is becoming more advance due to the new technological revolutions like Industrial Internet of things (IIoT), Machine to Machine Communication (M2M), cloud computing, cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and big little multicore-based ARM processors for embedded applications. Modern IP-enabled sensors, actuators, and controllers are transforming industrial automation into industry 5.0 compliances to attain full autonomy with minimal human intervention. With these emerging technologies, Smart Cyber-Physical System (SCPS) is the most important part of the fourth industrial revolution, where diffident programmed embedded systems are networked together to perform, computation, communication, control, and actuation. In this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous architecture for SCPS, where different electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes can be integrated to execute hybrid process dynamics. The proposed architecture is enabled to separate all aspects like computation, control, communication, and actuation, of a process dynamic by estimating the process disturbances, sensor delay, actuator delay, and conversion delay. The allotment of computational embedded cores to different physical processes is done through voltage frequency islands (VFI) with high modularity which is different for different processes. All the mapped process dynamics are optimized through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). The best implementation of the proposed architecture is the upcoming era of industry 5.0 where human intervention is also in a fold in various industries like petroleum, fertilizer, paper, cement, space exploration, and automobile manufacturing.","['Cyber-physical systems', 'Design automation', 'System synchronization', 'DVFS control']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2021,Journal,"['Thakur, Payal', 'Kumar Sehgal, Vivek']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2021.107750
RHYTHMS: Real-time Data-driven Human-machine Synchronization for Proactive Ergonomic Risk Mitigation in the Context of Industry 4.0 and Beyond,"Human-machine work system (HMWS) represents a composite system that integrates machine precision and strength with human cognitive abilities, flexibility, and adaptability, aiming to achieve enhanced performance in various tasks aligned with a common goal, which is getting smarter in the era of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and has received extensive attention from academia and industry. However, the lack of real-time information sharing during HMWS implementation and operation, coupled with uncertainties stemming from human instability and the complexities introduced by smart networking environments in the context of I4.0, poses challenges to the synchronous coordination of this distributed human-centric manufacturing system. Failure in synchronization not only compromises overall system integrity, leading to unrealistic decision-making and potential harm to human health but also goes against the principles of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which proposes placing human well-being at the center of the production process for human-centric smart manufacturing in the future. In this context, this research presents real-time data-driven hyper objects orchestrating for the human-machine synchronization (RHYTHMS) based on a service-oriented human-to-machine architecture (SOH2M) and a model reference adaptive fuzzy control for real-time information sharing and synchronous coordination of the smart HMWS.

ODIN architecture enabling reconfigurable human – robot based production lines,"Over the last decades, a significant effort has been allocated by the research community towards improving robot capabilities. These emerged robot cognitive and perception abilities have been driving the swift of production paradigm from rigid automation systems to hybrid and collaborative working environments. Nevertheless, the adoption of robots in lower volume, diverse manufacturing environments is still constrained, due to a) the high integration and deployment complexity of end-to-end integrated robotic applications, b) the limited flexibility of existing solutions in dealing with unexpected events in a dynamic way. This paper presents a modular service-oriented architecture for robotic resources that aims to address those limitations by a) creating digital models, semantically characterizing all production entities and processes in a unified way, b) deploy open interfaces allowing the communication of all robotics hardware and control systems, c) dynamically plan and orchestrate manufacturing operations execution by the involved human and robot resources, and d) collectively share the resources’ perceived environment.

Deep learning based robot cognitive architecture for collaborative assembly tasks,"As the manufacturing industry becomes more agile, the use of collaborative robots capable of safely working with humans is becoming more prevalent, while adaptable and natural interaction is a goal yet to be achieved. This work presents a cognitive architecture composed of perception and reasoning modules that allows a robot to adapt its actions while collaborating with humans in an assembly task. Human action recognition perception is performed using convolutional neural network models with inertial measurement unit and skeleton tracking data. The action predictions are used for task status reasoning which predicts the time left for each action in a task allowing a robot to plan future actions. The task status reasoning uses a recurrent neural network method which is developed for transferability to new actions and tasks. Updateable input parameters allowing the system to optimise for each user and task with each trial performed are also investigated. Finally, the complete system is demonstrated with the collaborative assembly of a small chair and wooden box, along with a solo robot task of stacking objects performed when it would otherwise be idle. The human actions recognised are using a screw driver, Allen key, hammer and hand screwing, with online accuracies between 83–92%. User trials demonstrate the robot deciding when to start collaborative actions in order to synchronise with the user, as well as deciding when it has time to complete an action on its solo task before a collaborative action is required.","['Human–robot collaboration', 'Deep learning', 'Industry 4.0', 'Human action recognition']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,"['Male, James', 'Martinez-Hernandez, Uriel']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102572

This paper calls for a holistic understanding of the changing role and responsibilities of workers in the O&G industry and aims at investigating to what extent, what type of, and how academic publications in the O&G field integrate HF/E and Industry 4.0 in their research. Bibliometric analysis has been conducted to provide useful insights to researchers and practitioners and to assess the status quo. Our findings show that academic publications have mainly focused on simulation-based training to increase process safety whereas revealed the lack of specific studies on the application of cognitive solutions, such as Augmented Reality-enabled tools or Intelligent Fault Detection and Alarm Management solutions.","['Human factor engineering', 'Oil', 'gas industry', 'Bibliometric analysis', 'Industry 4.0', 'Ergonomics']",Procedia Computer Science,2021,Journal,"['Longo, Francesco', 'Padovano, Antonio', 'Gazzaneo, Lucia', 'Frangella, Jessica', 'Diaz, Rafael']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2021.01.350
Cognitive analytics platform with AI solutions for anomaly detection,"This work presents a cognitive analytics platform for anomaly detection which is capable to handle, analyze and exploit resourcefully machine data from a shop-floor of factory, so as to support the emerging and growing needs of manufacturing industry. The introduced system contributes to industrial digitization and creation of smart factories by providing a generic platform which is a complete solution supporting standards-based factory connectivity, data management, various AI models training and comparisons, live predictions and real-time visualizations. The proposed system is built on a micro-service architecture, in order to be extendable and adaptive over time, and contains three core modules, the Data Acquisition, the Knowledge Management and the Predictive maintenance, which contribute to machine failure prediction and activate predictive maintenance procedures, to efficient production schemes and decision making, to monitor anomalies and handle unforeseen conditions, to predict future behaviours on time series etc. The proposed platform utilizes continuous re-training mechanisms enabling a self learning approach for the delivery of AI solutions, usable also for various production data, guaranteeing the quality of results without continuous monitoring and human-resources allocation for AI models’ retraining.

Improving manufacturing productivity by combining cognitive engineering and lean-six sigma methods.,"Increasing automation of manufacturing has changed the relationship between workers and the technology employed to get work done. Cognitive work is replacing manual labour. Established productivity improvement methods need to comprehend increased complexity, less tractable processes and a workforce where expertise is a differentiator of outcomes. This paper describes how human factors and cognitive engineering methods can be combined with Lean - Six Sigma to create an enhanced productivity framework for complex manufacturing. Action research over a three-month period is used to validate its effectiveness recording the cognitive work of engineers engaged in a quality control task.","['Cognitive work', 'Knowledge work', 'Lean Manufacturing', 'Six Sigma', 'Productivity']",Procedia CIRP,2019,Journal,"['Gleeson, Frank', 'Coughlan, Paul', 'Goodman, Lizbeth', 'Newell, Anthony', 'Hargaden, Vincent']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2019.03.169
Deliberative robotics – a novel interactive control framework enhancing human-robot collaboration,"Deliberative robots adapt their behavior from cobot to industrial arms as a result of the interaction dynamic with the human teammates and production context. This powerful capability is instrumental to boost robots' adoption within typically manual manufacturing contexts, by enhancing productivity while preserving human safety and job quality. The deliberative feature relies upon a modular planning and control infrastructure linked to a behavioral tree framework determining the robot response to the operating context and the human physical and cognitive status. The benefits of the approach have been validated through an industrial use case demanding enhanced human-robot collaboration in the electronics assembly value chain.","['Deliberative control', 'Human-robot collaboration', 'Human safety']",CIRP Annals,2022,Journal,"['Valente, A.', 'Pavesi, G.', 'Zamboni, M.', 'Carpanzano, E.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cirp.2022.03.045
A framework for human-centered production planning and control in smart manufacturing,"Smart manufacturing systems have to meet high performance expectations in form of customer individual products, short lead times, high due date reliability and resilience by the integration of new technologies and by intelligent process design. The planning and control of such smart manufacturing systems necessitates several instances of human decision-making. The latest research at the nexus of operations management and psychology reveals that human decision-making in such fast-paced, dynamic and complex environments is often biased, resulting in suboptimal operational performance. Human-centered design of planning and control processes can mitigate biased decisions, thus boosting performance in smart manufacturing systems. Current research is silent about the impact and mitigation of cognitive biases in operations management, though. We intend to close this research gap. We combine systematic reviews of literature on behavioral operations management and cognitive biases in operations management, particularly in production planning and control with an in-depth case study based on 12 expert interviews. We explore two decision-making models and combine them in a PPC framework. We create a framework for human-centered PPC in smart manufacturing systems, which includes the main impact factors, challenges and performance capabilities. Based on a detailed case study of a steel producer, we present a framework of human-centered PPC comprising five hypotheses on the impact of cognitive biases on human decision-making and on manufacturing performance.","['Behavioural operations management', 'Decision types', 'Cognitive biases', 'Production planning and control', 'Smart manufacturing', 'Decision support systems']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,"['Kessler, Melanie', 'Arlinghaus, Julia C.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.09.013
Digital Human and Robot Simulation in Automotive Assembly using Siemens Process Simulate: A Feasibility Study,"The global trend toward customization in the automotive sector has led to significant increase in the variability of components available to the assembly process. The increase in product variability directly impacts the complexity of the manufacturing process and consequently increases the possibility for human-generated error. Several solutions have been offered to reduce the potential risk of error in complex assembly processes which can be generalized as cognitive-based or physical-based assistive methods. Creating a digital twin of the process, both the human and machine elements, is a preliminary requirement before deploying such solutions in a real-world manufacturing environment. The digital twin simulation provides a platform for testing a variety of solutions and what-if scenarios to improve planning and decision making. While there exist commercially available products of human digital twin modeling, these do not provide a proper platform for human – machine interaction modeling. In the context of this work, machine is defined as an industrial robot with an objective of investigating the feasibility of deploying a smart collaborative robotic solution to provide physical assistance to the human worker in a cumbersome manufacturing process. To do so, an overhead assembly operation from a real-world vehicle assembly plant is identified, and a digital twin of human model is created in Siemens Tecnomatix suite. The study starts with the simulation of various human anthropomorphic models to discover the limitations in performing the assembly tasks based on gender, weight and height. Furthermore, a digital twin of a mobile robot designed to provide physical assistance to the human to perform the assembly operation is introduced. The results are evaluated in terms of process time, joint ergonomic impact and reveal some current limitations of combined digital twin modeling of humans and robots collaborating.","['Digital twin', 'human', 'robot', 'automotive assembly', 'tecnomatix']",Procedia Manufacturing,2019,Journal,"['Baskaran, Sidharth', 'Niaki, Farbod Akhavan', 'Tomaszewski, Mark', 'Gill, Jasprit Singh', 'Chen, Yi', 'Jia, Yunyi', 'Mears, Laine', 'Krovi, Venkat']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2019.06.097
Concept and Integration of Knowledge Management in Assembly Assistance Systems,"The increasing diversity of variants and the high product complexity pose ever-greater challenges for manufacturing companies, especially in assembly. Therefore, assembly assistance systems are increasingly used to manage complexity in terms of guiding workers through assembly processes. Previous research work in this context has mainly focused on the assessment and improvement of typical assistance functions as well as their implementation. The integration of active knowledge management on both shopfloor and planning level illustrates a high potential for the extension and development of new assistance functions. However, the possibility of using informational assistance systems to implement active knowledge management in industrial assembly has not been sufficiently studied yet. Therefore, this paper firstly defines the main challenges of the integration, which are summarized in a negative cycle of knowledge management in assembly, and secondly describes the key requirements for knowledge management in conjunction with assembly assistance systems. Using these requirements, the paper finally presents a conceptual framework and the implementation in an informational assembly assistance system.","['assembly', 'assembly assistance systems', 'cognitive support', 'knowledge management', 'human-machine interaction']",Procedia CIRP,2023,Journal,"['Keiser, Dennis', 'Petzoldt, Christoph', 'Walura, Vivien', 'Leimbrink, Sebastian', 'Freitag, Michael']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.06.162
"Design, programming and orchestration of heterogeneous manufacturing systems through VR-powered remote collaboration","Modern manufacturing systems are often composed of a variety of highly customized units and specifically designed manufacturing cells. Optimization of assembly and training of staff requires a series of demo installations and excessive use of costly operational resources. In some cases, components are located at different sites, making the orchestration of the whole system even more difficult. Virtual Reality (VR) collaboration environments offer a solution by enabling high fidelity testing and training of complex manufacturing systems. On the other hand, such platforms are difficult to implement in an engineering perspective, as they are required to provide reliable, standard interfaces towards both robotic components and human operators. The VirCA (Virtual Collaboration Arena) platform is a software framework that supports various means of collaboration through the use of 3D augmented/virtual reality as a communication medium. VirCA offers functions for the high-level interoperability of heterogeneous components in a wide range of domains, spanning from research & development, through remote education to orchestration and management of industrial processes in manufacturing applications. This paper provides an overview of the industrial requirements behind high-fidelity virtual collaboration and demonstrates how the VirCA platform meets these requirements. Use cases are provided to illustrate the usability of the platform.","['Virtual reality/augmented reality', 'Mixed virtual and physical reality', 'Remote collaboration', 'Virtual commissioning', 'Future internet', 'Cognitive infocommunications']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2015,Journal,"['Galambos, Péter', 'Csapó, Ádám', 'Zentay, Péter', 'Fülöp, István Marcell', 'Haidegger, Tamás', 'Baranyi, Péter', 'Rudas, Imre J.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2014.08.012
Innovative safety zoning for collaborative robots utilizing Kinect and LiDAR sensory approaches,"Safe collaboration between a robotic and human agent is an important challenge yet to be fully overcome in a manufacturing set-up. Existing strategies, including safety zoning are sub-optimal since they seldom fully exploit the capabilities of the collaborative robot (for repetitive tasks) and highly cognitive tasks (best suited for the operator). The recently released ISO 15066 standard for collaborative robots proposes varying safeguards, including force, speed and distance limiting functions. The latter is particularly attractive as it allows the robotic agent to adapt its operating behaviour in proximity of the operator and in instances likely to lead to safety hazards. This paper discusses strategies explored for implementing dynamic zoning in shared workspaces, considering the input speed/force of the robot as dependent on the distance between human and robot. Two main strategies were modelled, for implementing zoning. The first strategy explored integrating a LiDAR sensor, and utilising LiDAR data to dynamically map the separation distances between the operator and robotic agent. The second strategy explores an experimental setup utilising the Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor for capturing 3D point clouds, and in turn, detecting objects/agents and the proximity distance. In both instances, objects/agents were detected up to a separation distance threshold, considering error sensitivity below values of 0.1 meters. Both use cases were demonstrated using a Yumi robot and form the basis of future work towards dynamic workspace zoning.","['Safety zoning', 'collaborative robots', 'dynamic separation distance', 'LiDAR sensor']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Chemweno, Peter', 'Torn, Robbert-Jan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.02.180
A theoretical framework for evaluating mental workload resources in human systems design for manufacturing operations,"As the nature of manufacturing work is changing, requiring more cognitive demands, there is a need to develop system models for measuring and predicting human performance in repetitive task operations. This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATB, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity.","['Cognitive ergonomics', 'Repetitive tasks', 'Mental workload', 'Multiple resource theory', 'Human performance modeling']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2018,Journal,"['Bommer, Sharon Claxton', 'Fendley, Mary']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2016.10.007
"Industry 4.0 vs. Industry 5.0: Co-existence, Transition, or a Hybrid","Smart manufacturing is being shaped nowadays by two different paradigms: Industry 4.0 proclaims transition to digitalization and automation of processes while emerging Industry 5.0 emphasizes human centricity. This turn can be explained by unprecedented challenges being faced recently by societies, such as, global climate change, pandemics, hybrid and conventional warfare, refugee crises. Sustainable and resilient processes require humans to get back into the loop of organizational decision-making. In this paper, we argue that the most reasonable way to marry the two extremes of automation and value-based human-driven processes is to create an Industry 4.0 + Industry 5.0 hybrid, which inherits the most valuable features of both - efficiency of the Industry 4.0 processes and sustainability of the Industry 5.0 decisions. Digital cognitive clones twinning human decision-making behavior are represented as an enabling technology for the future hybrid and as an accelerator (as well as resilience enabler) of the convergence of the digital and human worlds.","['Industry 4.0', 'Industry 5.0', 'digital clones', 'collective intelligence', 'resilience']",Procedia Computer Science,2023,Journal,"['Golovianko, Mariia', 'Terziyan, Vagan', 'Branytskyi, Vladyslav', 'Malyk, Diana']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.206
Patented intelligence: Cloning human decision models for Industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 is a trend related to smart factories, which are cyber-physical spaces populated and controlled by the collective intelligence for the autonomous and highly flexible manufacturing purposes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.","['Industry 4.0', 'Pi-Mind', 'Decision-making', 'Cyber-physical system', 'Cognitive models', 'Collective intelligence', 'Value system', 'Preference', 'Clone', 'Patented intelligence', 'Smart decision', 'Ontology']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2018,Journal,"['Terziyan, Vagan', 'Gryshko, Svitlana', 'Golovianko, Mariia']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.04.019
An end-to-end tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph for manufacturing documents,"Industrial tabular information extraction and its semantic fusion with text (ITIESF) is of great significance in converting and fusing industrial unstructured data into structured knowledge to guide cognitive intelligence analysis in the manufacturing industry. A novel end-to-end ITIESF approach is proposed to integrate tabular information and construct a tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph (TCEEKG). Specifically, an end-to-end joint learning strategy is presented to mine the semantic information in tables. The definition and modeling method of the intrinsic relationships between tables with their rows and columns in engineering documents are provided to model the tabular information. Due to this, an end-to-end joint entity relationship extraction method for textual and tabular information from engineering documents is proposed to construct text-based knowledge graphs (KG) and tabular information-based causality event evolutionary graphs (CEEG). Then, a novel NSGCN (neighborhoods sample graph convolution network)-based entity alignment is proposed to fuse the cross-knowledge graphs into a unified knowledge base. Furthermore, a translation-based graph structure-driven Q&A (question and answer) approach is designed to respond to cause analysis and problem tracing. Our models can be easily integrated into a prototype system to provide a joint information processing and cognitive analysis. Finally, the approach is evaluated by employing the aerospace machining documents to illustrate that the TCEEKG can considerably help workers strengthen their skills in the cause-and-effect analysis of machining quality issues from a global perspective.","['Engineering document', 'Table modeling', 'Knowledge graph', 'Graph embedding', 'Causality analysis']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2021,Journal,"['Zhou, Bin', 'Hua, Bao', 'Gu, Xinghai', 'Lu, Yuqian', 'Peng, Tao', 'Zheng, Yu', 'Shen, Xingwang', 'Bao, Jinsong']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2021.101441
Cognitive ergonomics-based Augmented Reality application for construction performance,"There is a growing interest in exploring the use of wearable Augmented Reality (AR) devices to improve the task performance of construction workers. However, user interaction with AR has not been well understood in the current literature, which may result in poor usability, occupational hazards, and low acceptance. To bridge this gap, this study introduced cognitive ergonomics theory to design and develop an AR application for improving the kinaesthetic performance of construction workers conducting onsite assembly tasks. The methodology of this study is three-fold. First, articles in relation to cognitive ergonomics were reviewed to propose a unique cognitive model that reveals the cognitive mechanisms of construction workers, including human information processing, selective attention, and attention resources. Second, the characteristics of existing AR application functions were synthesised to develop a customised and user-friendly wearable AR application that aligns with the identified cognitive mechanisms. Third, a rebar-tying experiment was conducted to validate the developed AR application. The results indicate that the experimenters instructed by the application can complete the task independently without the need to seek after expert assistance; the application has a potential to foster the skill development of construction workers and enhance their kinaesthetic performance; and the proposed cognitive model and the AR development principles are well aligned from the perspective of cognitive ergonomics, which could promote the uptake of wearable AR in the construction industry.","['Augmented reality', 'Cognitive ergonomics', 'Construction assembly task', 'Kinaesthetic performance']",Automation in Construction,2023,Journal,"['Wu, Shaoze', 'Hou, Lei', 'Chen, Haosen', 'Zhang, Guomin (Kevin)', 'Zou, Yang', 'Tushar, Quddus']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2023.104802
The Benefits of Human-centred Design in Industrial Practices: Re-design of Workstations in Pipe Industry,"Sustainable Manufacturing (SM) traditionally focused on optimization of environmental and economic aspects, by neglecting the human performance. However, the industrial plant's costs, productivity and process quality highly depend on the individual human performance (e.g., comfort perceived, physical and mental workload, simplicity of actions, personal satisfaction) and how much hazardous positions and uncomfortable tasks finally cost to the company. The present paper defines a human-centred virtual simulation environment to optimize physical ergonomics in workstation design and demonstrates its benefits on an industrial case study in pipe industry. The proposed environment aims at overcoming traditional approaches, where analysis are carried out at the shop-floor when the plant is already created, by providing a virtual environment to easily test and verify different design solutions to optimize physical, cognitive and organizational ergonomics.","['Human-Centred Design (HCD)', 'Manufacturing Ergonomics', 'Digital Human Models (DHM)', 'Virtual Reality', 'Workstation design']",Procedia Manufacturing,2017,Journal,"['Peruzzini, Margherita', 'Carassai, Stefano', 'Pellicciari, Marcello']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.251
Detecting cognitive hacking in visual inspection with physiological measurements,"Cyber threats are targeting vulnerabilities of human workers performing tasks in manufacturing processes, including visual inspection to bias their decision-making, thereby sabotaging product quality. This article examines the use of priming as a form of “cognitive hacking” to adversely affect quality inspection decisions in manufacturing, and investigates physiological measurements as means to detect such intrusion. In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection.","['Additive manufacturing', 'Cognitive hacking', 'Cybersecurity', 'EEG', 'Eye-tracking', 'Inspection']",Applied Ergonomics,2020,Journal,"['Huang, Wenyan', 'Chen, Xiaoyu', 'Jin, Ran', 'Lau, Nathan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103022
Designing intelligent manufacturing systems through Human-Machine Cooperation principles: A human-centered approach,"Since the start of industrialization, machine capabilities have increased in such a way that human control of processes has evolved from simple (with mechanization) to cognitive (with computerization), and even emotional (with semi/full automation). The processes have also evolved from simple to complicated, and now complex systems, in the emerging context of Industry 4.0. This is notably the case with Intelligent Manufacturing Systems in which processes have become so autonomous that humans are unaware of the processes running, while they may need to intervene to update the manufacturing plan or modify the process configuration if a machine breaks down, or to assist process-intelligent entities when they find themselves in a deadlock. This paper highlights the lack of attention paid to the correct integration of humans in Intelligent Manufacturing Systems and provides solutions based on Human-Machine Cooperation principles to retain humans in the process control loop with different levels of involvement identified by the levels of automation. The aim of these principles is to propose a human-centered approach to design and evaluate systems, processes, and their interactions with humans. Herein, these principles are detailed and applied to Intelligent Manufacturing Systems using Artificial Self-Organizing systems (ASO) as an example. An assistance system was designed to support cooperation between ASO and human operators. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system and its utility in improving the performance of Human-Machine Systems, as well as its acceptability with regard to human factors. The results presented highlight the advantages of the approach within the context of Industry 4.0.","['Techno-centered design', 'Human-Machine Cooperation', 'Human-centered design', 'Levels of automation', 'Intelligent manufacturing systems', 'Industry 4.0']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2017,Journal,"['Pacaux-Lemoine, Marie-Pierre', 'Trentesaux, Damien', 'Zambrano Rey, Gabriel', 'Millot, Patrick']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2017.05.014
A multi-dimensional cognitive framework for cognitive manufacturing based on OAR model,"With the production system shifting to a multi-variety and small-batch production mode, the production process faces more user requirements, changes, and uncertainties. To solve the above problems, it is necessary to obtain the status and trend changes information and provide information support for the optimization of decision-making and dynamic adjustment of the production system. However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems. In addition, as a formal expression of information processing and knowledge learning process in cognitive informatics, the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model can effectively guide the construction of the production process cognitive mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cognitive framework based on OAR model of the human cognitive world for the dynamic cognitive needs of production system. The framework carries out dynamic cognition from the three dimensions of the manufacturing unit, production situation, and production system, and builds the continuous cognitive abilities from the three dimensions of analysis, decision-making, and learning. By integrating intelligent algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, a computable digital twin model is constructed as a carrier to provide the cognitive enabling technologies and capabilities for the production system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated by the developed computational digital twin platform. The computable digital twin platform provides the production system with important cognitive capabilities such as states perception, trend prediction, optimization decision-making, and knowledge learning, to support the dynamic cognition and optimization decision-making of the production system, and lay a technical foundation for adaptive production and cognitive manufacturing.","['Intelligent manufacturing', 'Cognitive manufacturing', 'Cognitive framework', 'Computable digital twin', 'Multi-dimensional', 'OAR model']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,"['Jiang, Tengyuan', 'Zhou, Jingtao', 'Zhao, Jianhua', 'Wang, Mingwei', 'Zhang, Shusheng']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.09.019
Mechatronic Coupling System for Cooperative Manufacturing with Industrial Robots,"Rising product variants and shortened product life cycles require more flexible and universally utilizable production systems and machines. Consequently, it can be expected that the importance of industrial robots in production will continuously increase, due to their suitability to take over the role of a universal production machine. However, robots are not yet able to fulfill this role. Industrial use of robots has so far been limited mainly to simple transport and handling tasks in the context of human-robot collaboration as well as highly repetitive automated tasks in the context of manufacturing and assembly. For universal use, robots must be capable to perform more demanding tasks in manufacturing with higher requirements on mechanical stiffness and accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a mechatronic system to couple two robots to a parallel kinematic system to temporarily increase the mechanical stiffness. The coupled state of the robots allows load sharing, higher process forces and eventually higher precision. The overall goal is to enable robots to perform more demanding manufacturing tasks and thus to be utilized in a wider range of applications. Design requirements, the development approach and optimization methods of the first coupling module prototype will be presented and discussed. The next development steps, a future demonstration system and possible use cases for the coupling module will be shown in the outlook.","['Robot', 'Cognitive Robotics', 'Robot cooperation']",Procedia CIRP,2023,Journal,"['Mühlbeier, Edgar', 'Bauer, Vincent', 'Schade, Florian', 'Gönnheimer, Philipp', 'Becker, Jürgen', 'Fleischer, Jürgen']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.09.069
A mixed-reality digital set-up to support design for serviceability,"Design for serviceability begins with understanding the customer needs related to availability, reliability, accessibility and visibility, and aims at designing optimized systems where maintenance operations are easy and intuitive in order to reduce the time to repair and service costs. However, service actions are difficult to predict in front of a traditional CAD model. In this context, digital manufacturing tools and virtual simulation technologies can be validly used to create mixed digital environments where service tasks can be simulated in advance to support product design and improve maintenance actions. Furthermore, the use of human monitoring sensors can be used to detect the stressful conditions and to optimize the human tasks. The paper proposes a mixed reality (MR) set-up where operators are digitalized and monitored to analyse both physical and cognitive ergonomics. It is useful to predict design criticalities and improve the global system design. An industrial case study has been developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial to demonstrate how the proposed set-up is used for design for serviceability, on the basis of experimental evidence.","['Design for serviceability', 'Digital Manufacturing (DM)', 'Virtual Simulation', 'Ergonomics', 'Human-Centred Design (HCD)', 'Sustainability']",Procedia Manufacturing,2018,Journal,"['Peruzzini, Margherita', 'Grandi, Fabio', 'Pellicciari, Marcello', 'Campanella, Claudia Elisabetta']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2018.10.089
Cognitive visual anomaly detection with constrained latent representations for industrial inspection robot,"With the fast growth of intelligent manufacturing industry, developing advanced industrial inspection robots is becoming a research and application hotspot in the fields of both computer vision and robotics. This kind of industrial inspection robots is expected to automatically detect anomalous structures (e.g., defects, damages, rejects, etc.) from the images of the manufactured products. Generally, the existing visual anomaly detection (VAD) methods mainly focus on modeling the complex and high-dimensional distribution of normal data, while neglecting the specific visual properties of abnormal data since their frequency of occurrence is much less than that of the normal data. In this paper, inspired by the human cognition on extracting abstractly visual properties and to distinguish the anomaly patterns from the observed data, we propose a novel cognitive VAD method for industrial inspection robot. Specifically, we introduce a constrained latent space to mimic the cognitive ability of humans, where the abstraction learned from the observed normal and anomaly data are represented. We build our method based on a convolutional generative adversarial network and a denoising auto-encoder, where the adversarial learning mechanism is adopted to establish the boundary between the normal and anomaly data. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real-world dataset where the images are captured for the manufactured products. The comprehensive results comparing with several recent VAD methods show that the proposed method is effective to detect the anomaly images of different categories with a high accuracy.","['Visual anomaly detection', 'Industrial inspection robot', 'Latent space representations', 'Cognitive computing']",Applied Soft Computing,2020,Journal,"['Li, Jie', 'Xu, Xing', 'Gao, Lianli', 'Wang, Zheng', 'Shao, Jie']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106539
Human–cobot interaction fluency and cobot operators’ job performance. The mediating role of work engagement: A survey,"Advanced human–robot interaction becomes an essential resource in Industry 4.0. Specifically, the deployment of collaborative robots (cobots) has changed the game in modern smart factories. These robotic agents assist human operators, working with them side-by-side on joint task execution. Because cobots are designed to be more co-workers than tools, fluent interaction between the operators and their robotic counterparts is critical for employees’ task accomplishment and, thus, high performance. The current study investigates the relationships between four perspectives of human–robot interaction fluency (i.e., the human emotions-oriented, the human contribution-oriented, the robot-oriented, and the team-oriented fluency) and operators’ subjective job performance. It also examines the mediating role of work engagement in these relationships. The analysis carried out on 190 male and female cobot operators working on the shop floor showed positive associations between human–robot interaction (HRI) fluency and job performance. The study confirmed the mediating role of work engagement in the relationships of human contribution-oriented fluency and team-oriented fluency with job performance. The obtained results suggest that HRI fluency relates to employee job performance because of the positive affective–cognitive state experienced by the operator when cooperating with a cobot in a coordinated and well-synchronized manner.

On the potential of pupil size as a metric of physical fatigue during a repeated handle push/pull task,"Force output and muscle activity represent the gold standards for measuring physical fatigue. This study explores using ocular metrics for tracking changes in physical fatigue during the completion of a repeated handle push/pull task. Participants completed this task over three trials, and pupil size was recorded by means of a head-mounted eye-tracker. Blink frequency was also measured. Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection.","['Measurement', 'Ocular motor behaviour', 'Repetitive task', 'Force', 'Blink rate', 'Cognitive load', 'Ergonomics', 'Injury', 'Eye-tracking', 'Workers', 'Industry', 'Muscle', 'EMG']",Applied Ergonomics,2023,Journal,"['Biondi, Francesco N.', 'Graf, Frida', 'Cort, Joel']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104025
Assessing needs for cognitive assistance with a cognitive constraints approach,"Smart manufacturing allows for greater job autonomy and distributed decision-making. This job enrichment poses in turn higher demands on the industrial workforce. In this context, cognitive assistance systems are seen as a means to support human information processing and decision-making. However, the understanding of cognitive processes and actual needs is still somewhat vague. What is needed is a deeper understanding of the nature and scope of needs, to properly identify cases for assistance and select and design appropriate tools. Building on the concept of constraints as applied in Cognitive Work Analysis, we elaborate on this perspective by firstly proposing a general model of human cognition centered around the concept of constraints. A series of qualitative interviews with employees in various sectors is then conducted to test the approach. The results demonstrate that a participative method focusing on needs for assistance can yield relevant results. Based upon the experiences from the study, a taxonomy of assistance for cognitive work is finally proposed. This taxonomy can be embedded in facilitated workshops in order to satisfy identified needs.","['Smart Manufacturing', 'Assistance Systems', 'Cognitive Constraints']",Procedia Computer Science,2022,Journal,"['Mühlbradt, Thomas']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.01.212
Innovative robotization of manual manufacturing processes,"Manufacturing industries are continually challenged to adapt to a competitive environment. Consequently, there is an urgency to opt for automation technologies to upgrade their manufacturing facilities and make them more flexible. Especially this relates to automating manual manufacturing processes, which is often challenging to structure to ensure repetitiveness and generalization to other processes within the facility. Consequently, innovating systematic approaches to identify robotization opportunities is an interesting proposition for manufacturing set-ups that would like to integrate collaborative robots on the shop floor and struggle with the decision steps to follow. In this paper, a framework for supporting robotization effort for manufacturing set-ups is proposed. The methodology consisting of five phases, culminating in the identification of robotization opportunities. A case for manual milling manufacturing processes is demonstrated as a ‘proof-of-concept’. The first step of the proposed approach focuses on task decomposition, in which manual manufacturing tasks are characterized. This is followed by task allocation to a robot and human agent based on intrinsic characteristics of the task to capabilities of the agent. Next, alternative layout configurations for candidate cell layouts are generated. In the final step, a candidate layout is selected and modeled in an agent-based simulation platform, considering factors such as realism, interaction safety between the robot and human agent, and interesting manufacturing metrics such as resource utilization and throughput rate. A final configuration is optimized, which visualizes a collaborative robot performs loading and unloading tasks alongside an operator performing highly cognitive tasks. For safety, zoning of the manufacturing cell is visualized, considering a working area separated by a safety fence.","['Robotisation', 'manual manufacturing tasks', 'structured decision making', 'manufacturing cell layout', 'agent-based simulation', 'safety']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Chemweno, Peter', 'Torn, Robbert-Jan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.02.161
Mixed reality-integrated 3D/2D vision mapping for intuitive teleoperation of mobile manipulator,"Depth cues are crucial to increase user perception and spatial awareness of the remote environment when remotely guiding complex robotic systems. A mixed reality (MR) integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping framework for immersive and intuitive telemanipulation of a complex mobile manipulator is presented. The proposed 3D immersive telerobotic schemes provide the users with depth perception through the merging of multiple 3D/2D views of the remote environment via MR subspace. The mobile manipulator platform consists of a 6°-of-freedom (DOF) industrial manipulator, 3D-printed parallel gripper, and mobile base, which can be controlled by non-skilled operators who are physically separated from the robot working space through a velocity-based imitative motion mapping approach. This work evaluates the impact of depth perception and immersion provided by integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes on teleoperation efficiency and user experience in an MR environment. In particular, the MR enhanced systems maintain spatial awareness and perceptual salience of the remote scene in 3D, facilitating intuitive mixed reality human-robot interaction (MR-HRI). This study compared two MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes against a typical 2D Baseline visual display method through pick-and-place, assembly, and dexterous manufacturing tasks. The MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes of teleoperation reduced overall task completion times by 34% and 17%, compared to the MR-2D Baseline, while minimizing training effort and cognitive workload.","['Teleoperation', 'Mixed reality', 'Vision and motion mapping', 'Robotic manipulation']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2022,Journal,"['Su, Yunpeng', 'Chen, Xiaoqi', 'Zhou, Tony', 'Pretty, Christopher', 'Chase, Geoffrey']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102332
An improved physical demand analysis framework based on ergonomic risk assessment tools for the manufacturing industry,"Most of the operational tasks in the manufacturing process entail numerous physical involvements, despite the introduction of automated equipment. Due to this high physical demand in manufacturing, the need for proactive risk assessment to decrease potential injury cannot be ignored. Physical Demand Analysis (PDA) is a widely used tool recommended to all manufactures by the Canadian Workers’ Compensation Board to document the physical, cognitive, and environmental demands of essential tasks. However, limitations exist in utilizing the content generated in current PDA practice to conduct risk identification and risk assessment, and it has limited functionality for providing modified work to proactively mitigate risk. This paper summarizes the input requirements of risk assessment tools and proposes an improved PDA form with an integrated framework to facilitate the comprehensive and intelligent use of PDA. This paper focuses on three aspects of PDA implementation—risk identification, risk evaluation, and risk mitigation—targeting the development of modified work for the manufacturing industry. The framework is implemented in a window and door manufacturing facility, and a case study of a window glazing station is described in this paper in order to assess awkward body postures. Four main ergonomic risk assessments and identifications are recommended.","['Physical demand analysis', 'Ergonomic risk assessment', 'Modified work', ""Workers' compensation board"", 'Manufacturing industry']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2019,Journal,"['Li, Xinming', 'Gül, Mustafa', 'Al-Hussein, Mohamed']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2019.01.004
Methodology to integrate ergonomics information in contextualized digital work instructions,"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), often caused by working in non-ergonomic circumstances, are the most important category of work-related diseases. Different methods exist for examining ergonomics through a variety of postural evaluation techniques (e.g. Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA)), which are mostly performed through manual survey-based observations. Consequently, measuring ergonomics of operators is time-consuming and happens only sporadically, often after problems occur. Furthermore, as an ergonomist must assign a score to the performed activity, the ergonomics evaluation is subjective. These problems can be resolved by continuous and automated ergonomic load monitoring methods that directly provide feedback to operators. In order to monitor the operator without interfering the task at hand, a vision-based ergonomics monitoring system is developed. Here, ergonomic features (e.g. joint angles) are estimated based on multiple video streams, which are used to calculate an objective ergonomic score using a standard ergonomics evaluation technique. Although cognitive operator support systems (i.e. digital work instructions) for manual assembly environments are widely used, they do typically not include ergonomics information. The goal of the methodology presented in this work is to a) formulate or update digital work instructions, b) provide the operator feedback on its ergonomic soundness via work instructions and c) generate ergonomic risk level reports in an automated way based on the outcomes of the vision-based ergonomics evaluator. Making the ergonomic guidelines context-aware ensures that interventions occur at the right time. The methodology is integrated in a framework for context-aware work instructions and is validated via a proof of concept, based on an actual industrial case. Results show that context-awareness enhances user acceptance and ergonomics of the operator.","['Human-centered manufacturing', 'Ergonomics', 'Operator Support Systems', 'Manual Assembly Systems']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Claeys, Arno', 'Hoedt, Steven', 'Domken, Corentin', 'Aghezzaf, El-Houssaine', 'Claeys, Dieter', 'Cottyn, Johannes']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.02.173

One-Fits-All vs. Tailor-Made: User-Centered Workstations for Field Assembly with an Application in Aircraft Parts Manufacturing,"Field assembly of large components for aircraft, ships, trains or big machinery is often done in a rather unstructured environment, with little concern for the individual needs of the involved personnel. Confronted with a shortage of qualified personnel and a generally aging workforce, workstation designers need to put more emphasis on improving ergonomics and allowing for individual adjustments and support for a particular worker. Human factor engineering traditionally uses a “percentile-approach” to work-design, preventing an exact adjustment to the ergonomic needs of particular users. New technological advances provide opportunities for major improvements; novel assistance and information systems allow the accommodation of the needs of an increasingly diverse assembly workforce, while minimizing overall physical and mental stress. Based on a recently developed synopsis of options for individualization of assembly workstations, an example of an application in field assembly is being presented and illustrated by a full-scale demonstrator for the assembly of large scale composite parts for the aerospace industry. The pilot-installation combines a projector-based augmented reality environment for dynamic worker-information with automated operator position tracking and field of vision positioning.

A machine learning approach for improved shop-floor operator support using a two-level collaborative filtering and gamification features,The increasing gap in shopfloor operators’ skillset regarding advanced information and communication technologies along with workforce’s diversity require a cognitive system bridging such technical gaps in order to address evolving production demands and satisfy the human need for self-fulfillment and self-actualization at work. This study discusses on a two-level collaborative filtering approach to improve the distribution of information content provided to an operator for completing a manufacturing activity while considering his or her feedback.

Physiological and perceptual consequences of trust in collaborative robots: An empirical investigation of human and robot factors,"Measuring trust is an important element of effective human-robot collaborations (HRCs). It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.","['Cognitive fatigue', 'ECG', 'Sex', 'Human-robot collaboration', 'Reliability', 'Trust']",Applied Ergonomics,2023,Journal,"['Hopko, Sarah K.', 'Mehta, Ranjana K.', 'Pagilla, Prabhakar R.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103863
A passive robot controller aiding human coaching for kinematic behavior modifications,"Precise programming of robots for industrial tasks is inflexible to variations and time-consuming. Teaching a kinematic behavior by demonstration and encoding it with dynamical systems that are robust with respect to perturbations, is proposed in order to address this issue. Given a kinematic behavior encoded by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), this work proposes a passive control scheme for assisting kinesthetic modifications of the learned behavior in task variations. It employs the utilization of penetrable spherical Virtual Fixtures (VFs) around the DMP’s virtual evolution that follows the teacher’s motion. The controller enables the user to haptically ‘inspect’ the spatial properties of the learned behavior in SE(3) and significantly modify it at any required segment, while facilitating the following of already learned segments. A demonstration within the VFs could signify that the kinematic behavior is taught correctly and could lead to autonomous execution, with the DMP generating the newly learned reference commands. The proposed control scheme is theoretically proved to be passive and experimentally validated with a KUKA LWR4+ robot. Results are compared with the case of using a gravity compensated robot agnostic of the previously learned task. It is shown that the time duration of teaching and the user’s cognitive load are reduced.","['Kinesthetic teaching', 'Virtual fixtures', 'Phri', 'Learning by demonstration']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2020,Journal,"['Papageorgiou, D.', 'Kastritsi, T.', 'Doulgeri, Z.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101824
Complementary learning-team machines to enlighten and exploit human expertise,The benefits of Industry 4.0 are limited by the large computational requirements of ever-larger digital models of complex production systems. A complementary learning paradigm is thus proposed to cultivate knowledge in a team of machines and humans that represents the key to a high-performance manufacturing system. Two types of knowledge are created using light-weighted neural networks and meta-learning: general knowledge of tasks and specific knowledge on collaboration with humans given few interactions.

A neuroergonomics model for evaluating nuclear power plants operators’ performance under heat stress driven by ECG time-frequency spectrums and fNIRS prefrontal cortex network: A CNN-GAT fusion model,"Operators experience complicated physiological and psychological states when exposed to extreme heat stress, which can impair cognitive function and decrease performance significantly, ultimately leading to severe secondary disasters. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a feasible technique to identify their abnormal states to enhance the reliability of human-cybernetics systems. With the advancement of deep learning in physiological modeling, a model for evaluating operators’ performance driven by electrocardiogram (ECG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was proposed, demonstrating high ecological validity. The model fused a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a graph attention network (GAT) backbone to extract discriminative features from ECG time-frequency spectrums and fNIRS prefrontal cortex (PFC) network respectively with deeper neuroscience domain knowledge, and eventually achieved 0.90 AUC. Results supported that handcrafted features extracted by specialized neuroscience methods can alleviate overfitting. Inspired by the small-world nature of the brain network, the fNIRS PFC network was organized as an undirected graph and embedded by GAT. It is proven to perform better in information aggregation and delivery compared to a simple non-linear transformation. The model provides a potential neuroergonomics application to evaluate the human state in vital human-cybernetics systems under industry 5.0 scenarios.","['Graph attention network', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Functional near-infrared spectroscopy', 'Heat stress', 'Neuroergonomics']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2024,Journal,"['Zhang, Yan', 'Jia, Ming', 'Chen, Tao', 'Li, Meng', 'Wang, Jianyu', 'Hu, Xiangmin', 'Xu, Zhihui']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2024.102563
Worker safety in agriculture 4.0: A new approach for mapping operator’s vibration risk through Machine Learning activity recognition,"While being a fundamental driver of competitiveness in agroindustry, technological innovation has also introduced new critical elements related, for example, to the sustainability of the production processes as well as to the safety of workers. In such regard, the advent of the 4th industrial revolution (Agriculture 4.0) based on digitalization, is an unprecedented opportunity of rethinking the role of innovation in a new human-centric perspective. In particular, the establishment of an interconnected work environment and the augmentation of the operator’s physical, sensorial, and cognitive capabilities, are two technologies which can be effectively employed for substantially improving the ergonomics and safety conditions on the workplace. This paper approaches such topic referring to the vibration risk, which is a well-known cause of work-related pathologies, and proposes an original methodology for mapping the risk exposure of the operators to the activities performed. A miniaturized wearable device is employed to collect vibration data, and the signals obtained are segmented in time windows and processed in order to extract the significant features. Finally, a machine learning classifier has been developed to recognize the worker’s activity and to evaluate the related exposure to vibration risks. To validate the methodology proposed, an experimental analysis in real operating conditions has been finally carried out by monitoring the activities performed by a team of workers during harvesting operations. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the methodology proposed.","['Agriculture 4.0', 'Operator safety', 'Muscoskeletal disorders', 'Vibration risk', 'Machine learning', 'Ergonomics']",Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,2022,Journal,"['Aiello, Giuseppe', 'Catania, Pietro', 'Vallone, Mariangela', 'Venticinque, Mario']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.106637
A knowledge graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive manufacturing,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) interconnects a large number of interconnected sensors, actuators, and edge computing devices in the manufacturing systems, where the massive data collected in the manufacturing process has the characteristics of multi-dimensional, heterogeneous, and time series. An effective data representation manner, which can fuse such complex information and enable cognitive manufacturing decision-making from a global perspective, is necessary and challenging. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive manufacturing and applies it in a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) scenario. Based on the digital thread of manufacturing process data, a multi-layer manufacturing knowledge graph is established, including device sensing data, production processing data, and business processing data. With the established knowledge graph, a cognition-driven approach is proposed with a perception-cognition dual system, which achieves perception analysis and cognition decision-making in the resource allocation of the manufacturing process. Finally, responding to the orders of personalized products in a workshop is taken as an illustrative example. The performance of allocating resources of workshop devices under dynamic demand changes shows the advantages of the proposed approach. The proposed manner will lay the foundation for a human-like cognition for processing massive real-time industrial information in CPPS, thus paving a pathway towards the era of cognitive manufacturing.","['Cognitive manufacturing', 'Industrial Internet of Things', 'Knowledge graph', 'Cyber-Physical Production System', 'Data fusion']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2022,Journal,"['Liu, Mingfei', 'Li, Xinyu', 'Li, Jie', 'Liu, Yahui', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Bao, Jinsong']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2021.101515
From Human-Systems Integration to Human-Systems Inclusion for use-centred inclusive manufacturing control systems,"The paper discusses about human-systems inclusion as a new way to take into account human factors on systems engineering. This process applies not only principles from human-supported by automation but also those on automation-supported by human to improve autonomy between humans and machines and autonomy between people. The main concern of human-systems integration is the consideration of a low number of future users in the design process or of the feedback of a majority of users in the evaluation process. Human-system inclusion considers that the system has to take into account and adapt to all users whatever their social, economic, physical or cognitive state, or disability. The concept of “human in the loop” or of “human touch” is usually limited to the definition of the role of humans and machines. It does not consider dynamic variability of users and systems abilities, and anticipate the feasible development of autonomous machines by reducing progressively human engagement in the control and supervisory loop. The paper presents both integration and inclusion concepts for Industry 4.0, and then suggests some challenging perspectives for use-centred inclusive manufacturing control systems in terms of opportunities and threats.","['human-systems integration', 'human-systems inclusion', 'human factors', 'Industry 4.0', 'inclusive design']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2021,Journal,"['Vanderhaegen, F.', 'Nelson, J.', 'Wolff, M.', 'Mollard, R.']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.08.029
Formal model of human erroneous behavior for safety analysis in collaborative robotics,"Recent developments in manufacturing technologies, also known as Industry 4.0, seek to build Smart Factories where supply chains and production lines are equipped with a higher level of automation. However, this significant innovation does not entirely eliminate the need for the presence of human operators; on the contrary, it requires them to collaborate with robots and execute hybrid tasks. Thus, creating safe workspaces for human operators is crucial for the future of factories where humans and robots collaborate closely in common workspaces. The uncertainty of human behavior and, consequently, of the actual execution of workflows, pose significant challenges to the safety of collaborative applications. This paper extends our earlier work, a formal verification methodology to analyze the safety of collaborative robotics applications (Askarpour et al. 2017) [1], with a rich non-deterministic formal model of operator behaviors that captures the hazardous situations resulting from human errors. The model allows safety engineers to refine their designs until all plausible erroneous behaviors are considered and mitigated.

In more detail, pioneer end-effectors and machinery provide the capacity of grasping and handling a variety of products without time-consuming hardware modifications. The backbone of this manipulation scheme is a set of machine learning tools for: a) the planning and synchronization of handling agents, b) identification and localization of workpieces, c) the generation of optimal packaging configurations based on customer orders and identified workpieces, and d) the allocation of the respective handling operations to robots, operators, and machinery.

A Cognitive Digital Twins Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration,"This paper proposes a cognitive digital twin framework for smart manufacturing, and especially for human-robot-collaboration cases.

In the field layer, the physical twin’s data from the physical machine and human operators are transmitted through the edge layer and then to the cloud layer to virtualize the digital twin. The cloud layer generates inference model generation by deep learning training and updates the inference model in the edge layer to make the field’s machine smart. Especially, human operators’ models are built based on the multimodal fusion in the cloud layer for cognitive function. Also, edge-cloud collaborative computing is presented to implement the proposed framework.

Evaluation Framework for Virtual Training within Mixed-Mo del Manual Assembly,"The low volume-high variety strategy of the companies increases the need for well-trained operators. The operators have a much larger cognitive load than before and their expertise must be kept up to date at any time. To solve this problem, efficient training programs must be maintained. A physical replica of the real setting to perform an assembly training is often a too large investment. Therefore, a virtual replica is introduced in many cases. This paper gives an overview of reported experiments on virtual training for manual assembly. All experiments are classified based on some key elements: the evaluation method, the interaction interface and product complexity. An evaluation framework is proposed to compare different virtual training systems.

Towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network: An industrial knowledge graph-based multi-agent reinforcement learning approach,"Empowered by the advanced cognitive computing, industrial Internet-of-Things, and data analytics techniques, today’s smart manufacturing systems are ever-increasingly equipped with cognitive capabilities, towards an emerging Self-X cognitive manufacturing network with higher level of automation. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the readiness of ‘Self-X’ levels (e.g., self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adjust/adaptive/healing) is still in the infant stage. To pave its way, this work stepwise introduces an industrial knowledge graph (IKG)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for achieving the Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. Firstly, an IKG should be formulated based on the extracted empirical knowledge and recognized patterns in the manufacturing process, by exploiting the massive human-generated and machine-sensed multimodal data. Then, a proposed graph neural network-based embedding algorithm can be performed based on a comprehensive understanding of the established IKG, to achieve semantic-based self-configurable solution searching and task decomposition. Moreover, a MARL-enabled decentralized system is presented to self-optimize the manufacturing process, and to further complement the IKG towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. An illustrative example of multi-robot reaching task is conducted lastly to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. As an explorative study, limitations and future perspectives are also highlighted to attract more open discussions and in-depth research for ever smarter manufacturing.","['Industrial knowledge graph', 'Graph embedding', 'Cognitive manufacturing', 'Graph neural network', 'Reinforcement learning']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2021,Journal,"['Zheng, Pai', 'Xia, Liqiao', 'Li, Chengxi', 'Li, Xinyu', 'Liu, Bufan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.08.002
Cognitive engine for augmented human decision-making in manufacturing process control,"A pre-planned production workflow may need to adapt to instantaneous states of resources, materials, and workpieces. This adaptation poses an additional challenge when multiple custom workpieces are enmeshed in complex processes. This paper presents a novel framework, Cognitive Engine Process Controller (CEPC), which realizes a human-centric manufacturing system by augmenting the human in workflow selection and providing the flexibility in using alternative methods in the workflow. The CEPC streamlines overwhelming information for the human to select the next manufacturing steps via dynamic web ontology language (OWL) ontologies, a conflict checker, and a learner.

Guidelines for the integration of cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-centered and collaborative robotics applications,"In the context of Industry 4.0, cognitive ergonomics is crucial for improving the working conditions and the psychosocial well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart machines, as well as for the enhancement of production performances. Nevertheless, this topic is often neglected or ignored when implementing human-robot interaction in industrial settings. Starting from the results obtained from previous studies, this work proposes a structured process to develop and preliminarily validate a set of guidelines to support non-experts in human factors at the early stages of the design of human-centered and collaborative applications. A systematic analysis of the scientific literature has been performed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to identify relevant results on the topic. Successively, the guidelines have been developed starting from such an analysis by considering the target group and the final aim of the work. This phase involved the analysis, classification, summary, and abstraction of relevant statements and results from the selected articles, as well as the update of the previous set of guidelines. The guidelines have been preliminarily validated by an external team of researchers currently doing research in the field. Qualitative feedback on understandability and relevance has been collected to improve the guidelines before further investigations.","['human-robot interaction', 'collaborative robotics', 'cognitive ergonomics', 'Industry 4.0', 'human-centered design']",Procedia CIRP,2023,Journal,"['Gualtieri, Luca', 'Fraboni, Federico', 'Brendel, Hannah', 'Dallasega, Patrick', 'Rauch, Erwin', 'Pietrantoni, Luca']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2023.09.005
Key human factors and their effects on human centered assembly performance,"Today in the increasingly competitive market, consumers prefer to have a great variety of products to choose from; this preference is often coupled with demands for a relatively smaller lot size, shorter lead time, higher quality and lower cost. Consequently, manufacturing companies are being forced to consistently increase flexibility and responsiveness of their production systems in order to accommodate changes of the fluctuating market. Among various forms of production systems, human-centred manufacturing systems can offer such a capability in dealing with product variations and production volumes as human workers can always adapt themselves to perform multiple tasks after a learning process. However, human performance can also be unpredictable and it may alter due to varying psychological and physiological states, which are often overlooked by researchers when designing, implementing or evaluating a manufacturing system. This paper presents a study aiming to address these issues by exploring human factors and their interactions that may affect human performance on human-centred assembly systems. The study was carried out based on a literature review and an industrial survey. Critical system performance indicators, which are affected by human factors, were evaluated and the most significant human factors were identified using the fuzzy extent analysis method. The research findings show that experience is the most significant human factor that affects individual human performance, compared to age and general cognitive abilities in human-centred assembly. By contrast, both human reaction time and job satisfaction have the least effect on human performance. The significance of ageing on human performance was also studied and it was concluded that average assembly time of human workers rises by average 1% per year after the age of 38 years old.","['Manufacturing systems', 'Human factors', 'Assembly', 'Fuzzy extent analysis', 'Ageing']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2019,Journal,"['Abubakar, Maji I.', 'Wang, Qian']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2018.09.009
Exploring the repair process of a 3D printer using augmented reality-based guidance,"In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have transcended their typical rapid prototyping role and become viable methods to directly manufacture end products in a highly versatile manner. Due to its low cost and relative ease of use, fused deposition modeling (FDM) has become the most universally applied AM technology. Nonetheless, skilled operators are often still required to perform maintenance, diagnostic, and repair tasks. Such operators need to be adequately trained. Here, Augmented reality (AR) technology could be used to automate this training and help to promptly provide new operators with the necessary skills to perform specific tasks as required. However, the most effective approach to designing such AR-based assistance systems has not yet been fully explored. Consequently, we address this need by reporting on how to design such guiding systems using well-known design engineering methodologies. We then further assess the applicability of our approach through a user study with domain experts. In addition, we complete our assessment with heuristical verification of system expressiveness to reason about the influence of cognitively important components of the AR interface on the operators.","['Augmented reality, AR', 'AR-guided repair', 'Immersive interface', '3D printing', '3D printer repair', 'Right to repair']",Computers & Graphics,2023,Journal,"['Tadeja, Sławomir K.', 'Solari Bozzi, Luca O.', 'Samson, Kerr D.G.', 'Pattinson, Sebastian W.', 'Bohné, Thomas']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2023.10.017
Combining safety and speed in collaborative assembly systems – An approach to time optimal trajectories for collaborative robots,"Human-robot interaction is a key enabling technology of Industry 4.0 and the prospected pervasiveness of robotics in industrial environments will be not possible without enabling them to safety interact with humans. Such a fact imposes a relevant constraints because the limits imposed by the actual technical deliverables entail strong requirements in the operational velocity of robots when sharing their workspace with humans. In this paper, we address the theoretical limits of velocity under the light of current state-of-the-art trajectory planning and normative requirements. The main goal is to find a methodology to plan safe trajectories without neglecting cognitive ergonomics and production efficiency aspects. We start by considering the set of trajectories which are optimal with respect to a cognitive criteria and give a suitable parametrization to it. Then we are able to formulate the safety requirements in terms of constraints in an optimization problem. Finally, experimental results are provided. This allow the identification of the preferable sets of possible motions which satisfy the operator psychological wellbeing and the assembly process performance by complying the safety requirements in terms of mechanical risk prevention.","['Industry 4.0', 'Collaborative robotics', 'Trajectory planning', 'Assembly', 'Safety', 'Ergonomics']",Procedia CIRP,2021,Journal,"['Rojas, Rafael A.', 'Garcia, Manuel A.

Manufacturing-Uber: Intelligent Operator Assignment in a Connected Factory,"This paper introduces the Manufacturing-Uber concept for dynamic assignment of operators in the Connected Factory. In traditional non-IoT machining environments it is common to assign an operator to a (small) number of machines, clustered in close proximity within a cell. In contrast to “fixed” assignment within a cell, the Manufacturing-Uber approach leverages the connectivity of the IoT environment to allow on-demand “floating” operator assignment across cells. An intelligent assignment engine determines and assigns the operator to achieve best system performance. Results show that Manufacturing-Uber outperforms fixed assignment with respect to reduction in required operators, increased machine up-time and more parts completed.","['Connected Factory', 'Intelligent Manufacturing Systems', 'Cognitive Systems', 'Operator Assignment', 'Industry 4.0']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2019,Journal,"['Greis, Noel P.', 'Nogueira, Monica L.', 'Schmitz, Tony', 'Dillon, Michael']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.621
Interactive Learning of Assembly Processes using Digital Assistance,"Due to an increasing demand for individualized products and the resulting high variability in manufacturing processes, flexibility and cognitive skills of human workers are highly important for manual assembly processes. Nowadays, novice workers are often trained by colleagues or foremen in addition to and alongside their main work. Since time is usually scarce and the procedure can be highly variable, one solution for the companies can be the introduction of digital assistance systems. Hence, the focus of this contribution is the initial learning procedure of the assembly of a new and complex product. Therefore, a user study was conducted in close cooperation with an industrial partner to compare the traditional way of training to the self-paced learning with a digital assistance system. During the execution of the user study, objective data was recorded to allow precise measurements of the individual learning progress. Furthermore, the subjective learning experience was assessed using a customized questionnaire and a standardized task load metric. The evaluation of the study results suggests that learning autonomously with a digital assistance system leads to similar performance curves as learning the process through a personal explanation.","['Digital Assistance System', 'Industrie 4.0', 'Work 4.0', 'User Study', 'Performance Support', 'Five Moments of Need']",Procedia Manufacturing,2019,Journal,"['Oestreich, Hendrik', 'Töniges, Torben', 'Wojtynek, Michael', 'Wrede, Sebastian']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2019.03.003
Introducing Customized ICT for Operators in Manufacturing,Higher complexity and increased global competition emphasises the need of flexibility for organisations in manufacturing. To achieve this puts challenges on todays manufacturing systems and the human operators doing the tasks. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as cognitive automation and to increase information sharing among the operators has been discussed as important tools to meet those challenges. A highly customized mobile application was developed at a large Swedish manufacturing company. This application has been introduced on smartphone devices to the operators in a manufacturing process. This paper presents empirical findings from the first year of this test. The study provides an example where information and communication technology have enabled manufacturing operators to perform new work tasks through increased trust and knowledge.,"['Manufacturing', 'Flexibility', 'ICT', 'Cognitive automation', 'Information sharing']",Procedia CIRP,2016,Journal,"['Åkerman, Magnus', 'Fast-Berglund, Åsa', 'Karlsson, Malin', 'Stahre, Johan']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2015.12.074
A real-time interactive decision-making and control framework for complex cyber-physical-human systems,"Over the past decade, the advancement of digital technology has significantly enhanced operations management in complex cyber-physical systems (CPSs), especially in the production and manufacturing sectors. In such systems, the physical and cyber spaces are generally connected through sensors, networking, and control actions. With the surge in available real-time data, automation and intelligence have become increasingly prevalent. However, full automation and sophisticated intelligence often remain challenging to achieve in real-world CPSs. Currently, many practical tasks in CPSs are best tackled through the integration of human cognitive skills with autonomous systems, highlighting the indispensable role that humans play in these settings. In this study, we present a framework for real-time decision-making and control in complex cyber-physical-human systems. The framework consists of three main modules: intelligent data processing, intelligent decision-making and control, and human-computer interaction. It is designed to provide a practical and implementable framework for supporting real-time decision-making and control in cyber-physical-human system applications. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we build a comprehensive decision support tool to manage several important real-time decision-making and control tasks at a container terminal. The tool is seamlessly integrated into the main operating system of the container terminal and aids decision-makers in making optimal decisions and generating appropriate control actions. The effectiveness of the tool is confirmed by observed improvements in several key operational efficiency indicators at the container terminal.","['Cyber-physical-human systems', 'Human-in-the-loop', 'Decision-making', 'Real-time control', 'Human-computer interaction']",Annual Reviews in Control,2024,Journal,"['Hu, Chen-Lian', 'Wang, Lei', 'Chen, Mei-Ling', 'Pei, Cheng']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2024.100938
Task Analysis and Ergonomic Evaluation in Camshaft Production Operations,"Here we report results of a study conducted at an industrial facility located in the central region of Mexico. It is devoted to the manufacturing of camshafts. We completed an ergonomic assessment on the working circumstances of a production line where workers interact with CNC lathes. Operating this machinery entails the performance of both physical and cognitive effort, circumstances that correspond to a process of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT). The study consisted of a visual inspection of the work areas, video recording both of the site and of the workers in action, analysis of the recordings, and assessment with the REBA method. The tasks performed by the workers consist of a) handling (loading and unloading to/from the lathe) the camshaft components, b) visual inspection and test of compliance to the required parameters, c) adjusting the machinery as required, d) setting the finished pieces in containers. The recorded material allowed identifying 35 separate operations which were then analysed with the REBA Method. The results were as follows: 3 operations classified as a Very High Risk Level, 14 classified as High Risk level, 14 classified as Medium Risk Level and 4 operations classified as Low Risk Level. The body regions most at risk for WRMSD were the trunk, neck, arm and wrist. A series of changes in the workstation layout and in work procedures have been proposed, in order to ameliorate the ergonomic risk found.","['Task analyisis', 'Ergonomic risk evaluation', 'REBA Method', 'AMT']",Procedia Manufacturing,2015,Journal,"['Serratos-Perez, J.

A visual reasoning-based approach for mutual-cognitive human-robot collaboration,"Human-robot collaboration (HRC) allows seamless communication and collaboration between humans and robots to fulfil flexible manufacturing tasks in a shared workspace. Nevertheless, existing HRC systems lack an efficient integration of robotic and human cognitions. Empowered by advanced cognitive computing, this paper proposes a visual reasoning-based approach for mutual-cognitive HRC. Firstly, a domain-specific HRC knowledge graph is established. Next, the holistic manufacturing scene is perceived by visual sensors as a temporal graph. Then, a collaborative mode with similar instructions can be inferred by graph embedding. Lastly, mutual-cognitive decisions are immersed into the Augmented Reality execution loop for intuitive HRC support.","['Human robot collaboration', 'Manufacturing system', 'Visual reasoning']",CIRP Annals,2022,Journal,"['Zheng, Pai', 'Li, Shufei', 'Xia, Liqiao', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Nassehi, Aydin']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cirp.2022.04.016
An ergonomic role allocation framework for dynamic human–robot collaborative tasks,"By incorporating ergonomics principles into the task allocation processes, human–robot collaboration (HRC) frameworks can favour the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). In this context, existing offline methodologies do not account for the variability of human actions and states; therefore, planning and dynamically assigning roles in human–robot teams remains an unaddressed challenge. This study aims to create an ergonomic role allocation framework that optimises the HRC, taking into account task features and human state measurements. The presented framework consists of two main modules: the first provides the HRC task model, exploiting AND/OR Graphs (AOG)s, which we adapted to solve the allocation problem; the second module describes the ergonomic risk assessment during task execution through a risk indicator and updates the AOG-related variables to influence future task allocation. The proposed framework can be combined with any time-varying ergonomic risk indicator that evaluates human cognitive and physical burden. In this work, we tested our framework in an assembly scenario, introducing a risk index named Kinematic Wear. The overall framework has been tested with a multi-subject experiment. The task allocation results and subjective evaluations, measured with questionnaires, show that high-risk actions are correctly recognised and not assigned to humans, reducing fatigue and frustration in collaborative tasks.","['Human–robot teaming', 'Ergonomics', 'Intelligent and flexible manufacturing', 'Human factors and human-in-the-loop']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2023,Journal,"['Merlo, Elena', 'Lamon, Edoardo', 'Fusaro, Fabio', 'Lorenzini, Marta', 'Carfì, Alessandro', 'Mastrogiovanni, Fulvio', 'Ajoudani, Arash']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.12.011
Integrating human cognition in cyber-physical systems: A multidimensional fuzzy pattern model with application to thermal spraying,"The development of next-generation, intelligent manufacturing relies on the realization of human-cyber-physical systems. This key area of transdisciplinary research seeks to interrogate ways of supporting and integrating human cognition and expertise in complex cyber-physical systems, using modelling methods from artificial intelligence. This paper uses the exemplar of wear classification in thermal spraying to outline how relevant cognitive processes can be elicited and combined with technical variables in a singular, efficient and cognitively plausible modelling framework. To this end, eye tracking and high-resolution voltage measurements were performed in a pilot study, and a representative data set was generated for small data problems. Two multidimensional fuzzy pattern classification models were derived. Results show that both human and technical models are significant and complement one another. While the models still require optimizing, they clearly show that the integrative approach is practicable and fruitful. Our findings call for further transdisciplinary research of the development of cognitive assistance as well as predictive maintenance and quality assurance.","['Human-cyber-physical systems', 'Human-machine teaming', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Fuzzy pattern classification', 'Thermal spraying']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2022,Journal,"['Bocklisch, Franziska', 'Paczkowski, Gerd', 'Zimmermann, Stephan', 'Lampke, Thomas']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.03.005
A human-in-the-loop manufacturing control architecture for the next generation of production systems,"In recent years, the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies in the manufacturing landscape promoted the development of smart factories characterised by relevant socio-technical interactions between humans and machines. In this context, understanding and modelling the role of humans turns out to be crucial to develop efficient manufacturing systems of the future. Grounding on previous researches in the field of Human-in-the-Loop and Human Cyber-Physical Systems, the paper aims at contributing to a deep reflection about human-machine interaction in the wider perspective of Social Human-in-the-Loop Cyber-Physical Production Systems, in which more agents collaborate and are socially connected. After presenting an evolution of manufacturing control organisations, an architecture to depict social interactions in smart factories is proposed. The proposed architecture contributes to the representation of different human roles in the smart factory and the exploration of both hierarchical and heterarchical data-driven decision-making processes in manufacturing.","['Industry 4.0', 'Human-in-the-loop', 'Cyber-physical production systems', 'Manufacturing control architecture']",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2020,Journal,"['Cimini, Chiara', 'Pirola, Fabiana', 'Pinto, Roberto', 'Cavalieri, Sergio']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.01.002
Understanding the meaning of human perception and cognitive biases for production planning and control,"The unawareness of production planners about the interaction of key performance indicators (KPIs) in manufacturing systems and misinterpretations of system states often leads to problems when they try to improve them. Exemplary, the lead time syndrome (LTS) represents one of these counterproductive actions. While planners aim to improve due date reliability by planned lead time adjustments, the result is often an aggravation of due date reliability. The underlying reason is that human perception and decision-making process can be biased. Despite its potential to improve the logistic performance, the meaning and the effects of cognitive biases on the decision-making processes in production planning and control were out of scope of recent investigations in the field of production logistics. The aim of this research is to create a starting point to close this research gap by the development of a heuristic framework identifying relevant decision making situations, the potentially active cognitive biases and the potential impact on logistics performance; for this, we combine the research streams of production planning and control (PPC), behavioral supply chain management and psychology.","['production planning', 'control', 'behavioral research', 'cognitive biases', 'human factor', 'decision making']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2019,Journal,"['Bendul, Julia']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.532
System of Robot Learning from Multi-Modal Demonstration and Natural Language Instruction,"Collaborative robots are set to play an important role in the future of the manufacturing industry. They need to be able to work outside of the fencing and perform new tasks to individual customer specifications. The necessity of frequent robot re-programming is a great challenge for small and medium sized companies alike. Learning from demonstration is a promising approach that aims to enable robots to acquire from their end users new task knowledge consisting of a sequence of actions, the associated skills, and the context in which the task is executed. Current systems have limited support for integrating semantics and environmental changes. This paper introduces a system combining several modalities as demonstration interfaces, including natural language instruction, visual observation and hand-guiding, which enables the robot to learn a task comprising a goal concept, a plan and basic actions, with consideration for the current environment state. The task thus learned can then be generalized to similar tasks involving different initial and goal states.","['Human robot collaboration', 'Cognitive robotics', 'Sensor']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Lu, Shuang', 'Berger, Julia', 'Schilp, Johannes']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.084
Empirical Analysis of Software Success Rate Forecasting During Requirement Engineering Processes,"Forecasting on success or failure of software has become an interesting and, in fact, an essential task in the software development industry. In order to explore the latest data on successes and failures, this research focused on certain questions such as is early phase of the software development life cycle better than later phases in predicting software success and avoiding high rework? What human factors contribute to success or failure of a software? What software practices are used by the industry practitioners to achieve high quality of software in their day-to-day work? In order to conduct this empirical analysis a total of 104 practitioners were recruited to determine how human factors, misinterpretation, and miscommunication of requirements and decision-making processes play their roles in software success forecasting. We discussed a potential relationship between forecasting of software success or failure and the development processes. We noticed that experienced participants had more confidence in their practices and responded to the questionnaire in this empirical study, and they were more likely to rate software success forecasting linking to the development processes. Our analysis also shows that cognitive bias is the central human factor that negatively affects forecasting of software success rate. The results of this empirical study also validated that requirements’ misinterpretation and miscommunication were the main causes behind software systems’ failure. It has been seen that reliable, relevant, and trustworthy sources of information help in decision-making to predict software systems’ success in the software industry. This empirical study highlights a need for other software practitioners to avoid such bias while working on software projects. Future investigation can be performed to identify the other human factors that may impact software systems’ success.","['Cognitive bias', 'misinterpretation of requirements', 'miscommunication', 'software success and failure prediction', 'decision making']","Computers, Materials and Continua",2022,Journal,"['Hasnain, Muhammad', 'Ghani, Imran', 'Jeong, Seung Ryul', 'Pasha, Muhammad Fermi', 'Usman, Sardar', 'Abbas, Anjum']",https://doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2023.030162
Ironies of Automation 4.0,"This paper revisits a truly classic publication: Bainbridge’s Ironies of Automation (1983) - but it also aims to make the point that the insights gained many years ago are today becoming more important than ever. As we all know, it is due to technological advances that automation is leading to increasingly complex systems which considerably raises the impact of the potential effects. Bainbridge’s insights originated from manufacturing processes, but they equally apply to process control in general and to vehicle control, e.g., airplanes, road vehicles or trains.

Human reliability study on the door operation from the view of Deep Machine Learning,"Despite the advances made in developing human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, a gap remains between the methods developed by HRA researchers and the ways HRA practitioners actually use. Automated process control and control room operating supervision are important in major process industries. This paper introduces operator’s operational and cognitive errors in the process reliability analysis based on a review of current research on HRA techniques, a procedural framework of qualitative screening phase for the control rooms in the metro industry context, and panel discussions with HRA analysts, systems analysts, and control operators. HRA method Standardized Plant Analysis Risk-HRA (SPARH) based on Machine Learning is utilized to evaluate human error probabilities (HEPs) of action and diagnosis in the Door Operation of Guangzhou Metro Corporation (GMC) Line 1. The results show that improving staff’s experience/training level will greatly enhance operating reliability of door operation. Considering diagnosis complexity and situational awareness, different decision makers have different effects on the operating reliability. We suggest that the quality of ergonomics/Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the availability of existing ergonomics/HMI assessment tools should be evaluated based on industry standards.","['Human reliability analysis (HRA)', 'Qualitative screening', 'Human error probability (HEP)', 'Decision making', 'Machine learning']",Future Generation Computer Systems,2019,Journal,"['Zhan, Yan', 'Tadikamalla, Pandu R.', 'Craft, James A.', 'Lu, Jiansha', 'Yuan, Jijun', 'Pei, Zhi', 'Li, Shiyun']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2018.11.055
"On the Visual Design of ERP Systems The – Role of Information Complexity, Presentation and Human Factors","The investment in Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems is indispensable for manufacturing companies to obtain competitive advantages in the globalized market. However, end-users are confronted with complex interfaces and poor usability of these systems. In the present multi-factorial experiment, we examined the effects of information complexity and presentation as a key aspect of usability with consideration of human factors on decision quality. By using alphanumeric tables of simulated ERP system data to make a decision, users’ decision quality dropped with increasing information complexity and the use of a poor presentation. Furthermore, interactive effects of two different aspects of information complexity (data amount and task complexity) as well as compensatory effects through human factors were revealed. These findings show the importance of empirical user studies in this field and provide several practical implication. Especially, user-centered design processes can substantially contribute to a successful implementation of complex information systems, such as ERP systems.","['Enterprise resource planning system (ERP)', 'Supply chain management', 'Information visualization', 'Information systems', 'Information complexity', 'Human Factors', 'Usability', 'Cognitive abilities', 'User diversity', 'Tables', 'Alphanumeric displays', 'Usability for Industrial Internet']",Procedia Manufacturing,2015,Journal,"['Mittelstädt, Victor', 'Brauner, Philipp', 'Blum, Matthias', 'Ziefle, Martina']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.207
The Comparison Study of Different Operator Support Tools for Assembly Task in the Era of Global Production,"As part of a global production strategy, many manufacturing companies locate their assembly plants in different countries around the world. While outsourcing final assembly closer to key markets has competitive benefits, these companies face new challenges with communication and dissemination of information. Concerning shop-floor operators specifically, these challenges affect the initial training and continuing improvement work instructions in particular. Emerging information and communication technology (ICT) have created new opportunities for supporting operators cognitively. In this paper, an immersive virtual reality (IVR) training environment for LEGO gearbox assembly was developed and tested. IVR technologies offer new opportunities where operators can access training and work instructions in an immersive environment, which could potentially improve and influence the operator performance and emotion. Both objective performance and subjective emotion were measured and the impacts were analyzed. The results were compared with four different operator support approaches and it was seen that IVR technology has the potential of improving operator and that further studies on integration, information, communication design and development of measurement methods are needed before the industry can benefit from the full potential of IVR technology.","['Virtual reality', 'operator support', 'assembly', 'global production']",Procedia Manufacturing,2017,Journal,"['Gong, Liang', 'Li, Dan', 'Mattsson, Sandra', 'Åkerman, Magnus', 'Berglund, Åsa Fasth']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.254
Application of robotics in offshore oil and gas industry— A review Part II,"Demands for oil and gas are increasing with urbanization and industrialization of the world’s increasing population. Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution.

Industry 4.0 and corporate sustainability: An exploratory analysis of possible impacts in the Brazilian context,"This paper aims to analyse the impacts of Industry 4.0 on corporate sustainability, considering the Brazilian context. From a literature review, 12 impacts were identified and used to structure a questionnaire. This questionnaire was applied in a survey with experienced Brazilian researchers. The data was analysed using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, Descriptive Statistics and TOPSIS, which allowed for impact ordering. It was evidenced that all the presented impacts will be evident in the Brazilian context in a ten-year horizon. Of these impacts, six stand out: 1) the reduction of job offers for manual and repetitive activities and the emergence of new, high value-added professions; 2) the emergence of innovative business; 3) the reduction of work accidents due to the expanded use of robots in dangerous tasks for humans; 4) problems with the employees’ qualification pace in the required modernisation changes; 5) the integration of all value chain activities, allowing for a better analysis of environmental, social and economic impacts; and 6) improvements in physical and cognitive ergonomics due to the use of sensors. These findings can contribute to the expansion of the debates related to the theme and can be used as a base for defining future industrial policies in Brazil.","['Sustainability', 'Industry 4.0', 'Impacts', 'Exploratory study']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2021,Journal,"['Siltori, Patricia F.S.', 'Anholon, Rosley', 'Rampasso, Izabela Simon', 'Quelhas, Osvaldo L.G.', 'Santa-Eulalia, Luis A.', 'Leal Filho, Walter']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120741
The beginnings of tool innovation in human ontogeny: How three- to five-year-olds solve the vertical and horizontal tube task,"This study focuses on tool innovation in preschoolers. It extends previous work by investigating task- and age-related changes in success rates, latency to success, and solution strategies. Three- to five-year-olds had 10 min to retrieve a toy from either a horizontal or a vertical tube by manufacturing a tool from multiple materials. In the Horizontal Tube Task, success rates were high irrespective of age. Solution strategies revealed mainly second-order innovation (i.e., manipulating materials while retrieving the toy). In the Vertical Tube Task, success rates increased with age and solution strategies reflected mainly first-order innovation (i.e., manufacturing the tool before trying to retrieve the toy).

A learning system for adjustment processes based on human sensory perceptions,"Creating, designing and adjusting products are essential decision processes underlying creative industries, such as painting, perfume, food and beverage industries. These processes require the participation and continuous supervision of professionals with highly-developed expert sensory abilities. Training of these experts is very complex due to the difficulty of transmitting intuitive knowledge obtained from perception. A new methodology for capturing this sensory expert knowledge that relies on a machine learning tool, previously trained with ‘state-action’ type patterns, jointly with an actions generator module, is proposed in this work. The method is based on a closed loop architecture together with the decomposition of complex sensory knowledge into basic elements capable of being handled by standard machine learning systems. A real case application to color-adjustment in the automotive paint manufacturing industry is presented showing the potential benefits of the method.","['Artificial cognitive systems', 'Expert knowledge management', 'Color adjustment', 'Color formulation']",Cognitive Systems Research,2018,Journal,"['Ruiz, Francisco Javier', 'Agell, Núria', 'Angulo, Cecilio', 'Sánchez, Mónica']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.06.011
Application of robotics in onshore oil and gas industry—A review Part I,"With ever increasing global demand and depleting resources for fossil fuels, oil and gas industry is now positively looking for advanced robotic solutions to increase their productivity and safety. With time easy resources of the fossil fuels are shrinking and newly searched reservoirs, to feed supply demands of global consumption, are mostly located in extreme environmental conditions such as hot deserts, deep water and arctic zone etc. Production of the fossil fuels, in such inhospitable environmental conditions, poses difficult challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE). Tragic incidents like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills are examples of such challenges. Therefore, oil and gas industry has lot to learn from successful implementation of robotics and automation for dull, dirty and dangerous (3D) tasks of manufacturing industry. Most of the robotics technologies, currently used in the oil and gas industry, are mainly focused on inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) of plant facilities with higher frequency and accuracy. Fundamental idea, involved in the automatization of these processes, is based on the principle of teleoperation with skilled operator. Automation of 3D tasks not only improves HSE standards but also lead to much needed economic efficiency by reducing production cycle, floor space and number of staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the risks involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots, first without achieving very high reliability, is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots, where actions are performed by robots but cognitive decisions are still taken by skilled operator, is an excellent choice for this industry as a near future solution. In the onshore oil and gas industry robotic solutions are used both in upstream and downstream processes, such as site survey, drilling, production and transportation, mainly focused in the form of in-pipe inspection robots (IPIRs), tank inspection robots (TIRs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) etc. This paper presents the state of art robotic solutions currently used in onshore oil and gas facilities.","['Robotics', 'Automation', 'In-pipe inspection robots', 'Tank inspection robots', 'NDT', 'UAV', 'Wireless sensor networks (WSN)', 'Oil and gas exploration']",Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2016,Journal,"['Shukla, Amit', 'Karki, Hamad']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2015.09.012
Facilitation or hindrance: The contingent effect of organizational artificial intelligence adoption on proactive career behavior,"The advent of Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is catalyzing significant transformations in human work dynamics. Nonetheless, there exists no unanimous consensus among researchers regarding whether organizational AI adoption has a favorable or unfavorable impact on employees' career development. Building upon social cognitive theory, we explores the underlying mechanism through which organizational AI adoption influences employees' proactive career behavior. A three-wave time-lagged survey involving 348 employees from three hotels and five advanced manufacturing enterprises in Chengdu, China, was conducted. The findings revealed that organizational AI adoption led to a reduction in employees' self-perceived employability. The prominence of an employee's future work self-salience was found to be a determining factor in how their self-perceived employability influenced proactive career behaviors. Specifically, this impact manifested negative for employees exhibiting high levels of future work self-salience, while it appears positive for those with low levels. Finally, this study confirmed the moderating role of future work self-salience in the indirect impact of organizational AI adoption on proactive career behavior through self-perceived employability. Our study underscores the significance of considering individual characteristics, such as future work self-salience, in analyzing how organizational AI adoption affects employees' career-related behaviors.","['Organizational AI adoption', 'Proactive career behavior', 'Self-perceived employability', 'Future work self-salience']",Computers in Human Behavior,2024,Journal,"['Lin, Hongxia', 'Tian, Jian', 'Cheng, Bao']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2023.108092
Coordinating the interruption of assembly workers in manufacturing,"This paper examines how interruptions from information and communications technology systems affect errors and the time to complete tasks for assembly workers. Interruptions have previously been examined in laboratory experiments and office environments, but not much work has been performed in other authentic environments. This paper contains the results of an experiment that was performed in a simulated manufacturing assembly environment, which tested the effects of interruptions on a manual assembly task. The experiment used existing interruption coordination methods as a basis, and the results showed a difference in the effect of interruptions and interruption coordination between cognitively complex laboratory tasks and manual assembly tasks in an authentic environment. Most notably, the negative effects of interruptions delivered without consideration were smaller in this experiment. Based on these findings, recommendations were developed for designing interruption systems for minimizing the costs (errors and time) imposed by interruptions during assembly tasks in manufacturing.","['Interruptions', 'Manual assembly', 'Manufacturing']",Applied Ergonomics,2017,Journal,"['Kolbeinsson, Ari', 'Thorvald, Peter', 'Lindblom, Jessica']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2016.07.015
Automated machines and the labor wage gap,"This paper analyzes how the increase in the proportion of automated machines to general capital inputs affects the wage gap of the labor force complementary to the two types of capital, the general equilibrium model and constant elasticity of substitution production function are introduced and the impact mechanism is explored using a task-based model. Data for listed Chinese manufacturing companies from 2012 to 2020 is used and a double fixed effects model is invoked for empirical testing. The findings show that (1) a rise in the proportion of automated machines to general capital inputs increases the wage gap of labor complementary to automated machine capital and general capital, and a rise in the proportion of demand for both types of labor complementary to automated machines and general capital is an influential mechanism; (2) the productivity-enhancing effect suppresses the widening of the wage gap between the two types of labor; and (3) the results of heterogeneity analysis show that an increase in automated machine inputs among non-state-owned manufacturing firms and technology-intensive firms widens the labor wage gap. This paper makes a contribution to both theoretical and empirical analysis and provides references for the alleviation of the labor wage gap.","['Automated machines', 'General capital', 'Wage gap']",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2024,Journal,"['Jiang, Hong', 'Wang, Xue', 'Liu, Chongguang']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123505
Enabling the human in the loop: Linked data and knowledge in industrial cyber-physical systems,"Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems have benefitted substantially from the introduction of a range of technology enablers. These include web-based and semantic computing, ubiquitous sensing, internet of things (IoT) with multi-connectivity, advanced computing architectures and digital platforms, coupled with edge or cloud side data management and analytics, and have contributed to shaping up enhanced or new data value chains in manufacturing. While parts of such data flows are increasingly automated, there is now a greater demand for more effectively integrating, rather than eliminating, human cognitive capabilities in the loop of production related processes. Human integration in Cyber-Physical environments can already be digitally supported in various ways. However, incorporating human skills and tangible knowledge requires approaches and technological solutions that facilitate the engagement of personnel within technical systems in ways that take advantage or amplify their cognitive capabilities to achieve more effective sociotechnical systems. After analysing related research, this paper introduces a novel viewpoint for enabling human in the loop engagement linked to cognitive capabilities and highlighting the role of context information management in industrial systems. Furthermore, it presents examples of technology enablers for placing the human in the loop at selected application cases relevant to production environments. Such placement benefits from the joint management of linked maintenance data and knowledge, expands the power of machine learning for asset awareness with embedded event detection, and facilitates IoT-driven analytics for product lifecycle management.","['Cyber-physical systems', 'Internet of things', 'Context information management', 'Product lifecycle management', 'Asset lifecycle management', 'Maintenance', 'Human in the loop']",Annual Reviews in Control,2019,Journal,"['Emmanouilidis, Christos', 'Pistofidis, Petros', 'Bertoncelj, Luka', 'Katsouros, Vassilis', 'Fournaris, Apostolos', 'Koulamas, Christos', 'Ruiz-Carcel, Cristobal']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2019.03.004
Testing the vertical and cyber-physical integration of cognitive robots in manufacturing,"In recent years, cognitive robots have started to find their way into manufacturing halls. However, the full potential of these robots can only be exploited through (a) an integration of the robots with the Manufacturing Execution System (MES), (b) a new and simpler way of programming based on robot skills, automated task planning, and knowledge modeling, and (c) enabling the robots to function in a shared human/robot workspace with the ability to handle unexpected situations. The STAMINA project has built a robotic system that meets these objectives for an automotive kitting application, which has also been tested, validated, and demonstrated in a relevant environment (TRL6). This paper describes the STAMINA robot system and the evaluation of this system on a series of realistic kitting tasks.

Influence of work design elements on work performance and work perception – an experimental investigation,"Future work systems will be highly computerized and cognitively challenging. In order to design these systems being both productive and human-oriented, further work design research in the specific area of cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) is needed. Thus, we conducted an experimental investigation on three work design elements in CPPS. Within the experiment, the participants were asked to solve model manufacturing scheduling tasks which go along with a questionnaire.

The Knowledge-based tools for the steel industry,"During last years, the evolution of process supervision shifted from a rule-base-oriented to a knowledge-base-oriented approach, where the automation systems relieve the human operator from most tedious and repetitive low-level information manipulation tasks; knowledge is considered more important than man by the introduction of applications for strict process control and tools for decision. In this context, Danieli Automation set itself a goal to design a new generation of supervision and control systems, which could provide added value to the operation of plant areas, taking advantage of recent advancements in user interface and information technology. These goals were met by creating new applications in which the know-how is transferred from operators to automation systems and the humanmachine interfaces are optimized in order to improve the quality of the operator work, making decisions faster and more accurate. The result is an innovative man-machine interface, called OPERATOR ASSISTANT. This paper aims to explain all the studies that have been done to develop this new tool, from ergonomics to the choice of the development platform, passing through the decision for the multitouch technology, the minimization of complexity, the consideration of cultural factors and the restraint of the emotional stress for the user.

Inclusive manufacturing through the application of lean tools to sustainability issues,"Lean Thinking is a management philosophy that focuses on reducing waste and enhancing customer value. This study applies the concept of Lean Thinking to confront sustainability challenges in manufacturing companies, particularly with regards to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the Agenda 2030 that aim to integrate people with disabilities. Some commonly used and less frequently used tools, including the Ishikawa Diagram, Value Stream Mapping, and Cognitive Maps, were revised to mitigate the risks posed to the inclusion, full utilization, and well-being of workers. The findings indicate that adopting a lean thinking approach can facilitate the inclusive design of new production processes and enhance the efficiency of current operations, promoting social sustainability. The study identified certain challenges and drawbacks associated with applying Lean Thinking to sustainability concerns, including the necessity for stakeholder involvement, organizational cultural transformations, and steadfast devotion. Additionally, the study contributes to the extensive literature on lean and sustainability by offering practical use cases and informative perspectives on utilizing lean thinking as a means of promoting sustainable process enhancement and development.","['lean thinking', 'lean tools', 'sustainable development', 'disability', 'inclusion']",Procedia CIRP,2024,Journal,"['Antonelli, Dario', 'Stadnicka, Dorota', 'Litwin, Paweł']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2024.01.085
Prototyping proactive and adaptive techniques for human-robot collaboration in manufacturing using virtual reality,"Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has emerged in recent years as a need for common collaborative execution of manufacturing tasks. This work examines two types of techniques of safe collaboration that do not interrupt the flow of collaboration as far as possible, namely proactive and adaptive. The former are materialised using audio and visual cognitive aids, which the user receives as dynamic stimuli in real time during collaboration, and are aimed at information enrichment of the latter. Adaptive techniques investigated refer to the robot; according to the first one of them the robot decelerates when a forthcoming contact with the user is traced, whilst according to the second one the robot retracts and moves to the final destination via a modified, safe trajectory, so as to avoid the human. The effectiveness as well as the activation criteria of the above techniques are investigated in order to avoid possible pointless or premature activation. Such investigation was implemented in a prototype highly interactive and immersive Virtual Environment (VE), in the framework of H-R collaborative hand lay-up process of carbon fabric in an industrial workcell. User tests were conducted, in which both subjective metrics of user satisfaction and performance metrics of the collaboration (task completion duration, robot mean velocity, number of detected human-robot collisions etc.) After statistical processing, results do verify the effectiveness of safe collaboration techniques as well as their acceptability by the user, showing that collaboration performance is affected to a different extent.","['Human-robot collaboration', 'Virtual environments', 'Human-robot interaction', 'Safety', 'Proactive techniques', 'Adaptive trajectory', 'Collision Avoidance']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2018,Journal,"['Matsas, Elias', 'Vosniakos, George-Christopher', 'Batras, Dimitris']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2017.09.005
"Human-centred work design in times of digital change – work conditions, level of digitization and recent trends for object-related tasks","New technologies are influencing today’s work and change social attitudes towards the organization and design of work. Against this background, the question arises as to how human-centred work design has to be in the digital age. In order to derive indications for work design, first it is necessary to find out which work conditions actually are present for different tasks and what their level of digitization is. This article focuses on the working conditions and the level of digitization of object-related tasks. These tasks are characterized by the fact that objects are processed or handled. In particular, it includes the task groups manufacturing, transporting and cleaning. For these three groups, current working conditions of N = 6.435 employees with object-related tasks were analyzed based on the BIBB/BAuA Employment Survey. Furthermore, the current state of digitization of N = 411 employees with object-related tasks was analyzed based on the survey Digitization and Change in Employment (DiWaBe). The results show, that a high proportion of physical work requirements and physical-chemical environmental conditions have an impact on object-related tasks. Furthermore, the results indicate tendencies towards monotonous work processes. Object-related tasks show a rather low degree of digitization. However, especially in manufacturing and transport, detailed instructions are often given by means of various technologies. Based on the data analysis, a structured literature analysis was conducted about the current state of research on new technologies in object-related tasks. It was found, that research and practice is concerned with technologies that meet the high physical demands of object-related tasks in particular (e.g. HRC, exoskeletons). In addition, there are many approaches to support employees cognitively with digital assistance systems. This article present the results of the data and literature analysis.","['OSH', 'new technologies', 'work conditions']",Procedia CIRP,2022,Journal,"['Terhoeven, Jan', 'Tegtmeier, Patricia', 'Wischniewski, Sascha']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.04.049
Deep learning-based smart task assistance in wearable augmented reality,"Wearable augmented reality (AR) smart glasses have been utilized in various applications such as training, maintenance, and collaboration. However, most previous research on wearable AR technology did not effectively supported situation-aware task assistance because of AR marker-based static visualization and registration. In this study, a smart and user-centric task assistance method is proposed, which combines deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to provide more effective visual guidance with less cognitive load. In particular, instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN and markerless AR are combined to overlay the 3D spatial mapping of an actual object onto its surrounding real environment. In addition, 3D spatial information with instance segmentation is used to provide 3D task guidance and navigation, which helps the user to more easily identify and understand physical objects while moving around in the physical environment. Furthermore, 2.5D or 3D replicas support the 3D annotation and collaboration between different workers without predefined 3D models. Therefore, the user can perform more realistic manufacturing tasks in dynamic environments. To verify the usability and usefulness of the proposed method, we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses by conducting two user studies: 1) matching a virtual object to a real object in a real environment, and 2) performing a realistic task, that is, the maintenance and inspection of a 3D printer. We also implemented several viable applications supporting task assistance using the proposed deep learning-based task assistance in wearable AR.","['Smart task assistance', 'Wearable augmented reality', 'Deep learning-based task assistance', 'AR smart glasses']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2020,Journal,"['Park, Kyeong-Beom', 'Kim, Minseok', 'Choi, Sung Ho', 'Lee, Jae Yeol']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101887
"Human-Centred Dissemination of Data, Information and Knowledge in Industry 4.0","The manufacturing industry faces immense challenges for maintaining and increasing their productivity and flexibility. In this context, it is important for companies to ensure that their employees have the relevant data, information and knowledge necessary to make well-informed decisions. Due to recent development with Industry 4.0 enabling technologies that create new possibilities, the amount of available data, information and knowledge increase rapidly, but the insights into how to utilize it to its full potential are still lacking. In this paper, a human-centred perspective has been applied, aiming at improving how to cognitively support humans at work with new Industry 4.0 enabling technologies. Heavy emphasis is placed on people’s requirements and preferences of data, information and knowledge for enhancing their performance and satisfaction at work. This paper examines the relationship between existing literature on dissemination of data, information and knowledge within the manufacturing industry with state-of-the-art research on Industry 4.0. The outcome of the research recognizes the increased importance of utilizing data, information and knowledge for people at work, facilitated by exploiting the new possibilities from Industry 4.0. To accomplish this, it is concluded that there exists an urgency to design: both a holistic framework for identifying and accommodating individuals’ needs and expectations of relevant data, information and knowledge; and demonstrators and concepts to simplify the implementation of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies that support the aforementioned dissemination of data, information and knowledge.","['data', 'information', 'knowledge', 'Industry 4.0']",Procedia CIRP,2019,Journal,"['Li, Dan', 'Landström, Anna', 'Fast-Berglund, Åsa', 'Almström, Peter']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2019.04.261
Addressing the Issues and Developments Correlated with Envisaged 5G Mobile Technologies: Comprehensive Solutions,"Fifth Generation (5G) communications are regarded as the cornerstone to household consumer experience improvements and smart manufacturing revolution from the standpoint of industries' objectives. It is anticipated that Envisaged 5G (E5G) mobile technology would be operational in certain developed countries by 2023. The Internet of Things (IoTs) will transform how humans live when combined with smart and integrated sensing devices, such as in-home sensing devices.

A fatigue-conscious dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem by enhanced NSGA-II: An application from casting workshop,"Dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem (DRCFJSP) becomes a hot research topic in recent years. However, worker fatigue is barely considered in DRCFJSP, which will result in unsuitable task assignments for workers and bring about negative effects such as muscle fatigue and cognitive confusion. To this end, a fatigue-conscious DRCFJSP is proposed in this paper, aiming at simultaneously relieving fatigue and promoting productivity by joint scheduling of machines and workers. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to minimize the maximum worker fatigue and makespan. Furthermore, an enhanced NSGA-II (ENSGA) is developed in this paper to cope with the proposed problem. In the ENSGA, four dispatch rules are designed to generate high-quality solutions at the initialization stage. Two neighborhood structures based on a novel method of defining the critical path are designed to strengthen the ability of local search. Finally, with the comprehensive experiments on extensive test instances and a case study from real-world casting workshop, the effectiveness of proposed ENSGA for solving the fatigue-conscious DRCFJSP is verified, and the significance of the proposed joint scheduling approach is elucidated. This work renders the decision-maker practical and effective scheduling with fatigue-conscious for the machine and worker constrained flexible manufacturing system.","['Dual resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Worker fatigue', 'Initialization method', 'Neighborhood structure', 'Casting workshop']",Computers & Industrial Engineering,2021,Journal,"['Tan, Weihua', 'Yuan, Xiaofang', 'Wang, Jinlei', 'Zhang, Xizheng']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2021.107557

Learning Environment to Take Operational Decision in Emergency Situation,"In psychological and human factors engineering sciences have been strengthened research on the way in which social and demographic variables influence the cognitive functioning of the employee at the time of decision. It is understood that performing tasks at work seeks continuous satisfaction of demands for physical and material security, social and emotional comfort as well as economic and productive stability. Due to the complexity of living systems in the global community, involving increasing environmental changes and limit natural resources, intolerance and social violence, political and economic crises, the demand is presented by investigations of such dimensions on decision making, between designated professional to decide in emergency situations. In the high-risk process industry can happen emergency situations where the lives of many people depend on the decision of a few actors.

Effect of cognitive automation in a material handling system on manufacturing flexibility,"Manufacturing flexibility has become a competitive strategy to deal with market uncertainty. The application of advanced automation technology in manufacturing systems has tremendously increased manufacturing flexibility; however, this creates significant mental pressure for operators who must deal with a series of decisions, and this decreases their job satisfaction. In this study, we primarily investigated how cognitive automation and mechanical automaton in the material handling system affect manufacturing flexibility. Cognitive automation is defined as a computerized system that provides relevant information to operators, thereby reducing the cognitive workload; mechanical automation refers to an automated system to reduce the physical workload. The case of a truck-body production line of a truck company was investigated by applying modified DYNAMO++ for the material handling system. Then, a simulation program, AnyLogic 6.9.0 was used to investigate the effect of the cognitive and mechanical automation in the material handling system on manufacturing flexibility. The research results showed that the levels of cognitive and mechanical automation of the material handling system were increased by 52.4% and 48.0%, respectively, which resulted in improving manufacturing flexibility by 14.2% in cycle time, 53.3% in downtime, and 26.3% in the number of tasks.

This combination was proposed from the perceived need to structure one of the stages of the application of the CAST technique where unsafe control actions, or human errors, that occurred in the course of accidental events are analyzed, for which the application of the TRACEr technique proved extremely useful. From the application of the proposed combination to an accident that occurred in an oil production unit in operation on the coast of southeastern Brazil, it was possible to obtain a deeper understanding of the psychological phenomena that preceded one of the unsafe control actions, as well as the identification of performance shaping factors that contributed to its occurrence. These results demonstrated the conceptual cohesion and mutual complementarity of the associated techniques, which allowed a comprehensive understanding of the accidental event and, consequently, the elaboration of safety recommendations more appropriate to the findings of the analysis, better specified to the aspects of human factors involved.","['Accident analysis', 'Human error', 'System theoretic accident model and process', 'Technique for the retrospective and predictive analysis of cognitive errors', 'Oil and gas industry']",Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries,2022,Journal,"['Fagundes, José Moisés', 'Gaya de Figueiredo, Marco Antonio', 'Alberton, André Luis', 'Antonio Luquetti dos Santos, Isaac José']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlp.2021.104639
Micro- and macroergonomic changes in mental workload and medication safety following the implementation of new health IT,"Health information technology (IT) is a promising way to achieve safer medication management in the delivery of healthcare. However, human factors/ergonomics dictates that in order to make the complex, cognitive work of healthcare delivery safer, health IT must properly support human cognition. This means, for example, that new health IT must reduce, not increase, workload during safety-critical tasks. The present study was the first to quantitatively assess the short- and long-term impact of bar coded medication administration (BCMA) IT on nurses' mental workload as well as on perceived medication safety. One-hundred seventy registered nurses across 3 dissimilar clinical units at an academic, freestanding pediatric hospital in the Midwest US participated in surveys administered before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the hospital implemented BCMA. Nurses rated their external mental workload (interruptions, divided attention, being rushed) and internal mental workload (concentration, mental effort) during medication administration tasks as well as the likelihood of each of three medication safety events: medication administration errors, medication errors on the clinical unit, and clinical unit-level adverse drug events. Clinical unit differences were assessed. Findings generally confirmed the hypothesis that external but not internal mental workload was associated with the perceived likelihood of a medication safety event. Comparisons of mental workload from pre- to post-BCMA revealed statistically significant changes in the critical care unit only. Medication safety appeared to improve over the long term in the hematology/oncology unit only. In the critical care and medical/surgical units, medication safety exhibited short-term improvements that were eliminated over time. Changes in mental workload and medication safety, two classically microergonomic constructs, were deeply embedded in macroergonomic phenomena. These included the fit between the BCMA system and the nature of nursing work, the process of BCMA implementation, and BCMA interactions with concurrent changes occurring in the hospital. Findings raise questions about achieving sustainable performance improvement with health IT as well as the balance between micro- and macroergonomic approaches to studying technology change. Relevance to industry Designers must consider how technology changes cognitive work, including mental workload. Hospitals and other implementers of technology must ensure that new technology fits its users, their tasks, and the context of use, which may entail tailoring implementation, for example, to specific clinical units. Evaluators must look over time to assess both changes in cognitive work and implementation issues. Healthcare practitioners must also recognize that new technology means a complex transformation to an already complex sociotechnical system, which calls for a macroergonomic approach to design and analysis.","['Health information technology', 'Bar coded medication administration', 'Macroergonomics', 'Mental workload', 'Medication safety', 'Nursing']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2015,Journal,"['Holden, Richard J.', 'Brown, Roger L.', 'Scanlon, Matthew C.', 'Rivera, A.

Physical Activity as a Strategy for Prevention and Health Promotion in the Occupational Context: An Example of Corporate Engagement,"Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM) is a public utility company that provides electricity, natural gas, water supply, basic sanitation, waste management, information technology and communication services that meet the very highest international standards of quality. The company serves some 3.6 million residents in Medellín and the Valle de Aburrá Metropolitan Area, with its coverage extending to 125 municipalities in the region. Organized as a “state-owned, industrial and commercial enterprise”, EPM has established itself at the forefront of the sector.

Two-sided matching model for complex product manufacturing tasks based on dual hesitant fuzzy preference information,"Due to the increasing complexity in socioeconomic environments and the fuzziness in human cognition, the cognitive information over alternatives provided by a decision organization consisting of several experts is usually uncertain and hesitant. Consequently, in order to solve the fuzziness and uncertainty of preference information in the matching process of complex product manufacturing tasks on the cloud manufacturing platform, a novel two-sided matching model based on dual hesitant fuzzy preference information is proposed. Firstly, the two-sided matching problem and the dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) are described. Then, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is constructed and normalized according to the preference information provided by agents on both sides. Sequentially, the dual hesitant fuzzy preference information evaluation matrix is transformed into the satisfaction degree matrix by the projection technology. Simultaneously, considering the stable matching constraint, a multi-objective two-sided matching optimization model which maximizes the satisfaction degree and minimizes the difference degree of two-sided agents is established. Further, the matching relative competition degree is used to convert the multi-objective optimization model into a single-objective optimization model, and the matching algorithm is designed for solving the model. Moreover, an illustrative example is employed to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the developed model. Subsequently, the sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the stability of the proposed matching results, and the comparative analysis is carried out to illustrate the reliability of the proposed matching algorithm and the merits of the developed model. It reveals that the proposed model can not only obtain stable matching results but also give more choices in matching methods.","['Complex products', 'Two-sided matching', 'Dual hesitant fuzzy preference', 'Satisfaction degree', 'Matching optimization model']",Knowledge-Based Systems,2019,Journal,"['Li, Baodong', 'Yang, Yu', 'Su, Jiafu', 'Zhang, Na', 'Wang, Sheng']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2019.104989
Cognitive work analysis: An influential legacy extending beyond human factors and engineering,"Jens Rasmussen’s multifaceted legacy includes cognitive work analysis (CWA), a framework for the analysis, design, and evaluation of complex sociotechnical systems. After considering the framework’s origins, this paper reviews its progress, predictably covering experimental research on ecological interface design, case studies of the application of CWA to human factors and engineering problems in industry, and methods and modelling tools for CWA. Emphasis is placed, however, on studying the nexus between some of the recent results obtained with CWA and the original field studies of human problem-solving that motivated the framework’s development. Of particular interest is a case study of the use of CWA for military doctrine development, a problem commonly regarded as lying outside the fields of human factors and engineering. It is concluded that the value of CWA, even for such diverse problems, is likely to result from its conceptual grounding in empirical observations of patterns of human reasoning in complex systems.","['Cognitive work analysis', 'Problem-solving', 'Reasoning', 'Sociotechnical systems', 'Jens Rasmussen']",Applied Ergonomics,2017,Journal,"['Naikar, Neelam']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2016.06.001
Selecting Video Analytics using Cognitive Ergonomics: A Case Study for Operational Experimentation,"The objective of this research is to achieve innovation with a disruptive edge in a human-driven operational environment where layering key information is critical to the customer's current story-boarding solution space. However, new online video data sources present an increasing complexity, with visual cues trapped in hours of video data with no automated means to easily locate and extract key data nuggets. The solution is the introduction of disruptive concepts with an ‘operational experimentation’ focus to mimic the customer's approach. This new method will embrace the larger ‘tell me a story’ perceptive approach to automate the process of building a user defined text story representation based on the accurate discovery / identification of relevant content in the online videos. This paper will cover overall components of the operational experimentation methodology which is part of a long-term (12-24 month) software research and development (R&D) prototyping strategy to operationalize software through a customer driven partnership. This methodology borrows ideas from multiple disciplines including cognitive ergonomics, computer science and industrial engineering. This case study emphasizes the importance of incorporating how humans cognitively process film based stimulation as a ‘story’, to design a system that will assist humans by automating the processing of online social media based video streams and imagery. The significance of this work demonstrates a paradigm shift in how automated video analysis is designed and accomplished through sharing pros and cons of selecting and operationally testing analytics through a series of vignettes. Beginning with an on-line video and concluding with a text based story of that video that is now searchable, understandable, and available to traditional cloud based analytics tailored to an organization's particular needs. This paper will include the results of the customer's experience through the seven stages of the operational experimentation process for Phase 1 of system development.","['Video Intelligence', 'Operational Experimentation', 'Cognitive Ergonomics']",Procedia Manufacturing,2015,Journal,"['Berry, Nina M.', 'Prugh, William', 'Lunkins, Circe', 'Vega, James', 'Landry, Robin', 'Garciga, Leonel']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.598
Psychophysiological evaluation of seafarers to improve training in maritime virtual simulator,"Over the years, safety in maritime industries has been reinforced by many state-of-the-art technologies. However, the accident rate hasn’t dropped significantly with the advanced technology onboard. The main cause of this phenomenon is human errors which drive researchers to study human factors in the maritime domain. One of the key factors that contribute to human performance is their mental states such as cognitive workload and stress. In this paper, we propose and implement an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based psychophysiological evaluation system to be used in maritime virtual simulators for monitoring, training and assessing the seafarers. The system includes an EEG processing part, visualization part, and an evaluation part. By using the processing part of the system, different brain states including cognitive workload and stress can be identified from the raw EEG data recorded during maritime exercises in the simulator. By using the visualization part, the identified brain states, raw EEG signals, and videos recorded during the maritime exercises can be synchronized and displayed together. By using the evaluation part of the system, an indicative recommendation on “pass”, “retrain”, or “fail” of the seafarers’ performance can be obtained based on the EEG-based cognitive workload and stress recognition. Detailed analysis of the demanding events in the maritime tasks is provided by the system for each seafarer that could be used to improve their training. A case study is presented using the proposed system. EEG data from 4 pilots were recorded when they were performing maritime tasks in the simulator. The data are processed and evaluated. The results show that one pilot gets a “pass” recommendation, one pilot gets a “retrain” recommendation, and the other two get “fail” results regarding their performance in the simulator.","['Electroencephalogram', 'Psychophysiological evaluation', 'Human factors', 'Maritime simulator', 'Assessment', 'Maritime training']",Advanced Engineering Informatics,2020,Journal,"['Liu, Yisi', 'Lan, Zirui', 'Cui, Jian', 'Krishnan, Gopala', 'Sourina, Olga', 'Konovessis, Dimitrios', 'Ang, Hock Eng', 'Mueller-Wittig, Wolfgang']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2020.101048
A group decision-making approach to uncertain quality function deployment based on fuzzy preference relation and fuzzy majority,"Quality function deployment (QFD) is one of the very effective customer-driven quality system tools typically applied to fulfill customer needs or requirements (CRs). It is a crucial step in QFD to derive the prioritization of design requirements (DRs) from CRs for a product. However, effective prioritization of DRs is seriously challenged due to two types of uncertainties: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. This paper tries to propose a novel two-stage group decision-making approach to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD. The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers’ fuzzy preference relations into an overall one by fuzzy majority. Two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing approaches. Implementation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and model customer heterogeneity and design team’s preference. Due to its easiness, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in QFD planning. Extensions to the proposed approach are also given to address application contexts involving a wider set of HOQ elements.","['Quality management', 'Uncertain QFD', 'Group decision-making approach', 'Fuzzy preference relation', 'Fuzzy majority']",European Journal of Operational Research,2015,Journal,"['Yan, Hong-Bin', 'Ma, Tieju']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2014.09.017
Manufacturing at double the speed,"The speed of manufacturing processes today depends on a trade-off between the physical processes of production, the wider system that allows these processes to operate and the co-ordination of a supply chain in the pursuit of meeting customer needs. Could the speed of this activity be doubled? This paper explores this hypothetical question, starting with examination of a diverse set of case studies spanning the activities of manufacturing. This reveals that the constraints on increasing manufacturing speed have some common themes, and several of these are examined in more detail, to identify absolute limits to performance. The physical processes of production are constrained by factors such as machine stiffness, actuator acceleration, heat transfer and the delivery of fluids, and for each of these, a simplified model is used to analyse the gap between current and limiting performance. The wider systems of production require the co-ordination of resources and push at the limits of human biophysical and cognitive limits. Evidence about these is explored and related to current practice. Out of this discussion, five promising innovations are explored to show examples of how manufacturing speed is increasing—with line arrays of point actuators, parallel tools, tailored application of precision, hybridisation and task taxonomies. The paper addresses a broad question which could be pursued by a wider community and in greater depth, but even this first examination suggests the possibility of unanticipated innovations in current manufacturing practices.","['Manufacturing', 'Speed', 'Productivity', 'Constraints']",Journal of Materials Processing Technology,2016,Journal,"['Allwood, Julian M.', 'Childs, Tom H.C.', 'Clare, Adam T.', 'De Silva, Anjali K.M.', 'Dhokia, Vimal', 'Hutchings, Ian M.', 'Leach, Richard K.', 'Leal-Ayala, David R.', 'Lowth, Stewart', 'Majewski, Candice E.', 'Marzano, Adelaide', 'Mehnen, Jörn', 'Nassehi, Aydin', 'Ozturk, Erdem', 'Raffles, Mark H.', 'Roy, Raj', 'Shyha, Islam', 'Turner, Sam']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2015.10.028
A mixed perception-based human-robot collaborative maintenance approach driven by augmented reality and online deep reinforcement learning,"Owing to the fact that the number and complexity of machines is increasing in Industry 4.0, the maintenance process is more time-consuming and labor-intensive, which contains plenty of refined maintenance operations. Fortunately, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can integrate human intelligence into the collaborative robot (cobot), which can realize not merely the nimble and sapiential maintenance operations of personnel but also the reliable and repeated maintenance manipulation of cobots. However, the existing HRC maintenance lacks the precise understand of the maintenance intention, the efficient HRC decision-making for executing robotized maintenance tasks (e.g., repetitive manual tasks) and the convenient interaction interface for executing cognitive tasks (e.g., maintenance preparation and guidance job). Hence, a mixed perception-based human-robot collaborative maintenance approach consisting of three-hierarchy structures is proposed in this paper, which can help reduce the severity of the mentioned problems. In the first stage, a mixed perception module is proposed to help the cobot recognize human safety and maintenance request according to human actions and gestures separately. During the second stage, an improved online deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making module with the asynchronous structure and the function of anti-disturbance is proposed in this paper, which can realize the execution of robotized maintenance tasks. In the third stage, an augmented reality-assisted (AR) user-friendly interaction interface is designed to help the personnel interact with the cobot and execute the auxiliary maintenance task without the limitation of spatial and human factors. In addition, the auxiliary of maintenance operation can also be supported by the AR-assisted visible guidance. Finally, comparative numerical experiments are implemented in a typical machining workshop, and the experimental results show a competitive performance of the proposed HRC maintenance approach compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","['Human-robot collaborative maintenance', 'Mixed perception', 'Decision-making', 'Online deep reinforcement learning', 'Augmented reality']",Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2023,Journal,"['Liu, Changchun', 'Zhang, Zequn', 'Tang, Dunbing', 'Nie, Qingwei', 'Zhang, Linqi', 'Song, Jiaye']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2023.102568
It's time to bring human factors to primary care policy and practice,"Primary health care is a complex, highly personal, and non-linear process. Care is often sub-optimal and professional burnout is high. Interventions intended to improve the situation have largely failed. This is due to a lack of a deep understanding of primary health care. Human Factors approaches and methods will aid in understanding the cognitive, social and technical needs of these specialties, and in designing and testing proposed innovations. In 2012, Ben-Tzion Karsh, Ph.D., conceived a transdisciplinary conference to frame the opportunities for research human factors and industrial engineering in primary care. In 2013, this conference brought together experts in primary care and human factors to outline areas where human factors methods can be applied. The results of this expert consensus panel highlighted four major research areas: Cognitive and social needs, patient engagement, care of community, and integration of care. Work in these areas can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of innovations in Primary Care.

Usability is more valuable predictor than product personality for product choice in human-product physical interaction,"Product personality and product usability are two important factors which can influence consumers' product choice. Published literature are available regarding independent impact of product personality and product usability on product choice but no research has been reported so far for understanding their collective influence on product choice. In addition, which factor between usability and product personality contributing more in product choice is still not clear. Current research thus aimed to bridge these research gaps by establishing inter-relationships among product personality, usability and product choice. To achieve this goal, two separate experiments were conducted. Results of first experiment revealed that products having high product usability also possessed strong product personality. Following second experiment, it was observed that solitary influence of product usability on product choice was more than the standalone influence of product personality in human-product physical interaction. Moreover, it unfolded the fact that product usability mediates the influence of product personality towards product choice. Established interrelationships among product personality, usability and product choice, would help designer and ergonomists to decide how product attributes could be manipulated to enhance product personality and/or product usability to ensure product choice. Relevance to industry Techniques mentioned in the current paper for product usability/personality assessment, have significant implication in product design. Gained knowledge will be helpful for industrial designer or human factors experts to incorporate various positive product usability attributes to enhance product personality or vice-versa for assuring acceptance of product in market.","['Cognitive ergonomics', 'Marketing management', 'Product choice', 'Product innovation', 'Product personality']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2014,Journal,"['Chowdhury, Anirban', 'Karmakar, Sougata', 'Reddy, Swathi M.', 'Ghosh, Subrata', 'Chakrabarti, Debkumar']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2014.07.008
Development of a learning factory concept to train participants regarding digital and human centered decision support,"Cyber-physical systems lead to an emerging quantity and quality of data that can be collected and processed within the whole production process.

A human factors perspective on how to keep SAE Level 3 conditional automated driving safe,"The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines Conditional Automated Driving (CAD) or SAE level 3 as the next step in the transition to higher automated driving. A human factors challenge at this level is to keep the fallback-ready user aware of the driving situation. The problem with the widely accepted terminology of SAE is that it does not consider the human factors of achieving this safety-critical transition and lacks in defining a required or appropriate state of fallback readiness and how a human reaches this state. This paper aims to understand how research and industry currently perceive the problem and how they counteract it. We conducted exploratory expert interviews with N = 15 subject matter experts from universities, research centres and vehicle manufacturers. Based on the findings of the expert interviews, we discuss how fallback-ready users might be kept in the loop. The results show that the user should remain physically and sensory in the state of regular drivers to allow a safe transition, which narrows down the problem to maintaining an appropriate cognitive state, level of arousal, and motivational conditions. Lastly, the experts identify that the NDRA should be (a) limited to the onboard-entertainment system and (b) context-aware and (temporarily) restricted or interrupted. We provide concrete design recommendations grounded in (or drawing upon) theoretical frameworks and current human factors expert views and highlight specific challenges that require more research.","['Conditional automated driving', 'Automation supervision', 'Fallback readiness', 'Driver state', 'Non-driving related activity', 'Interruption management']",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,2023,Journal,"['Gerber, Michael A.', 'Schroeter, Ronald', 'Ho, Bonnie']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2023.100959
Activity theory based context model: application for enterprise intelligent assistant systems,"In dynamic working environments such as factory production lines, the process of decisionmaking combines different types of data and knowledge available in different forms. In many cases, elements impacting decisions are not totally mastered by the decision support system since the activity of the user is highly influenced by the dynamic change of the production system. Thus, in order to set the appropriate context elements surrounding different working situations of factory actors, this paper proposes a context model aiming to represents user's activity and the circumstances under the decisionmaking process. The literature of related works highlighted the advantages of context-awareness in supporting the dynamic adaptation of information according to user's context. The proposed model in this paper takes advantage from the context notion and the fundaments of the activity theory proposed in cognitive science. The intended model is used in an intelligent assistant system dedicated to assist factory workers in the manufacturing process. The main purpose of the context model is to help the assistant system in handling the process of knowledge adaptation and therefore, avoiding the problems of overload and misinterpretation of the information.","['context modelling', 'working situation', 'activity theory', 'intelligent knowledge-based systems']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,2015,Journal,"['Dhuieb, Mohamed Anis', 'Laroche, Florent', 'Belkadi, Farouk', 'Bernard, Alain']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.187
Computational and subjective assessment of ventilated helmet with venturi effect and backvent,"The effectiveness of providing venturi effect and backvent in full face ventilated motorcycle helmets to provide thermal comfort to a rider is investigated using Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of air flow and human thermoregulation system in the microclimate of the helmet. Thermal comfort of a motorcycle rider is then predicted using heat indices. The effect of increase in ambient air temperature on the thermal comfort of a rider wearing a modified ventilated helmet, with venturi effect and backvent on the air flow, and temperature distribution in the region above the head is studied. The results are then compared with the conditions when the rider is wearing a full-face, conventional non-ventilated helmet, ventilated helmet with three vents in front and a helmet with only venturi effect. Results are also compared for the conditions when the rider is not wearing any helmet. It is observed that the venturi effect in a ventilated helmet increases the local air velocities in the air gap as compared to a ventilated helmet with three vents in the front of the helmets. Further, it is observed that backvent in venturi helmet augments the thermal comfort of the rider if the ambient air temperature is less than normal body temperature. When air temperatures are higher than the body temperature (36 °C), it is found that the trends are reversed and ventilated helmets are no longer able to provide thermal comfort to the motorcycle rider. For better understanding of effect of newly designed ventilated helmets on the cognitive performance and the willingness of a rider to wear helmets, subjective evaluation of the prototype of venturi helmet is done. Each set of trials required riders to ride with different types of helmets. Based on the results of numerical simulations of ventilation in helmets and responses from subjective human trials, a set of fluid dynamics and design guidelines is also proposed for the helmet manufacturing industries.","['Helmet ventilation', 'Venturi effect', 'Backvent', 'Subjective trials']",International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics,2018,Journal,"['Shishodia, Bhagwat Singh', 'Sanghi, Sanjeev', 'Mahajan, Puneet']",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ergon.2018.07.009
