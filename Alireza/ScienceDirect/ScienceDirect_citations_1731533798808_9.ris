AB  - Each day, airlines face disturbances that disrupt their carefully planned operations. Events like adverse weather conditions, sick crew members, or damaged aircraft often result in delays in the airline's schedule. An airline recovers from such disruptions through the role played by its Airline Operations Control (AOC). A Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach to airline disruption management was recently proposed under the acronym MASDIMA (Multi-Agent System for Disruption Management in AOC). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate this MAS supported AOC approach on its performance and its practical introduction. This is done using a scenario-based analysis to compare the MAS supported policy to human-team based AOC policies. A task-based analysis identifies how well AOC is able to cover a set of tasks using the MAS supported policy. The scenario-based analysis shows that the MAS supported AOC is able to find the optimal solution, and to do this significantly faster. The task-based analysis identified two main challenges for implementing the MAS supported AOC policy: i) to overcome the loss of experience that is caused by significantly automating humans roles in AOC, and ii) to reduce the workload for people that remain in AOC after its introduction. The paper concludes that implementing the MAS supported AOC policy leads to both better and faster resolutions, though the replacement of human roles also poses novel challenges that remain to be resolved: a potential increase in workload for the remaining human role and loss of experience in handling exceptional situations.

AB  - Objective
Despite advances, analysis and interpretation of EEG still essentially rely on visual inspection by a super-specialized physician. Considering the vast amount of data that composes the EEG, much of the detail inevitably escapes ordinary human scrutiny. Significant information may not be evident and is missed, and misinterpretation remains a serious problem. Can we develop an artificial intelligence system to accurately and efficiently classify EEG and even reveal novel information? In this study, deep learning techniques and, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks, have been used to develop a model (which we have named eDeeplepsy) for distinguishing different brain states in children with epilepsy.
Methods
A novel EEG database from a homogenous pediatric population with epileptic spasms beyond infancy was constituted by epileptologists, representing a particularly intriguing seizure type and challenging EEG. The analysis was performed on such samples from long-term video-EEG recordings, previously coded as images showing how different parts of the epileptic brain are distinctly activated during varying states within and around this seizure type.
Results
Results show that not only could eDeeplepsy differentiate ictal from interictal states but also discriminate brain activity between spasms within a cluster from activity away from clusters, usually undifferentiated by visual inspection. Accuracies between 86 % and 94 % were obtained for the proposed use cases.
Significance
We present a model for computer-assisted discrimination that can consistently detect subtle differences in the various brain states of children with epileptic spasms, and which can be used in other settings in epilepsy with the purpose of reducing workload and discrepancies or misinterpretations. The research also reveals previously undisclosed information that allows for a better understanding of the pathophysiology and evolving characteristics of this particular seizure type. It does so by documenting a different state (interspasms) that indicates a potentially non-standard signal with distinctive epileptogenicity at that period.

AB  - Herein, the delamination issue of TiGr(TC4/PEEK/Cf) laminate is addressed by investigating the influence of TC4(Ti-6Al-4V) surface micro-pits on mode-II interfacial fracture toughness of TC4/PEEK interface through experimental and finite element modeling. The micro-pits unit cell, unit strip and the end notched flexure (ENF) models are established based on the finite element simulations and the effect of micro-pit size parameters is studied in detail. The results of micro-pits unit cell model reveal that the presence of micro-pits can effectively buffer the interfacial stress concentration under mode-II loading conditions. Furthermore, the micro-pits unit strip model, with different micro-pit sizes, is analyzed to obtain the interface parameters, which are converted and used in the ENF model. Both the unit strip and ENF models conclude that the presence of interfacial micro-pits effectively improves the mode-II fracture toughness. It is worth mentioning that the utilization of converted interface parameters in ENF model avoided the limitation of micro-pit size and reduced the workload. Finally, the experimental and computational ENF results exhibited excellent consistency and confirmed the reliability of the proposed finite element models. The current study provides useful guidelines for the design and manufacturing of high-performance TC4/PEEK interfaces for a wide range of applications.

AB  - Over the last decades, academics and practitioners have paid much attention to lot-sizing, which determines economic order and production quantities by balancing inventory holding and setup cost. Recently, researchers have started to integrate sustainability issues into lot-sizing models. The focus of these works has been on environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability, however, while only few contributions studied the social aspect of this problem. Especially in in-house logistics, where a high amount of manual material handling is performed, lot-sizing decisions can have a significant impact on workload and human performance, which can have a strong influence on ergonomic parameters and thus worker welfare. The paper at hand extends previous research on ergonomic lot-sizing and introduces a new mathematical model that integrates ergonomic and economic aspects. A rest allowance function is used to take account of recovery periods that help to maintain low levels of fatigue and ergonomic risks. As recovery periods represent non-productive time, the developed integrated model permits to estimate the economic impact of different workload levels. Finally, the model is applied in a numerical study, reflecting a typical manual material handling process. Based on the results of a parametrical analysis, we illustrate the applicability and validity of this approach to different industrial contexts.

AB  - Vibrotactile feedback which can provide real, comfortable and effective interaction experiences has become indispensable in human computer interaction. Many researchers working with vibrotactile feedback in navigation scenarios have proposed a variety of different methods of vibration. However, there is little work that has explored the relationship between navigation speed and vibration feedback both in intensity and modes. In order to find the answer, we implemented a prototype supplying with several vibration feedback modes and designed two exploratory studies to evaluate the human performance with different navigation speeds. We found using a hand-held vibration feedback device can reduce the workload of visual and auditory channels. The results also show that the speed of navigation has a significant influence on the rate of vibration mode identification. This paper contributes to the basic understanding of vibration feedback and offers implications for the future design of vibration feedback in navigation scenarios.

AB  - Touchscreen technology has gained increasing popularity in both personal and public settings. However, button design characteristics that may affect touchscreen use have not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of button design characteristics (i.e., button size, button spacing, visual feedback and button shape) on users’ touchscreen performance, mental workload and preference. Twenty participants participated in an experiment in which they performed both digit and letter input tasks. Button sizes ranged from 7.5 to 27.5 mm with 5-mm increments, while button spacing was absent, 1 mm or 3 mm. Two types of visual feedback (presence and absence) and three button shapes (square, horizontal and vertical rectangles) were examined. Results indicated that button size, button spacing and button shape yielded significant effects on touchscreen performance, while visual feedback had no effect. It is also found that users performed better with medium-to-large size (17.5 mm and larger), square buttons. Mental workload was comparable across button shapes. Users generally preferred button design characteristics that could yield optimal input performance.
Relevance to industry
The findings could facilitate the optimal design of usable touchscreen technology.

AB  - The human cerebral vasculature responds to changes in blood pressure and demands for oxygenation via cerebral autoregulation. Changes in cerebrovascular tone (vasoconstriction and vasodilation) also mediate the changes in blood flow measured by the BOLD fMRI signal. This cerebrovascular reactivity is known to vary with age. In two experiments, we demonstrate that cerebral pulse parameters measured using optical imaging can quantify changes in cerebral vascular tone, both globally and locally. In experiment 1, 51 older adults (age range=55–87) performed a voluntary breath-holding task while cerebral pulse amplitude measures were taken. We found significant pulse amplitude variations across breath-holding periods, indicating vasodilation during, and vasoconstriction after breath holding. The breath-holding index (BHI), a measure of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was derived and found to correlate with age. BHI was also correlated with performance in the Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination, even after controlling for age and education. In experiment 2, the same participants performed a Sternberg task, and changes in regional pulse amplitude between high (set-size 6) and low (set-size 2) task loads were compared. Only task-related areas in the fronto-parietal network (FPN) showed significant reduction in pulse amplitude, indicating vasodilation. Non-task-related areas such as the somatosensory and auditory cortices did not show such reductions. Taken together, these experiments suggest that optical pulse parameters can index changes in brain vascular tone both globally and locally, using both physiological and cognitive load manipulations.

AB  - Man's admiration of the underwater world has been recorded ever since ancient times and to this day, it does not cease to amaze large sections of modern society. Whether for recreational or sport purposes, commercial activities or strategic military operations, the underwater environment plays an amusing yet inhospitable host to its many explorers. Knowledge and respect for our oceans are keys for a sustainable and safe relationship between humans and the underwater. People have often used their ingenuity for adaptation to various environments and the technology for allowing divers to reach extreme places in a safe manner is developing rapidly. This paper will investigate benefits of using robots as diving buddies for aiding underwater navigation. In a typical dive mission scenario, a diver is given relative distance and bearings to an underwater target as he tries to overcome environmental influences to navigate to that target using customary diving equipment; a compass and diving computer/watch. Diving robots can introduce sensors capable of achieving advanced navigation and guiding divers even in low visibility conditions. The experiment in this paper compares these two approaches and validates the results in a simulation environment on 26 participants. The success rate in finding and reaching the targets are compared in terms of time and distance travelled. Finally, the simulation tools are evaluated by participants as well as its potential in developing algorithms and user training using a NASA-TLX workload estimation scale.

AB  - Livestock production systems are strongly influenced by societal constraints which induce changes in their overall chain value organization. In dairy sheep farming, practices such as the male effect (ME) supported by new precision tools (heat detector) can be used to stop the use of hormonal treatments (HT) for heat induction and synchronization. However, the effectiveness of these “hormone-free” (HF) methods for managing ewes’ reproduction remains more uncertain than that of HT. Thus, introduction of HF practices in farms currently managed with HT could imply collateral impacts on the overall functioning of the production system and affect its long-term sustainability. In this work, a new multi-agent model (called REPRIN'OV) was designed to simulate consequences of introducing a HF reproduction management on a series of biotechnical, economic and environmental farm performance indicators, including farmer workload. Three reproduction management scenarios were simulated over five consecutive years for the case study of a French dairy sheep farm considered as conventional (i.e. using HT for reproduction management). They were defined as: use of HTs and insemination (HAI); no use of HTs while preserving insemination practice (HFAI); no use of HTs and direct mating only (i.e., no insemination; HFM). Results confirm that implementing HF reproductive management without accompanying it with further changes in farm management, could negatively impact several indicators of the farm sustainability in the medium and long-term. Indeed, the HF scenarios resulted in overall lower farm biotechnical performances (e.g., −4% for the fertility rate; P < 0.05) due to a more variable heat induction. An increase in farmer's workload during the lambing period (+34% and +33% of h/L of milk in HFAI and HFM, respectively; P < 0.05) was also observed, mainly due to more staggered lambing periods. As for the simulated environmental indicators, they were increased, mostly due to the reduction of the total milk production in HF’s (e.g., +6% of farm methane emissions per L of milk for both HFAI and HFM; P < 0.05). Nevertheless, positive outcomes were also simulated in the HFs as ewes lambing peaks were lower than in HAI suggesting, e.g., a possibility to improve ewes and lamb surveillance during lambing. HF scenarios also led to higher gross margin (GM) per litre of milk produced because no HT was used, reducing the production costs compare to HAI. In addition, implementing insemination in HFAI improved farm milk production and quality (i.e., fat and protein content), which resulted in improved total GM compared to HFM. Still, the reduction in the total milk production in HFs was too important compared with the improvement of the GM per litre, resulting in a reduced total GM in these scenarios (-4% and −5% in HFAI and HFM, respectively; P < 0.05). Overall, simulation results showed that to warrant sustainable introduction of HF strategies (including ME), new frameworks in the organization of key operations at the farm level should be explored (e.g., extending reproduction or milking periods length) and trade-offs should be discussed, considering all involved stakeholders of the dairy sheep industry and the chain’s value requirements. The REPRIN’OV model, may provide an effective tool to simulate the collateral impacts of establishing HF reproductive management and could be used as a decision support system to accompany the ambitious transition towards a HF dairy sheep industry in Europe and beyond.

AB  - Research into road safety has evolved from individual level component analysis to a much broader, systemic approach that acknowledges the fusion of ‘socio’ and ‘technical’ system elements. Over the past four decades, Professor Neville Stanton has contributed to over 179 journal articles, book chapters and conference papers in the field of road safety. The journey from ‘thinking humans’ to ‘systems thinking’ is demonstrated in this paper through the novel application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to the categorisation of research activities. A systematic review of Neville's contributions to the field of road safety demonstrates that over the years, his research activities have evolved from investigating single technological or human performance aspects in isolation (e.g., in-vehicle information design and workload) through to the holistic analysis of much broader systems (e.g., investigating road safety as a whole). Importantly, this evolution goes hand in hand with a change in the focus and emphasis of recommendations for improvements to safety. Going forward, Neville has helped pave the way for fundamental changes and improvements to be made to road safety systems around the world.

AB  - Driver state monitoring (DSM) systems aim to measure driver/occupant state, considering factors such as fatigue, workload, attentiveness, and wellbeing. They are influential for some vehicles on the road today, but as we move towards higher levels of automation their use is expected to become even more important. Uncertainty around public perception of these systems is a potentially limiting factor, with potential concerns for privacy, data storage, perceived utility, and reliability amongst other things posing potential threats. A survey was conducted based on the Universal Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework, which collected 311 individual responses to explore the acceptability of this technology in specific relation to conditionally and partially automated vehicles. This paper identified that the factors of effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and attitudes towards using new technology are all positively related to overall behavioural intention, whereas anxiety is negatively related. Other demographic influences are discussed, and recommendations made for future research and marketing/implementation of DSM systems to ensure acceptance by future users.

AB  - Intelligent and autonomous technology is performing tasks from driving to healthcare, in which calibration of human trust in automation is critical. In this paper, we use a model-based clustering algorithm to identify and model dominant dynamics of human trust in automation among a general population. In doing so, we seek to balance the tradeoffs between a single generalized, or several individualized, models of human trust. We show that two models optimally represent the sampled population and denote the participants in the two clusters as “Followers” and “Preservers”—those with high and low propensities to trust automation, respectively. We compare the dynamics of each partially observable Markov decision process model as well their associated control policies that calibrate human trust while reducing workload in a reconnaissance mission context. The resulting control policies for varying the transparency of an automated decision aid suggest that the use of a generalized control policy would sub-optimally calibrate human trust dynamics in the general population.

AB  - This paper studies the production scheduling problem in a flexible manufacturing system with two adjacent working areas, whose products are incorporated with flexible non-linear process plans and assembling operations. The basic parts are produced in one area before they are transported to the other area for assembly. The assembling structures of products are either flat or multi-levelled. Sequence-dependent setup times of operations and transition times of jobs between machines are considered separately from processing times. Lot streaming is considered beforehand such that each job represents a basic part instead of a batch of identical parts. Identical subassemblies are shared by all possible assembling operations, instead of being pre-associated with any product. Makespan, total tardiness and total workload are taken as objectives to be optimised. We propose a distributed ant colony system to solve the problem and explore the Pareto front. The approach is first compared with other methods, using several sets of hypothetical test cases with different sizes and complexities; then, it is applied to solve a ball valve production scheduling problem under different scenarios. We show that the proposed approach outperforms most of the other methods for the tested problems, especially for large-scale instances, making it a valuable and competitive approach for solving practical production scheduling problems.

AB  - Globalization has driven companies to invest in multi-site production facilities in order to improve service levels and reduce production costs. However, efficient order scheduling schemes are required to balance the load and capacity across the different sites. The present study considers the multi-site production planning problem for a real-world semiconductor wafer ingot-pulling manufacturing company owning five factories in different countries around the world. A two-phase planning model based on a lean-pull strategy is proposed. In the first phase, an available machine sends a request signal to the lean-pull logic to select appropriate orders from the central queue and accumulate them to form a production kanban. In the second phase, the fulfilled orders are assigned to the customers in such a way as to minimize the total shipping cost using a linear programming formulation. The performance of the proposed two-phase lean-pull model is compared with that of the company's existing production planning method under various workload conditions by means of numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed method achieves average improvements in the service level, average cycle time, throughput, machine utilization and profit of 6.03%, 38.48%, 22.52%, 14.26% and 12.48%, respectively. In other words, the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are confirmed.

AB  - Since years, researchers have proposed job rotation as a solution to balance physical workload and reduce ergonomic risk among operators. Simulation is a strong tool for rapid ergonomic analysis, which allows testing different configurations and evaluating the characteristics of different operators. Thanks to such tool, this study proposes a new approach to improve a real system and reduce the ergonomic risk among operators. A real assembly station has been involved in the study and a postural analysis has been performed considering real variables of the system. Different potential workers with different anthropometric characteristics have been tested. The critical situations have been identified and solved proposing different job rotation solutions. Simulation results confirm that job rotation is a good approach to reduce the ergonomic risk and they provide practical guidelines for task assignment.

AB  - The use of riding lawn equipment (RLE) is related to a significant number of accidents every year. To provide basis for product design and enhance user performance and safety, a usability and performance assessment of modern riding lawn-mowing tractor designs and features was conducted in a real-world test environment. Five current commercially available RLEs were tested with response measures including task performance time and accuracy, physiological workload, system usability scores (SUS), and subjective rankings of RLE models. This data was used to identify sensitivity of responses to variations in RLE design features and functionality. The data was also used to assess the validity of new tractor design standard conformance tool, the RLEval methodology. This tool made comprehensive evaluation of RLE models compliance with over 70 specific design standards and was applied by human factors experts. Experiment results revealed sensitivity of all response measures to design differences among the five RLE models, except the objective workload measures. Response measures including task performance, SUSs and subjective rankings showed partial agreement with the RLEval scores. In general, the study results demonstrated a comprehensive experimental methodology for usability and performance evaluations of RLEs as well as merit of using the RLEval as preliminary method to compare design features. Some aspects of the usability experimentation and the RLEval method appear to be complementary.

AB  - The assembly process of high precision products involves a variety of delicate operations that are time-consuming and energy-intensive. Neither the human operators nor the robots can complete the tasks independently and efficiently. The human-robot collaboration to be applied in complex assembly operation would help reduce human workload and improve efficiency. However, human behavior can be unpredictable in assembly activities so that it is difficult for the robots to understand intentions of the human operations. Thus, the collaboration of humans and robots is challenging in industrial applications. In this regard, a human-robot collaborative reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to optimize the task sequence allocation scheme in assembly processes. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified through experimental analysis of the virtual assembly of an alternator. The result shows that the proposed method had great potential in dynamic division of human-robot collaborative tasks.

AB  - Background and objective
Karyotyping is an important technique in cytogenetic practice for the early diagnosis of genetic diseases. Clinical karyotyping is tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. The objective of our study was to develop a single-stage deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN)-based model to automatically classify normal and abnormal chromosomes in an end-to-end manner.
Methods
We analyzed 2,424 normal chromosomes and 544 abnormal chromosomes. A preliminary support vector machine (SVM) model was developed to evaluate the basic recognition performance on the dataset. A DCNN-based model was then proposed to process the same dataset.
Results
By utilizing the SVM model, the classification accuracy of 24 normal chromosomes was 86.01 %. The 32 types of normal and abnormal chromosomes got an accuracy of 85.37 %. The accuracy of the DCNN-based model performing the 24 normal chromosomal classification was 91.75 %. The accuracy of the 32 type classification was 87.76 %. To differentiate eight common structural abnormalities, we obtained accuracies that ranged from 90.84 % to 100 %, and the values of the AUC ranged from 91.81 % to 100 %.
Conclusions
Our proposed DCNN-based model effectively performed the karyotype classification in an end-to-end manner. It had the competence to be used as a prediction tool for abnormal karyotype detection and screening in genetic diagnosis without initial feature extraction. We believe our work is meaningful for genetic triage management to lower the cost in clinical practice.

AB  - Driver visual distraction due to the prevalence of mobile phone engagement has become a major safety concern for transport authorities worldwide. Despite long-term efforts to prevent engagement in mobile phone tasks, drivers continue to use their phones while driving. To develop better policy and prevention practices, gaining an understanding of the predictors and strategies utilised by drivers who use their mobile phone for distracting tasks is necessary. Visually intensive tasks are the main interest of this investigation, e.g., texting and browsing. In an online-questionnaire in Queensland (Australia), of the 484 drivers who participated, a 33.5% (n = 162) of respondents reported using a mobile phone for texting and browsing while driving on a typical day. Answers from these participants were analysed for this study. Negative binomial regression was used to model the effect of the independent variables (personal characteristics, perceived crash risk, beliefs, workload management strategies, and police avoidance strategies) over the rate of texting/browsing events per hour driving. The final statistical model confirmed that drivers who reported previous collisions; who believed that the effects of doing the texting/browsing task would last after it was finished; and who reported keeping their phone low to avoid police had an increased texting/browsing incidence rate. Comparably, drivers who held a valid driving license for longer; who perceived larger crash risk regarding texting/browsing behaviour; who avoided mobile phone use in demanding driving conditions; and who used workload management strategies such as reduced speed when engaged in mobile phone use had a reduced texting/browsing incidence rate. The results provide insights into the limitations of actual enforcement control and potential opportunities for countermeasures.

AB  - With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the features of the technologies that are utilized in broad range of areas are obliged to change according to the new necessities. Especially, the network requirements have to be adopted accordingly in terms of efficiency, transparency, faster pay-outs and asset security. The blockchain technology promises to fulfill the requirements these key aspects of networking impose with the advantages it provides. However, the technology has certain limitations regarding its scalability and its transaction throughput rate. The advantages in security provided by blockchain comes at a cost in terms of scalability and transaction throughput rate. In this paper, a novel decentralized and distributed network architecture is presented. With its novel approach the proposed architecture aims to address these issues with network scalability and to provide an increased transaction throughput rate. Without introducing any centralization with its clusters, the proposed architecture allows the network to utilize its resources much more efficiently and effectively, which allows the participants to focus their efforts on mining, increasing the performance of the network. The architecture also proposes a novel communication handling promoting bulk communications and random workload distribution over the entire network to reduce the bottlenecking that occurs on the peers. A comparison to other state-of-the-art works, namely Bitcoin [1] and Community Clustering [2], is also presented in this paper. The comparison of the collected data shows that the proposed architecture in this paper is able to reduce the overall network latency and provide an increase in the transaction throughout of the network.

AB  - Excellent usability characteristics allow electronic health record (EHR) systems to more effectively support clinicians providing care and contribute to better quality and safety. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) therefore requires all vendors to follow a User-Centered Design (UCD) process to increase the usability of their products in order to meet certification criteria for the Safety-Enhanced Design part of the Meaningful Use (stage 2) EHR incentive program. This report describes the initial stage of a UCD process in which foundational design concepts were formulated. We designed a functional prototype of an EHR module intended to help clinicians to efficiently complete a summary review of an electronic patient record before an ambulatory visit. Cognitively-based studies were performed and the results used to develop a cognitive framework that subsequently guided design of a prototype. Results showed that clinicians categorized and reasoned with patient data in distinct patterns; they preferred to review relevant history in the assessment and plan section of the most recent note, to search for changes in health and for new episodes of care since the last visit and to look up current-day data such as vital signs. These basic concepts were represented in the design, for instance, by screen division into vertical thirds that had historical content to the left and most recent data to the right. Other characteristics such as visual association of contextual information or direct, one-click access to the assessment and plan section of visit notes were directly informed by our findings and refined in a series of UCD-specific iterative testing. Understanding of tasks and cognitive demands early in the UCD process was critically important for developing a tool optimized for reasoning and workflow preferences of clinicians.

AB  - Today's methods for data acquisition usually involve a considerable amount of manual work and, depending on the level of detail, must find a compromise between accuracy and workload. As a result, various typologies of building stocks have been developed. These typologies provide engineers and architects with rough descriptions for classifying buildings into certain periods and construction types. However, real-world applications lack objective decision-making, as these classifications are usually conducted by manual investigations of buildings. To overcome this subjective approach and to ensure the reproducibility of data acquisition, this paper proposes an image-based classification using Deep Learning (DL) methods. We present the acquisition of ground truth and describe the training and testing routines on a dataset of 5,307 images obtained in the city of Weimar (located in the Free State of Thuringia, Germany), a mid-sized city representative of eastern Germany. All building images are linked to an existing building typology, allowing a classification of buildings in ten predefined and acknowledged periods. These periods are ranging from pre-1859 to post-2002. As a benchmark, an expert human baseline is acquired, showing a lower prediction accuracy than the results obtained by DL methods. Our results highlight the potential for automation in image analysis and beneficial impacts for Building Energy Modeling (BEM) on urban scale. Thus, a trustworthy data acquisition regarding the building age holds benefits for various stakeholders in BEM (engineers, architects, policymakers as well as customers).

AB  - This paper designs and implements the automatic invigilation functions using the embedded technology. It proposes a framework for automatic invigilation, which conducts the invigilation functions of the entire examination process. In the examination preparation stage, the framework collects the registration details of examinees and verifies the details with the database through the remote server. During the examination ongoing stage, it keeps checking the consistence between each examinee and his examination materials by photographing the examinee and scanning the QR codes on examination papers, sketch papers, and answer sheets. In the examination ending stage, it checks the consistence of an examination bag and the materials being put into it by scanning and verifying the QR codes on them. The framework reduces the human workload by using automatic functions to replace the human work. The tests demonstrates that the framework can perform the designed functions.

AB  - When interacting with a robot, the level of mental workload, comfort and trust during the interaction are decisive factors for an effective interaction. Hence, current research focuses on the concept, whether ascribing gantry robot in assembly with anthropomorphic movements can lead to a better anticipation of its behavior by the human operator. Therefore, in an empirical study the effect of different degrees of anthropomorphism should be compared. This is based on the scientific research concerning the neural activity of the human brain when watching someone performing an action. Within the study videos of a virtual gantry robot and a digital human model during placing movements were designed to use in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The aim is to investigate the underlying brain mechanism during observing the movements of the two models.

AB  - Vigilance, or sustained attention, is the ability to maintain attention for prolonged periods of time. Interestingly, to date, few studies on vigilance have focused on the role of state motivation in sustaining attention. To address this disparity in the literature, the present study examined the effect of two types of state motivation on vigilance performance across task types (cognitive or sensory) and across the number of displays (one, two, or four). A sample of 105 participants completed a 24-min overload or underload vigilance task in a research laboratory. Participants were randomly assigned to either a cognitive or sensory vigilance task, and were randomly assigned to monitor one, two, or four displays for target stimuli. The results indicated that intrinsic state motivation predicted correct detection performance and state success motivation predicted sensitivity, but not false alarm performance, response bias, or global workload. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical applications of this research.

AB  - Background
Pharmacy information systems (PhIS) can cause medication errors that pharmacists may overlook due to their increased workload and lack of understanding of maintaining information quality. This study seeks to identify factors influencing unintended consequences of PhIS and how they affect the information quality, which can pose a risk to patient safety.
Materials and Methods
This qualitative, explanatory case study evaluated PhIS in ambulatory pharmacies in a hospital and a clinic. Data were collected through observations, interviews, and document analysis. We applied the socio-technical interactive analysis (ISTA) framework to investigate the socio-technical interactions of pharmacy information systems that lead to unintended consequences. We then adopted the human–organization–process–technology-fit (HOPT-fit) framework to identify their contributing and dominant factors, misfits, and mitigation measures.
Results
We identified 28 unintended consequences of PhIS, their key contributing factors, and their interrelations with the systems. The primary causes of unintended consequences include system rigidity and complexity, unclear knowledge, understanding, skills, and purpose of using the system, use of hybrid paper and electronic documentation, unclear and confusing transitions, additions and duplication of tasks and roles in the workflow, and time pressure, causing cognitive overload and workarounds. Recommended mitigating mechanisms include human factor principles in system design, data quality improvement for PhIS in terms of effective use of workspace, training, PhIS master data management, and communication by standardizing workarounds.
Conclusion
Threats to information quality emerge in PhIS because of its poor design, a failure to coordinate its functions and clinical tasks, and pharmacists’ lack of understanding of the system use. Therefore, safe system design, fostering awareness in maintaining the information quality of PhIS and cultivating its safe use in organizations is essential to ensure patient safety. The proposed evaluation approach facilitates the evaluator to identify complex socio-technical interactions and unintended consequences factors, impact, and mitigation mechanisms.

AB  - Today, data analysis drives the decision-making process in virtually every human activity. This demands for software platforms that offer simple programming abstractions to express data analysis tasks and that can execute them in an efficient and scalable way. State-of-the-art solutions range from low-level programming primitives, which give control to the developer about communication and resource usage, but require significant effort to develop and optimize new algorithms, to high-level platforms that hide most of the complexities of parallel and distributed processing, but often at the cost of reduced efficiency. To reconcile these requirements, we developed Renoir, a novel distributed data processing platform written in Rust. Renoir provides a high-level dataflow programming model as mainstream data processing systems. It supports static and streaming data, it enables data transformations, grouping, aggregation, iterative computations, and time-based analytics, and it provides all these features incurring in a low overhead. In this paper, we present the programming model and the implementation details of Renoir. We evaluate it under heterogeneous workloads. We compare it with state-of-the-art solutions for data analysis and high-performance computing, as well as alternative research products, which offer different programming abstractions and implementation strategies. Renoir programs are compact and easy to write: developers need not care about low-level concerns such as resource usage, data serialization, concurrency control, and communication. At the same time, Renoir consistently presents comparable or better performance than competing solutions, by a large margin in several scenarios. We conclude that Renoir offers a good tradeoff between simplicity and performance, allowing developers to easily express complex data analysis tasks and achieve high performance and scalability.

AB  - A work breakdown structure (WBS) can prove to be pivotal to successful project management planning. There are few published studies about the methodologies or tools to develop the appropriate WBS for a project, and those that are available are limited to the specific areas of construction such as apartment-building construction and boiler manufacturing. This research has an emphasis on developing a methodology with higher generalizability, which has the capability to be customized to complex underground projects. To address this issue, a new methodology that employs hierarchical neural networks to develop the WBS of complex underground projects is presented. This methodology has been applied to several tunnel case studies and it has been shown that for a real project, the model is able to generate the WBS and its activities that are comparable to those generated by a project planner. Consequently, it is concluded that these modeling methods have the capacity to significantly improve the WBSs for complex underground projects and improve key project tasks, such as workload planning, cost estimating and scheduling.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is viewed as the most basic worldwide disaster that humankind has observed since the second World War. There is no report of any clinically endorsed antiviral medications or antibodies that are successful against COVID-19. It has quickly spread everywhere, presenting tremendous well-being, financial, ecological, and social difficulties to the whole human populace. The COVID flare-up is seriously disturbing the worldwide economy. Practically all the countries are battling to hinder the transmission of the malady by testing and treating patients, isolating speculated people through contact following, confining huge social affairs, keeping up total or incomplete lockdown, etc. Proper scheduling of nursing workers and optimal designation of nurses may significantly affect the quality of clinical facilities. It is delivered by eliminating unbalanced workloads or undue stress, which could lead to decreased nurse performance and potential human errors., Nurses are frequently asked to leave while caring for all sick patients. However, regular scheduling formulas are not thought to consider this possibility because they are out of scheduling control in typical scenarios. In this paper, a novel model of the Hybrid Salp Swarm Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (HSSAGA) is proposed to solve nurses’ scheduling and designation. The findings of the suggested test function algorithm demonstrate that this algorithm has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches.

KW  - Bayesian data analysis
AB  - In nearly all situations, a person’s performance varies across time (i.e., trials), for example due to vigilance decrements or training. When the performance depends on multiple sources of information, the variation could be either due to changes in processing each source or the efficiency of combining the sources. The capacity coefficient is a frequently used statistic for measuring the efficiency of combining multiple sources of information, but in most applications the analyses assume stationary performance across trials. A trial-varying capacity measure would be valuable in determining the nature of the change over trials but dropping the stationarity assumption results in a severe loss in power. In this work, we develop a Bayesian trial-varying model of the capacity coefficient to estimate the efficiency of an individual processing multiple sources of information. This model is based on the Weibull distribution to approximately characterize the processing time of each source, with an inverse gamma distribution prior for the scale parameter and a known shape. This approach provided us a tractable way to update prior estimates for real-time estimation of capacity across trials. We demonstrate the approach with both simulated and human data.

AB  - In the wake of COVID-19, the production demand of medical equipment is increasing rapidly. This type of products is mainly assembled by hand or fixed program with complex and flexible structure. However, the low efficiency and adaptability in current assembly mode are unable to meet the assembly requirements. So in this paper, a new framework of human-robot collaborative (HRC) assembly based on digital twin (DT) is proposed. The data management system of proposed framework integrates all kinds of data from digital twin spaces. In order to obtain the HRC strategy and action sequence in dynamic environment, the double deep deterministic policy gradient (D-DDPG) is applied as optimization model in DT. During assembly, the performance model is adopted to evaluate the quality of resilience assembly. The proposed framework is finally validated by an alternator assembly case, which proves that DT-based HRC assembly has a significant effect on improving assembly efficiency and safety.

AB  - Technology and its innovative applications make life easier and reduce the workload on seafarers. Today's ship bridges have much more modern and integrated navigation systems than before, and the ship's handling and management have become much easier. However, nonconformities encountered in the use of technological devices may cause accidents. In this study, the effect of human factor related errors associated with the use of the bridge's electronic navigational devices on grounding and collision-contact accidents was investigated. Nonconformities obtained from 175 collision-contact and 115 grounding accident reports were qualitatively analysed by means of human factor analysis and a classification system. Afterwards, relationships between nonconformities and their probabilities were evaluated quantitatively via a Bayesian network method. As a result of the study, the accident network was revealed. This accident network summarizes how operating errors in the use of technological equipment cause accidents. Recommendations on the prevention of accidents caused by operating errors associated with the use of new technologies are finally given.

AB  - Seismic hazard maps are a significant input into emergency hazard management that play an important role in saving human lives and reducing the economic effects after earthquakes. Despite the fact that a number of software tools have been developed (McGuire, 1976, 1978; Bender & Perkins, 1982, 1987; Robinson et al., 2005, 2006; Field et al., 2003), map resolution is generally low, potentially leading to uncertainty in calculations of ground motion level and underestimation of the seismic hazard in a region. In order to generate higher resolution maps, the biggest challenge is to handle the significantly increased data processing workload. In this study, a method for improving seismic hazard map resolution is presented that employs a pipelining implementation of the existing EqHaz program suite (Assatourians & Atkinson, 2013) based on IBM InfoSphere Streams–an advanced stream computing platform. Its architecture is specifically configured for continuous analysis of massive volumes of data at high speeds and low latency. Specifically, it treats processing workload as data streams. Processing procedures are implemented as operators that are connected to form processing pipelines. To handle large processing workload, these pipelines are flexible and scalable to be deployed and run in parallel on large-scale HPC clusters to meet application performance requirements. As a result, mean hazard calculations are possible for maps with resolution up to 2,500,000 points with near-real-time processing time of approximately 5-6minutes.

AB  - Networked Control Systems (NCSs) are pervasively applied in modern industry. With increasing functionalities, modern NCSs tend to have dynamic workload by holding a variety of applications via a shared network. To handle workload variations and provide performance guarantees, dynamic network scheduling scheme is highly desired in NCSs. In this paper, we propose a network scheduling scheme, referred to as DTS, that can make on-the-fly decisions to schedule the applications in NCSs. DTS aims at NCSs that use time-triggered network as shared medium and Time division multiple access (TDMA) as network access method. DTS dynamically changes the network accessing sequence of the applications in a way to provide optimal system performance and maintain control stability in NCSs. DTS adopts a decentralized schedule mechanism where each application can make its local schedule decision, enhancing the scalability of NCSs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by improving the network bandwidth and providing better system performance in NCS comparing with the existing time-triggered scheduling schemes.

AB  - The steel beam to concrete filled steel tube (CFST) column connection with bidirectional bolts has good seismic performance, and it plays an important role in the semi-rigid composite frame. The moment-rotation relation is indispensable in the design of this connection; however, the current moment-rotation relation models require experimental or simulation data to fit their shape parameters and physical parameters, which results in large cost of time, economy, human resource and material resource. Therefore, a practical analytical model for the moment-rotation relation of this connection, i.e. the ultimate moment resistance and initial rotational stiffness based two-parameter exponential model, is proposed. With consideration of the possible failure modes, calculation methods for predicting ultimate moment resistance is developed using dimension parameters and material properties of the connection without any experimental or simulation data. Prediction results based on the proposed analytical model of moment-rotation relation and calculation methods of ultimate moment resistance show good agreements with experimental results, and the failure mode of this connection can also be predicted well. The proposed analytical model can be used in the design and structural analysis of the semi-rigid composite frames to predict the moment-rotation relation accurately; moreover, the proposed model avoids the workload of simulations and experiments, which is simple and convenient for engineers.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a computer-aided engineering (CAE) software toolkit for designers of in-vehicle infotainment systems to predict and benchmark the system usability, such as task completion time, eye glance behaviors, and mental workload. A digital driver model was developed based on the task-independent cognitive architecture of QN-MHP (Queuing Network-Model Human Processor). At the front end of the software a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed that allows designers to create digital mockups of the designs and simulate drivers performing secondary tasks while steering a vehicle. To validate the software outputs, an experiment using human drivers was conducted on a fix-based driving simulator with a radio-tuning task as a test case. Three typical in-vehicle infotainment systems that have the function of radio tuning were investigated (a touch screen, physical buttons, and a knob). The results show that the software was able to generate task completion time, total eyes-off-road time, and mental workload estimates that were similar to the empirical data. The software toolkit has the potential to be a supplemental tool for designers to explore a larger design space and address usability issues at the early design stages with lower cost in time and manpower.

AB  - The task complexity (TACOM) measure was previously developed to quantify the complexity of the proceduralized tasks performed by nuclear power plant main control room operators, and its suitability has been verified by comparing TACOM scores with two different types of human performance data, response times and subjective workload scores. The full appropriateness of the measure has yet to be sufficiently validated though, because of a current lack of comparisons between TACOM scores and associated human errors. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to further confirm the appropriateness of the TACOM measure by comparing human error data collected from a full-scope simulator of a domestic Korean nuclear power plant with the associated TACOM scores. Results show that the number of human errors increases proportionally with an increase in TACOM score. This result strongly implies that the TACOM measure is suited for use as a tool to estimate the complexity of proceduralized tasks, which would act as a key indicator to identify the vulnerable points most likely to lead to operator performance degradation.

AB  - Driver fatigue is the leading cause of truck-related accidents. The most significant occupational fatigue factors among short-haul truck drivers are sleep patterns, the round-trip driving task, and the time-on-task. However, the underlying mechanisms of these influential factors remain unclear. This study aims to explore the interactive effects of sleep patterns, driving task, and time-on-task on driving behavior and eye-motion metrics among short-haul truck drivers. We obtained test data from eleven professional short-haul truck drivers, with each driver participating in a three-day test under the conditions of two driving tasks and three different sleep patterns. We applied three-way repeated-measure ANOVA and non-parametric tests to analyze the data. The results reveal that: (1) violation of sleep-related legal requirements, insufficient sleep, and unreasonable time-on-task can have negative effects on short-haul truck drivers' vigilance and driving performance; (2) both driving task and sleep pattern contribute to driver fatigue, and the interaction of time-on-task and sleep pattern exacerbates driver fatigue more than the effects of any single factor alone; and (3) short-haul truck drivers who are sleep deprived exhibit short periods of controlled compensatory behavior during the outbound task, and sleepiness is more prevalent during the inbound task compared to the outbound task due to the monotony and low workload of the driving process. These findings provide theoretical and practical guidance for transportation industry managers to strengthen company-wide fatigue-related regulations, ensure adequate sleep for drivers via regulations, and optimize work schedules to improve safety outcomes of short-haul truck drivers.

The unique feature of ChaosOrca is that it conducts experiments under production-like workload without instrumenting the application. We exhaustively analyze all kinds of system calls and utilize different levels of monitoring techniques to reason about the behavior under perturbation. We evaluate ChaosOrca on three real-world applications: a file transfer client, a reverse proxy server and a micro-service oriented web application. Our results show that it is promising to detect weaknesses of resilience mechanisms related to system calls issues.

AB  - New market disruption is an important type of disruptive innovation, and it has been recognized as an important innovation activity in engineering field with dynamic development of demand heterogeneity. A systematic approach for generating design schemes of products that may lead to new market disruption is proposed in this paper. The four steps in this approach include the construction of function layer structure, creation of performance layer, components configuration and the system optimization process. In the first two steps, a classification of functional roles and a construct of performance rank are introduced to capture new function sets and determine the realization degree of functions, and eventually realize the differentiated design of functions relative to the existing mainstream product. In the following two steps, two quantitative evaluation formulas are developed to determine which system should be disrupted for a second time and how to optimize the system. The two steps reduce the workload of modifying design scheme iteratively after the prototype had been manufactured, and eventually the design scheme is determined. The approach is applied to generate a disruptive innovative design scheme of a new type of automatic teller machine, and the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach is proved.

AB  - Certain life-threatening abnormalities, such as cholangiocarcinoma, in the human biliary tract are curable if detected at an early stage, and ultrasonography has been proven to be an effective tool for identifying them. However, the diagnosis often requires a second opinion from experienced radiologists, who are usually overwhelmed by many cases. Therefore, we propose a deep convolutional neural network model, named biliary tract network (BiTNet), developed to solve problems in the current screening system and to avoid overconfidence issues of traditional deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we present an ultrasound image dataset for the human biliary tract and demonstrate two artificial intelligence (AI) applications: auto-prescreening and assisting tools. The proposed model is the first AI model to automatically screen and diagnose upper-abdominal abnormalities from ultrasound images in real-world healthcare scenarios. Our experiments suggest that prediction probability has an impact on both applications, and our modifications to EfficientNet solve the overconfidence problem, thereby improving the performance of both applications and of healthcare professionals. The proposed BiTNet can reduce the workload of radiologists by 35% while keeping the false negatives to as low as 1 out of every 455 images. Our experiments involving 11 healthcare professionals with four different levels of experience reveal that BiTNet improves the diagnostic performance of participants of all levels. The mean accuracy and precision of the participants with BiTNet as an assisting tool (0.74 and 0.61, respectively) are statistically higher than those of participants without the assisting tool (0.50 and 0.46, respectively (p<0.001)). These experimental results demonstrate the high potential of BiTNet for use in clinical settings.

AB  - In recent years, research has highlighted the association between increased adipose tissue surrounding the human heart and elevated susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease. However, the manual segmentation of these fat deposits has not been widely implemented in clinical practice due to the substantial workload it entails for medical professionals and the associated costs. Consequently, the demand for more precise and time-efficient quantitative analysis has driven the emergence of novel computational methods for fat segmentation. This study presents a novel deep learning-based methodology that offers autonomous segmentation and quantification of two distinct types of cardiac fat deposits. The proposed approach leverages the pix2pix network, a generative conditional adversarial network primarily designed for image-to-image translation tasks. By applying this network architecture, we aim to investigate its efficacy in tackling the specific challenge of cardiac fat segmentation, despite not being originally tailored for this purpose. The two types of fat deposits of interest in this study are referred to as epicardial and mediastinal fats, which are spatially separated by the pericardium. The experimental results demonstrated an average accuracy of 99.08% and f1-score 98.73 for the segmentation of the epicardial fat and 97.90% of accuracy and f1-score of 98.40 for the mediastinal fat. These findings represent the high precision and overlap agreement achieved by the proposed methodology. In comparison to existing studies, our approach exhibited superior performance in terms of f1-score and run time, enabling the images to be segmented in real time.

AB  - Situational awareness (SA) and fatigue management are crucial aspects of aviation safety, particularly during demanding flight phases. This study introduces an innovative approach employing flight data, machine learning, and Continuous Performance Test (CPT) metrics to predict pilot performance and SA during instrument approaches under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Data were collected from over 10 pilots across more than 40 flights in a high-fidelity Cessna 172 analog flight simulator. Significant correlations were observed between dynamic cognitive performance parameters and the exceedance shape factor, a novel measure of pilot sustained attention introduced in this research. Key variables identified through correlation analysis included variability, interstimulus change, and reaction time standard deviation. Importantly, commission scores and reaction time standard deviation emerged as key predictors in the machine learning model, specifically the Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a radial basis function kernel. The model achieved a validation R-squared of 0.90 and a test R-squared of 0.70. These systems could incorporate additional data sources, such as eye-tracking and scan pattern analysis, for a better assessment of pilot SA and fatigue levels. While post-flight measurements are inherently reactive, they are effective for monitoring the degradation of pilot CPT scores after each leg of high-frequency, short-duration flights. Notable limitations include the need to understand individual cognitive differences among pilots, such as age, experience, and cognitive style. The predictive model also requires validation in actual flight conditions to determine its ecological validity. Future research should aim to address these limitations, generalize the findings, and integrate CPT data with other sensor inputs to provide a more comprehensive understanding of pilot performance.

AB  - Designing highly usable and ergonomic dashboards is fundamental to support users in managing and properly setting complex vehicles, like trains, airplanes, trucks and tractors. Contrarily, control dashboards are usually intrusive, full of controls and not really intuitive or usable. This paper focuses on the design of ergonomic and usable dashboard for specific classes of vehicles, like tractors and trucks. Indeed, trucks and tractors are both vehicles and operating machines, and their control is particularly complex. Indeed, the driver contemporary drives and checks if the machine is working properly. The paper proposes an innovative methodology to design highly usable and compact dashboards inspired by human-centered design and ergonomics principles. The study started by shifting the attention from the machine performance, that is the conventional engineering approach, to the human-system interaction quality, according to a new, transdisciplinary approach. The methodology proposes to combine virtual simulations with human performance analysis to support the design at different stages, from concept generation to detailed design, until testing with users. The methodology uses virtual environments to create digital twins of both driver and controls, making users interact with virtual items and predict the type and nature of interaction. Within virtual scenarios, different configurations of dashboard controls can be easily compared and tested, checking the frequency of use of each control and measuring the achieved human performance related to postural comfort and mental workload. The study adopted the proposed methodology to two industrial use cases focusing on the design of ergonomic dashboards: the former is referred to tractor dashboard and armrest, the latter refers to truck dashboard and seat. Both cases demonstrated that the new methodology allowed improved comfort, higher usability, higher visibility and accessibility, better performance and reduced time for machine control. The study demonstrates how a multidisciplinary user information integration can drive design optimization.

AB  - Sleep spindles are an electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarker of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and have important implications for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. However, it is challenging to accurately detect sleep spindles due to the complexity of the human brain and the uncertainty of neural mechanisms. To improve the reliability and objectivity of sleep spindle detection and to compensate for the limitations of manual annotation, this study proposes a new automatic detection algorithm based on Matching Pursuit (MP) and Least Squares Boosting (LSBoost), where the automatic sleep spindle detection algorithm can help reduce the visual annotation workload of sleep clinicians. Specifically, MP is a time-frequency analysis method suitable for extracting spindle wave characteristics, which can accurately locate spindle waves on a time-frequency plane. LSBoost is an ensemble learning classification method to deal with unbalanced data. Initially, the MP method is used to search for EEG segments that are possible spindle waves from the filtered raw EEG data. Then, the designed feature segments are thrown into the LSBoost classifier to further identify the real spindles from all candidates and output the final results. The proposed method is verified on the common public dataset DREAMS. The experiment results show that the sensitivity and F1-scores based on the sample-based assessments achieve 68.2% and 55.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the Recall and F1-score based on the event assessments are 83.8% and 70.8%, respectively. These results show that the proposed algorithm is robust to the subject changes in the DREAMS dataset. In addition, it improves the quality of sleep spindle detection, which is expected to assist the manual marking of experts.

AB  - This paper explores how the consideration of two important practical aspects related to transportation in the forestry industry, wood moisture content and seasonal limitations on the maximal truck's payload, may lead to savings in procurement costs. To this end, it proposes a multi-period mathematical formulation that decides on the location of potential stockyards and the quantities to move from suppliers to yards and from yards to factories at each period. The formulation accounts for the wood's weight loss achieved by natural drying at the stockyard. Drying depends on the number of periods that the wood stays in the yard but also on the particular weather conditions during the length of stay. The formulation also incorporates the dynamic seasonal restrictions on the allowed payload, in an attempt to mitigate their economic impact on transportation costs. Numerical results on randomly generated instances, as well as a real instance provided by a large pulp and paper producer in Québec, Canada, show that important improvements on the logistics’ costs can be achieved by explicitly considering these aspects.

In this paper, we propose a cognitive model that can dynamically adjust the Levels of Autonomy (LOA) of the human-UAVs team according to the changes in task complexity and human cognitive states. Specifically, we use the Situated Fuzzy Cognitive Map (SiFCM) to model the relations among tasks, situations, human states and LOA. A recurrent structure has been used to learn the strategy of adjusting the LOA, while the collaboration task is separated into a perception routine and a control routine. Experiment results have shown that the workload of the human operator is well balanced with the task efficiency.

AB  - The distortion of machined part caused by the introduction of surface residual stresses in machining and shot peening is a major concern in the manufacture of large structural components. Prediction of those distortions is the key to understand the distortion mechanism and derive optimized machining strategies. In this paper, a high efficient surface based method was proposed to predict the part distortion in machining and shot peening. In this method, the surface residual stress field is mathematically analyzed and equivalent to a group of face and edge loads. The part distortion problem is equivalent to an elastic deformation problem and is solved by the FEM software. The knowledge of surface differential geometry is used so that the method could handle part with curved surfaces. Compared with the existing method, the refinement of mesh in the surface-affected layer is not needed, which not only greatly decreases the workload and difficulty of mesh generation but also significantly reduces the amount of computation. What is more, the method was found to be particular fit for large curved surface parts such as propellers and blades. Software system was developed further to implement the method. Two examples were given to show the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, the method was verified by comparing the simulated results with the experimental data with a marine propeller example.

AB  - The data center industry is responsible for 1.5–2% of the world energy consumption. Energy management technologies have been proposed for energy-efficient scheduling of computing workloads and for allocating resources in such computing infrastructures. One of the important factors for this energy management is the estimation of power consumption as a result of the workload schedule to be carried out. The commonly used power models are a linear function of resource features. Based on measurement data sets from our cluster, we extended power model study to multiple non-linear dependencies. We provide several novel contributions: we apply neural network models and unsupervised classification models with basic OS-reported resource features for power estimation; we build and test the power estimation models in a cluster environment from a large size of measurement data; we evaluate the power estimation models in terms of not only accuracy but also portability and usability. We prove that a multiple-variable linear regression approach is more precise than a CPU-only linear approach. The neural network approaches have a slight advantage – their mean root mean square error is at most 15% less than that of the multiple-variable linear model. The neural network models have worse portability when the models generated on a node are applied on other homogeneous nodes. Gaussian Mixture Model has the highest accuracy but requires the longest training time. In the end, we prove that models trained using the system-level full features have the highest accuracy comparing to only use part of features.

The case study is performed to evaluate the AI-driven techniques and applications using objective metrics, in which several risks and technical facts are obtained to direct future research. Considering the safety–critical specificities of the air traffic control system, a comprehensive subjective evaluation is conducted to collect user experience by a well-designed anonymous questionnaire and a face-to-face interview. In this procedure, the potential risks obtained from the case study are confirmed, and the impacts on human working are considered. Both the case study and the evaluation of user experience provide compatible results and conclusions: (A) the proposed solution is promising to improve the traffic safety and reduce the workload by detecting potential risks in advance; (B) the AI-driven techniques and whole diagram are suggested to be enhanced to eliminate the possible distraction to the attention of air traffic controllers. Finally, a variety of strategies and approaches are discussed to explore their capability to advance the proposed solution to industrial practices.

The authors propose an algorithm based on the Wardrop equilibrium, which is a game-theoretical concept, applied to the federated service discovery domain. The proposed solution has been implemented and its performance has been assessed adopting different network topologies and metrics. An open source simulation environment has been created allowing other researchers to test the proposed solution.

To answer this question, we compare the current research in the field, and we propose a design structure which addresses safety, interfaces and design methods. Our results show safety hardware posing considerable constraints on flexibility. The human interface influences the workload perceived by an operator and, Industrie 4.0 reference architectures do not foresee the human and reconfigurable production cells yet.

The results show that the typical working methods of controllers can be effective in preventing potential conflicts between aircraft, which can contribute to the reduction of controllers’ workload for monitoring and resolving the potential conflicts especially in congested traffic situations. Through the analysis, a part of controllers’ practical knowledge involved in their working methods is demonstrated.

AB  - Among the key technologies of Industry 4.0, Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the most promising and enabling technologies for supporting factory workers and engineers at the workplace. To this end, the paper proposes a novel AR tool to assist operators during the inspection activities for the detection of production and assembly errors. In fact, thanks to the superimposition of the 3D models, as designed by the technical office, a worker can easily detect the presence of design discrepancies on the final physical assembled product and report them by adding 3D annotations directly on virtual models. This AR tool has been developed by using ARCore™ libraries to ensure, in the first place, its compatibility with commonly used devices for which workers are already trained and, secondly, to take advantage of the hybrid-tracking techniques that combine vision- and sensor-based methods to improve the reliability of the AR visualization. Nevertheless, the proposed AR tool adopts multiple markers to minimize tracking errors and therefore to provide greater freedom of movement to the user, who can use the tool also for the assessment of large-size products. Field experimentations have been carried out on a real case study with end-users in order to assess its usability and perceived mental workload through the SUS (System Usability Scale) and NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) standard questionnaires, respectively. The usability study was performed taking into account also objective metrics, i.e., by analysing user performance in target acquisition tasks while interacting with the AR tool. Statistical analysis proved that the adoption of this AR tool requires low mental demand, and its usability has reached a high level of satisfaction both by the factory workers and engineers involved in the user study.

AB  - At present, wind power is one of the most promising clean energy sources. Due to its high variability, accurate wind speed forecasting is an essential part of the wind power industry. This paper proposes a comprehensive forecasting system consisting of three parts: Firstly, the novel SC-EWT wind speed signal reconstruction system proposed in this article can effectively extract information from wind speed signals. Secondly, the QBGA-GRU model is used for signal reconstruction prediction, where QBGA is an improved genetic algorithm proposed in this article that can improve prediction accuracy. Finally, the IPSO-BLS algorithm is used to quickly analyze and predict prediction errors and further correct the predicted results. The system can provide users with adaptive signal decomposition, high-precision deep learning prediction and error analysis functions to achieve efficient and fast short-term wind speed forecasting, which can be used in the fields of wind power integration deployment and wind turbine early warning. The experiments show that the proposed prediction strategy has good predictive ability for wind speed samples in two regions, and its error is smaller than that of commonly used intelligent algorithms. Compared with other models, the proposed comprehensive prediction strategy has better predictive performance and smaller prediction errors than other combination models.

AB  - Human parents require significant support to raise multiple, highly dependent offspring. Grandmothers are often highlighted as key allomothers (non-maternal caregivers) and their presence is frequently associated with increased child survivorship, leading some to describe humans as cooperative breeders. Equally well documented is the diversity of human childcare systems, where a wide range of individuals support parents including male kin. However, the role of grandfathers has been less well documented, and they seem to have an inconsistent relationship with child survivorship, dependent on socio-ecological factors. Here, we explore the relationship between grandparental allomothering and child survivorship using demographic and time budget data from a pastoralists community in western China. We find that under-five mortality is negatively associated with grandpaternal, but not grandmaternal, living status. Pastoralists in Maqu have recently transitioned from mobile to half-settled livelihoods in which women are more economically active than males. As a result, women's childcare workloads have decreased, while older men (who are excluded from the household economy) supervise children. Our results suggest that patterns of childcare are flexible and highlight the need to consider social and ecological factors to understand allomothering and child survival.

AB  - The assembly process is often the final stage of the production process, which implies that the products have a lot of accumulated value hence making errors is expensive at this point of the product life-cycle. Empirical studies show that 90% of the final assembly tasks are still performed by humans and in most cases solely relying on own experience. Because of the product complexity and the operational complexity, caused by the mixed model structure, the mental workload imposed on the operators is typically high. Consequently, the probability of errors is higher and delays may occur. Cognitive automation ensures that the mental workload imposed on the operator will be reduced. This paper will focus on a method for evaluating the performance of a manual mixed model assembly system equipped with a cognitive information system. For this purpose a framework is designed. The framework is categorized in three inner sections: product, workstation and operator data. These sections will define the mixed model assembly system and create a performance score. Further, a technical description of a cognitive information system is given. The cognitive information system will support the operator, both intrinsic and extrinsic, by offering him process related information. The cognitive information systems have three important aspects: what, how and when. Also, configuration opportunities are added to the information system in which the operator is able to configure his own system.

AB  - Assessing operator functional states (OFS) by using neurophysiological signals can provide continuous prediction of instantaneous human performance in safety-critical human–machine systems. Most existing OFS recognizers were built via a subject-dependent manner, where a new model has to be trained based on historical physiological data of the same subject. The main objective of this paper is to generalize such paradigm to cross-subject OFS recognition by exploiting the new improvements in deep learning principles. To this end, we propose a novel EEG-based OFS classifier, switching deep belief networks with adaptive weights (SDBN), which is generic for detecting variations of mental workload, mental fatigue, and the coupling effect of the two variables across multiple subjects. The temporal OFS is predicted by switching the ensembles of the static and adaptive DBNs at each time step via a Gaussian-kernel based criterion. The results comparison demonstrates that the SDBN not only significantly improves classification accuracy but also has the capability to distinguish multiple dimensions in OFS.

AB  - Warning stages and takeover strategies are two key factors that affect the takeover process when highly automated systems fail. However, the interaction between these two factors remains unclear. This study empirically investigated the effect of warning types (two-stage warning vs. single-stage warning) and takeover strategies (interruption vs. multitasking) on human performance. Thirty-eight participants performed three tasks of the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB), in which the system monitoring task was automated and adopted as the takeover task, while tracking and resource management tasks were employed as the initial tasks simultaneously. The results showed that compared with the single-stage warning system, the two-stage warning system enhanced situation awareness, reduced mental workload and improved takeover performance. However, tracking task performance declined when the two-stage warning system was used. Moreover, participants using the two-stage warning system reacted to gauge malfunctions much more quickly than participants using the single-stage warning system when the interruption strategy was adopted. However, there was no significant difference in tracking task performance between the two warning systems when the multitasking strategy was adopted. This study concluded that the two-stage warning system can benefit the takeover process but at the cost of the performance of initial tasks, and the takeover strategy plays an important role in realizing the benefits of the two-stage warning system and alleviating its costs. These findings could provide useful insights for automated system design and personnel training.

AB  - We review the literature on algorithmic management (AM) to bridge the gap between this emerging research area and the well-established theory and research on work design. First, we identify six management functions that algorithms are currently able to perform: monitoring, goal setting, performance management, scheduling, compensation, and job termination. Second, we show how each AM function affects key job resources (e.g., job autonomy, job complexity) and key job demands (e.g., workload, physical demands); with each of these resources and demands being important drivers of worker motivation and their well-being. Third, rejecting a deterministic perspective and drawing on sociotechnical systems theory, we outline key categories of variables that moderate the link between AM on work design, namely transparency, fairness and human influence (e.g., whether workers can control the system). We summarize our review in the form of a model to help guide research on AM, and to support practitioners and designers in the creation and maintenance of meaningful jobs in the era of algorithms.

AB  - We are at the dawn of a huge data explosion therefore companies have fast growing amounts of data to process. For this purpose Google developed MapReduce, a parallel programming paradigm which is slowly becoming the de facto tool for Big Data analytics. Although to some extent its use is already wide-spread in the industry, ensuring performance constraints for such a complex system poses great challenges and its management requires a high level of expertise. This paper answers these challenges by providing the first autonomous controller that ensures service time constraints of a concurrent MapReduce workload. We develop the first dynamic model of a MapReduce cluster. Furthermore, PI feedback control is developed and implemented to ensure service time constraints. A feedforward controller is added to improve control response in the presence of disturbances, namely changes in the number of clients. The approach is validated online on a real 40 node MapReduce cluster, running a data intensive Business Intelligence workload. Our experiments demonstrate that the designed control is successful in assuring service time constraints.

AB  - Introduction
Cyberattacks on healthcare organisations are becoming increasingly common and represent a growing threat to patient safety. The majority of breaches in cybersecurity have been attributed to human error. Intensive care departments are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. The aim of this study was to investigate cybersecurity awareness, knowledge and behaviours among critical care staff.
Methods
This was a multi-site cross-sectional survey study administered to critical care staff. Cybersecurity awareness was evaluated using the validated HAIS-Q instrument. Knowledge and behaviours were evaluated by direct questioning and scenario-based multiple-choice questions. Free text options were also offered to respondents. Thematic analysis was performed on free text sections.
Results
Median scores of 12–15 in each of the HAIS-Q focus areas were achieved, indicating high levels of cybersecurity awareness among critical care staff. However, self-reported confidence in cybersecurity practices, especially identifying signs of cybersecurity breaches and reporting cybersecurity incidents, were relatively low. Participants responses to the scenarios demonstrated a lack of knowledge and awareness of some of the mechanisms of cyberattacks. Barriers to safe cybersecurity practices among staff that emerged from the qualitative analysis included: a lack of training and education; heavy workloads and staff fatigue; perceived lack of IT support and poor IT infrastructure.
Conclusion
Critical care staff appear to have a high-level cybersecurity awareness. However, in practice safe cybersecurity practices are not always followed. ICU departments and hospitals must invest in the human aspect of cybersecurity to strength their cyber-defences and to protect patients.

AB  - A piloted simulator evaluation is an important step for making a Fault-Tolerant Flight Control (FTFC) system more practical and reliable. Especially, in the case of an adaptive technique, conformance of the adaptive controller to the human pilot's intended maneuver must be investigated carefully since the overall control performance will be changed by the additional loop closed by the pilot. In this paper, we present a pilot-in-the-loop simulation of Simple Adaptive Control (SAC) with a PID compensator. By SAC adjusting to the faulty aircraft dynamics, the proposed FTFC system reduces the pilot workload in emergency situations.

AB  - High-performance computing changes the way of computing. More than one-decade, the cloud computing paradigm has changed the way of computing, communication, and technology. The efficient resource provisioning or task scheduler policy improvement is a challenging issue in the service-oriented computing paradigm. This article work focuses on task scheduler policy improvement for better cloud application performance. The task scheduling algorithm aims to improve the performance of real-time applications in the cloud by reducing task waiting time, execution time, and power consumption. The proposed model is inspired by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system with a training model using a genetic algorithm. Results exhibit that the proposed GA-ANN policy outperforms the (Big-Bang Big-Crunch cost-aware), Genetic cost-aware, and other existing approaches. The results show that the proposed GA-ANN model performs better than existing approaches taking power consumption, total completion time(ms), average start time (ms), and average completion time(ms) as performance metrics. The proposed GA-ANN model is validated using real-time user requests (standard workload file) from workload traces (San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Blue Horizon logs), and fabricated data sets. The proposed model improves power efficiency by 13 %, scheduling time by 77.14 % and total execution time by 36 %. Hence the proposed GA-ANN technique provides performance as compared to existing systems.

AB  - The global uptake of Cloud computing has attracted increased interest within both academia and industry resulting in the formation of large-scale and complex distributed systems. This has led to increased failure occurrence within computing systems that induce substantial negative impact upon system performance and task reliability perceived by users. Such systems also consume vast quantities of power, resulting in significant operational costs perceived by providers. Virtualization – a commonly deployed technology within Cloud datacenters – can enable flexible scheduling of virtual machines to maximize system reliability and energy-efficiency. However, existing work address these two objectives separately, providing limited understanding towards studying the explicit trade-offs towards dependable and energy-efficient compute infrastructure. In this paper, we propose two failure-aware energy-efficient scheduling algorithms that exploit the holistic operational characteristics of the Cloud datacenter comprising the cooling unit, computing infrastructure and server failures. By comprehensively modeling the power and failure profiles of a Cloud datacenter, we propose workload scheduling algorithms Ella-W and Ella-B, capable of reducing cooling and compute energy while minimizing the impact of system failures. A novel and overall metric is proposed that combines energy efficiency and reliability to specify the performance of various algorithms. We evaluate our algorithms against Random, MaxUtil, TASA, MTTE and OBFIT under various system conditions of failure prediction accuracy and workload intensity. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ella-W can reduce energy usage by 29.5% and improve task completion rate by 3.6%, while Ella-B reduces energy usage by 32.7% with no degradation to task completion rate.

The well-being of individuals is an essential issue of sustainability research. This study aims to focus on the particular case of teleworkers and the work conditions which may hinder their well-being. More specifically, this study analyses the impact of social isolation and work overload on the work engagement and life satisfaction of teleworkers during COVID-19 pandemic.
Design/methodology/approach
With a sample of 188 workers from the Portuguese banking sector, the authors use structural equations modelling to test a conceptual model. The authors carry out data analysis with partial least squares.
Findings
Social isolation and work overload are both negatively associated with the three dimensions of work engagement, namely, vigour, absorption and dedication. In turn, vigour is positively associated with life satisfaction. Social isolation and work overload are indirectly associated with life satisfaction through vigour. Results from multi-group analysis show that the negative relationship between social isolation and dedication is stronger for less senior teleworkers. By contrast, the negative relationship between work overload and dedication is stronger for more senior teleworkers. Additionally, the positive relationship between vigour and life satisfaction is stronger for permanent workers than for temporary ones.
Originality/value
This study tests the assumptions of the job demands-resources under the novel conditions of telework during COVID-19, focusing its ubiquitous conditions – social isolation and work overload. For human resources managers, this study highlights the need to take seniority and job stability in consideration when devising onboarding and working arrangement strategies for teleworkers.

AB  - Driver distraction is an important factor of accidents. Not only in manual driving, the driver state information is also interesting to consider in automated driving systems in order to provide the driver with a suitable assistance level in respect to his evolving needs. The concepts of adaptive automation and human machine cooperation suggest that the authority of the automation should be adapted in real time according to the situation. However, contrary to existing studies that demonstrated the benefits for continuous fixed haptic feedback in the lane keeping task, evidence regarding the potential benefits of online adaptation of the level of haptic feedback is still lacking. In this framework a study is conducted in order to investigate the effects of online adjusting the authority level of a lane keeping assist system to match the driver’s distraction state while engaging in a demanding secondary task. The study took place in the SHERPA-lamih driving simulator. A comparison has been made between manual driving asa baseline, a Lane keeping Assist (LKA) providing a fixed and continuous haptic feedback and an Adaptive Lane Keeping Assist (ALKA). The analysis accounted for the driving performance and effort along with the subjective ratings of comfort, safety, control and workload. The results were consistent with the previous studies that showed the benefits of fixed haptic feedback under normal driving conditions. Moreover, the study established the benefits of adapting the level of haptic authority when the drivers were engaged in a secondary task. Furthermore, some design issues are highlighted for the design of effective adaptive automation.

AB  - The challenging deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms at the edge pushes the community of embedded computing to examine heterogeneous System-on-Chips (SoCs). Such novel computing platforms provide increased diversity in interfaces, processors and storage, however, the efficient partitioning and mapping of AI/CV workloads still remains an open issue. In this context, the current paper develops a hybrid AI/CV system on Intel’s Movidius Myriad X, which is an heterogeneous Vision Processing Unit (VPU), for initializing and tracking the satellite’s pose in space missions. The space industry is among the communities examining alternative computing platforms to comply with the tight constraints of on-board data processing, while it is also striving to adopt functionalities from the AI domain. At algorithmic level, we rely on the ResNet-50-based UrsoNet network along with a custom classical CV pipeline. For efficient acceleration, we exploit the SoC’s neural compute engine and 16 vector processors by combining multiple parallelization and low-level optimization techniques. The proposed single-chip, robust-estimation, and real-time solution delivers a throughput of up to 5 FPS for 1-MegaPixel RGB images within a limited power envelope of 2 W.

AB  - Background and Objective
The implementation of health information systems (HIS) could overcome obstacles in human resources and infrastructure at primary health care centers (PHCs). This study involved an e-Leprosy framework being integrated into the real setting of a leprosy control program in Indonesia. The objectives of this implementation study were to integrate e-Leprosy into a leprosy control program at 27 PHCs in Pekalongan District. Central Java Province, Indonesia to explore factors related the success or failure of such an implementation regarding the usability, involvement, and acceptance of e-Leprosy by PHC staff and to evaluate the effect of the implementation on leprosy patient attendance at PHCs. This paper is based on the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) statement.
Method
This study used mixed methods implementation research with longitudinal analysis and involved two groups of participants: Leprosy Surveillance Officers (LSOs), patients, and the relatives of patients. This study involved four phases consisting of preparation, baseline assessment, intervention, and evaluation. The qualitative study conducted focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The e-Leprosy program automatically sent SMS reminders regarding leprosy treatment to the LSOs, patients, and patients’ relatives every month.
Findings
This study determined that LSO had difficulties related to their workloads in PHCs while managing information and monitoring treatment and contact after release from treatment. The baseline assessment phase found that LSOs in Pekalongan District were unfamiliar with email but familiar using the internet. Overall, LSOs had a positive perception of the e-Leprosy program. The usability of this e-Leprosy program tended to increase over time, while acceptance of the e-Leprosy exhibited a significant relationship with computer and internet fluency (r = 0.48, p < 0.05) and age (r = 0.621, p < 0.01). The responsible patients correlated (r = 0.67, p < 0.01) with involvement in the e-Leprosy program. This study revealed that patient reminders increased on-time attendance by 13.9 % (p < 0.01 with OR = 2.41).
Conclusion
Factors that should be considered during implementation HIS included the digital gap, PHC’s staff workload, as well as the level of commitment and leadership in the health office.

AB  - The complex geometry and inevitable manufacturing errors of aero-engine blade profile bring difficulties to high-efficiency and high-accuracy measurement. Usually, blade profile is measured by coordinate measuring machine (CMM) in mass production. Since the measurement time and cost increase proportionally as the increase of sampling points, it is essential to study a sampling method that can answer two basically different sampling problems: how many blades need to be sampled from mass production, and how many points need to be measured for a blade. This paper calculates the sample size for statistical analysis with sufficient confidence and accuracy. The correlation analysis for profile deviations of cross sections (e.g. rotation parameters) and cross-sectional points (e.g. point to point normal distances) is conducted, and the proposed method is carried out through traversing the neighboring Spearman rank correlation coefficient and noting low correlations between each other. The studied cases of two real blades indicated that the proposed statistical sampling method can improve measurement efficiency and ensure the measurement accuracy of mass-produced blades.

AB  - Safe work behaviours rely on accurate perceptions of injury risks, and workers who have a misperception of risk can be injured. Despite the importance of perception-action coupling, little is known about modification of those perceptions with changing physical or cognitive STATE. It is hypothesized that changing values for perceived affordances could evidence these modifications. A better understanding of how worker characteristics (e.g., level of fatigue) affect perceptions of affordance and their corresponding behaviours, may help when developing strategies for ergonomic best practices, particularly in manual material handling (MMH) activities. The aim of this study was to compare safe perceptions of affordance from workers that completed repetitive STATE loading. Seventy-five novice MMH workers (23 male; mean age = 21.43, SD = 3.24) made perceived affordances of their safest horizontal reaching distance (acceptable limit) to complete a model task. STATE loading consisted of physical or cognitive fatigue or a control. The levels of fatigue were assessed at five-minute intervals using Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) values and Multi-Fatigue Inventory (MFI) values, respectively. A significant main effect of TIME indicated a decrease of perceived safest reaching distance observed from baseline through subsequent measurements (p<.001). The magnitude of these changes did not differ significantly between groups, suggesting that general learning more than specific STATE loading may be a major contributor to modification of affordance perceptions. However, it remains important to consider TIME and STATE influences on perceptions for safe occupational handling. Novice workers’ initial perceptions of safe working affordance may put them at risk for soft tissue injury. Physical and cognitive loading similarly affect perceived safe affordances.

AB  - Waste sorting facilities rely heavily on plentiful human labour, and the lack of adequately designed work systems leads to musculoskeletal disorders among the workers. The present research explores the ergonomic design aspects of a cost-effective intervention, a work table for waste sorting in developing countries. This study evaluates the appropriate range of work height for the sorting tasks and proper location of hoppers to drop the sorted items. The ergonomic assessment was conducted by simulating postures involved in sorting tasks in a virtual environment and performing a biomechanical evaluation of the static postures by digital human modelling. Thirty male subjects from Indian population simulated the postures of sorting tasks. The compressive force at L4/L5 intervertebral disc, shoulder flexion moment, shoulder abduction moment, and elbow flexion moment were taken as the indicative parameters of the subject's physical workload. The appropriate table height was marginally lower than the elbow height of the subject and within 4 cm. The preferred hopper position was on the floor adjacent to the worker compared with the hopper on the top of the table.

AB  - Over the last decades, academics and practitioners have paid much attention to lot-sizing, which determines economic order and production quantities by balancing inventory holding and setup cost. Recently, researchers have started to integrate sustainability issues into lot-sizing models. The focus of these works has been on environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability, however, while only few contributions studied the social aspect of this problem. Especially in in-house logistics, where a high amount of manual material handling is performed, lot-sizing decisions can have a significant impact on workload and human performance, which can have a strong influence on ergonomic parameters and thus worker welfare. The paper at hand extends previous research on ergonomic lot-sizing and introduces a new mathematical model that integrates ergonomic and economic aspects. A rest allowance function is used to take account of recovery periods that help to maintain low levels of fatigue and ergonomic risks. As recovery periods represent non-productive time, the developed integrated model permits to estimate the economic impact of different workload levels. Finally, the model is applied in a numerical study, reflecting a typical manual material handling process. Based on the results of a parametrical analysis, we illustrate the applicability and validity of this approach to different industrial contexts.

AB  - It is imperative to take proactive measures in light of the escalating concerns about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of international shipping. The GHG study conducted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) indicates that the sector accounted for 2.2% and 2.89 % of emissions in 2012 and 2018, respectively. As a result, IMO has endorsed strategies to reduce ship-induced emissions to 50% by 2050 and net zero emissions by 2100. For reducing carbon emissions, regulations such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) were implemented a decade ago. We collected data from 104 seafarers in 24 countries using purposive sampling, exploring how the energy-efficient operation of ships transforms their work cultures onboard ships. The majority of seafarers in our study agreed that energy-efficient ship operation has changed seafarers' working cultures over the last decade. Seafarers have adopted a variety of energy efficiency (EE) practices, including meticulous record-keeping of fuel consumption and adherence to Planned Maintenance Systems. As well as preparing for Port State Control (PSC) inspections, they follow energy-saving measures prescribed by the SEEMP. In addition to engine maintenance, energy-saving practices, accurate reporting and recording of EE-related data, and efficient power usage, they provide just-in-time arrival, crew training, energy-efficient lighting, environmental awareness, and slow steaming to minimize fuel consumption. The majority of seafarers implemented SEEMP successfully and met the company's objectives, but they did not receive any form of recognition or financial incentives. Although SEEMP can help shipping companies gain financial benefits and preserve the environment, seafarers do not receive tangible rewards or appreciation for implementing it. Only one-fourth of seafarers were rewarded with incentives, bonuses, formal recognition, or trophies. This study holds significant implications for policymakers, offering insight into seafarers' adaptation to energy-efficient ship operations and advocating for integrating Industry 4.0 technologies for EE regulations compliance by reducing seafarers' workloads and improving data accuracy.

AB  - Astronaut's performance is critical to assure success and safety of an outer space mission. For the given mental workload (MWL), astronaut's long-term performance is affected by his/hers human capacity factor (HCF), while the astronaut's short-term performance depends also on his/hers current state of health (SoH). It is suggested that the roles of these human factors (HFs) are quantified by using the double-exponential-probability-distribution function (DEPDF). The underlying physics and attributes of this function in the problem in question are addressed and explained. The general concepts are illustrated by a numerical example.

AB  - Multitasking is one of the most important skills required for human operators to perform highly-complex and safety-critical jobs. This study proposed and validated a quantitative model for the study of user performance improvement in a multitasking environment. The Multi-Attribute Task Battery-II (MATB-II) was used in the experiments as a multitasking platform. The proposed model included quantification of stimuli from each MATB-II subtask as baud rate (bits per second), selection of task difficulty and task weight, as well as the rearrangement of task weights. This research followed a two-phase experimental approach. The first phase applied the proposed model and identified a performance baseline for each individual in a multitasking environment, MATB-II. The second phase validated the proposed model using a rearranged set of multitasks for each individual. Individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) have been estimated as predictors of varying cognitive abilities. This study also investigated the relationship between WMC, task difficulty, and multitasking performance. Significant improvement of user performance was found after the rearrangement of tasks based on the proposed approach. This research provides a framework to quantitatively evaluate multitasking systems and improve human performance in order to understand the interaction between systems and human operators.

AB  - In this paper, we integrate two decision problems arising in various applications such as production planning and project management: the project scheduling problem, which consists in scheduling a set of precedence-constrained tasks, where each task requires executing a set of skills to be performed, and the workforce allocation problem which includes assigning workers as scarce resources to the skills of each task. These two problems are interrelated as the tasks durations are not predefined, but depend on the number of workers assigned to that task as well as their skill levels. We here present a mixed integer linear programming model that considers important real life aspects related to the flexibility in the use of human resources, such as multi-skilled workers whose skill levels are different and measured by their efficiencies. Hence, execution times of the same workload by different workers vary according to these efficiencies. Moreover, the model considers the flexible working time of employees; i.e. the daily and weekly workload of a given worker may vary from one period to another according to the work required. Furthermore, efficient team building is incorporated in this model; i.e. assigning an expert worker and one or more apprentice worker(s) together with the purpose of skill development thanks to knowledge transfer. A numerical example is provided to check the performance of the model.

AB  - Organizational Design and Management (ODAM) elements of Ergonomics and Human Factors (E/HF) apply to congress organization. Exemplary delegate and organizer E/HF experience is constrained by shifting requirements, time pressures and financial constraints. E/HF application while organizing the International Ergonomics Association's Triennial Congress in 2021 (IEA2021) is described focusing on delivery platforms considering typical and exceptional (pandemic) constraints, emphasizing ODAM E/HF principles and generalizable lessons. Post-Congress feedback from delegates, session chairs and Congress organizers reveal the Congress as experienced. Presenting virtually allowed on-demand recording access following live sessions and increased question-and-answer flexibility. Frustrations included navigating multiple platforms and insufficient communications. Stakeholders’ differing expectations increased organizer workloads and delegate frustration. Maximum virtual presentation benefits require efforts to ensure integrated, human-centered platform development. Simply digitizing traditional Congress sessions ignores potential enhancements. Embracing innovations would help meet delegate communication needs via careful selection and deployment of evolving virtual meeting technologies. Organizational learning strategies can support these efforts.

AB  - Human attention has bottlenecked today’s ubiquitous computing environment where users are consuming increasing amounts of information from numerous applications and services. Since the system-to-user provision of information is becoming more proactive, mainly via push notifications that often cause interruption at the users’ side, attention management is becoming very important. Despite the many existing studies concerned with detecting opportune moments to present such push information to the users (in a way that preserves the user’s attention and lowers their cognitive load and frustration), there is little evaluation of such systems in the real-world production environments. Overlooked areas of study also include the examination of real users and notification contents. In this paper, we present various results from the first extensive evaluation on user’s interruptibility and engagement in the real-world environment with a market-leading smartphone application that boasts a large number of users, including real notification content on the application. Following our previous mobile-sensing and machine learning-based interruptibility estimation approach, which was an effective study in its own right (Okoshi et al., 2015 [18,19]), we embedded a logic with the same approach in the “Yahoo! JAPAN” Android app (one of the most popular applications on the national market). The results from our large-scale in-the-wild user study (that included more than 680,000 users and spanned three weeks) indicate that, in most cases, delaying the notification delivery until an interruptible moment is detected is beneficial to users. The practice results in significant reduction of user response time (49.7%) when compared to delivering the notifications immediately. We observed a higher number of notifications opened in our system and constant improvement in user engagement levels throughout the entire study period. We also observed differences in click rates among different days and time among users with different attributes (e.g., age, gender, and occupation). Additional evaluation of our revised system, which can train and distribute different models for weekdays and weekends, improved the click rates during weekends. This negated the performance degradation previously observed during weekends.

AB  - Cross-docking is a logistics strategy for direct distribution of products from a supplier or manufacturing plant to a customer or retail outlet with little or no handling and storage time. The classical cross-docking models are used to find the optimal inbound/outbound truck schedule that minimizes the total operational time. We propose a new multi-period cross-docking model with multiple products, due dates, variable truck capacities, and temporary warehouse. The problem is formulated as mixed-integer programming and an evolutionary computation approach based on a genetic algorithm (GA) is designed to solve it. The structure of the chromosomes, the operators, and the constraint handling strategy are specifically designed for multi-period problems. Several test instances have been generated to compare the performance of the proposed GA with that of a branch and bound solution procedure. Moreover, a comprehensive statistical analysis is conducted to illustrate the performance efficacy of the proposed GA relative to the branch and bound algorithm. This analysis reveals that the GA provides a substantial decrease in the computational burden when compared to the branch and bound algorithm.

AB  - Non-ergonomic working conditions are the leading causes of musculoskeletal disorders that seriously affect human health. REBA is widely used tool due to its convenience and consideration of all body parts. However, it heavily relies on the subjective judgments of the assessor, leading to inconsistencies in results, and lacks sensitivity in detecting small changes in ergonomic risk factors. Therefore, there is a need to improve the REBA method by integrating it with new technologies. While a few studies have proposed integrating ergonomic risk measurement tools with ANNs, there is a research gap in comparing different types of neural networks and membership functions to determine the most effective approach for improving the performance of REBA. Additionally, there is a need to apply these integrations to real-life case studies to demonstrate their effectiveness in practice. This study proposes a comparative neural network and neuro-fuzzy-based REBA method that includes various types of neural networks and membership functions. The proposed method is applied to service employee who have experienced increased workloads due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The results show that the neuro-fuzzy method is more accurate than the REBA and provides greater flexibility in defining which member belongs to which risk level cluster. This study is critical because it addresses research gaps in integrating neural networks and REBA and applies these integrations to a real-life case study. By comparing different types of neural networks and membership functions, the study provides insights into which approaches are most effective for improving the performance of REBA.

AB  - Spontaneous facial self-touch gestures (sFSTG) are performed manifold every day by every human being, primarily in stressful situations. These movements are not usually designed to communicate and are frequently accomplished with little or no awareness. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether sFSTG are associated with specific changes in the electrical brain activity that might indicate an involvement of regulatory emotional processes and working memory. Fourteen subjects performed a delayed memory task of complex haptic stimuli. The stimuli had to be explored and then remembered for a retention interval of 5min. The retention interval was interrupted by unpleasant sounds from The International Affective Digitized Sounds and short sound-free periods. During the experiment a video stream of behavior, 19-channel EEG, and EMG (of forearm muscles) were recorded. Comparisons of the behavioral data and spectral power of different EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) were conducted. An increase of sFSTG during the application of unpleasant sounds was observed. A significant increase of spectral theta and beta power was observed after exploration of the stimuli as well as after sFSTG in centro-parietal electrodes. The spectral theta power extremely decreased just before sFSTG during the retention interval. Contrary to this, no significant changes were detected in any of the frequencies when the spectral power before and after instructed facial self-touch movements (b-iFSTG and a-iFSTG) were compared. The changes of spectral theta power in the intervals before and after sFSTG in centro-parietal electrodes imply that sFSTG are associated with cortical regulatory processes in the domains of working memory and emotions.

AB  - Platooning, whereby automated vehicles travel closely together in a group, is attractive in terms of safety and efficiency. However, concerns exist about the psychological state of the platooning driver, who is exempted from direct control, yet remains responsible for monitoring the outside environment to detect potential threats. By means of a driving simulator experiment, we investigated the effects on recorded and self-reported measures of workload and stress for three task-instruction conditions: (1) No Task, in which participants had to monitor the road, (2) Voluntary Task, in which participants could do whatever they wanted, and (3) Detection Task, in which participants had to detect red cars. Twenty-two participants performed three 40-min runs in a constant-speed platoon, one condition per run in counterbalanced order. Contrary to some classic literature suggesting that humans are poor monitors, in the Detection Task condition participants attained a high mean detection rate (94.7%) and a low mean false alarm rate (0.8%). Results of the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire indicated that automated platooning was less distressing in the Voluntary Task than in the Detection Task and No Task conditions. In terms of heart rate variability, the Voluntary Task condition yielded a lower power in the low-frequency range relative to the high-frequency range (LF/HF ratio) than the Detection Task condition. Moreover, a strong time-on-task effect was found, whereby the mean heart rate dropped from the first to the third run. In conclusion, participants are able to remain attentive for a prolonged platooning drive, and the type of monitoring task has effects on the driver's psychological state.

AB  - Introduction
Although self-driving vehicle technology has been developing rapidly in recent years, there are still many challenges left before full autonomy can possibly be achieved. Remote operation could facilitate the development of autonomous vehicles in a safe and efficient manner by putting a human in the loop without the need for the human to be physically present in the vehicle. In the current experiment, three aspects of remote driving have been investigated in a driving simulator to evaluate the effect of i) latency, ii) type of task to perform, and iii) speed on a number of performance measures.
Method
Thirty-one participants drove in simulated rural (high-speed) and urban (low-speed) scenarios. Five hazards were created for each scenario and the participants drove each scenario three times with different latencies (baseline, +100 ms, and +200 ms). The latency condition was masked for the participants. The hazards were designed with the intention of creating challenging traffic situations. For example, in hazard one (H1) a car parked next to the road activates their turn indicators and then cuts into the participant’s lane close in front of the ego vehicle, forcing the participant to either brake or veer. Latency, type of hazard, and scenarios (high- and low-speed) were all within participants’ variables. Objective simulator data collected included variables such as reaction time, post-encroachment time, speed variation, distance to hazard, collisions, etc. Subjective data was gathered through questionnaires between each of the balanced latency conditions to assess trust, perceived control, realism of scenarios, and workload etc. After the completed drive, participants were asked to rate in which order they believed they had been subjected to the different latencies. The participants were divided into two groups, experienced drivers and experienced gamers.
Result
The results of the simulator study show that for some of the hazards, but not all, there were significant differences in the latency conditions and there were interaction effects between participant groups and environment/speed. For example, in H1 the effect on the reaction time was significantly larger than the added latency. Overall, the experienced gamers drove with larger safety margins although they had not been told that the latency was varied. Speed, latency, and group characteristics were interacting in significant ways and affected performance measures. The subjective ratings show that participants experienced less control of the vehicle during higher latency conditions, even though they were not told in which order they had been subjected to the latency conditions. The separate tasks to perform were affected differently by the independent measures. The number of collisions was not affected by latency.
Conclusion
There seems to be a certain level of adaptivity among the participants, although they were not told that the latency varied between scenarios, and they could also not guess in which order they drove with the different conditions. In some situations, they drove with larger safety margins, especially experienced gamers in the high-speed scenario. Moreover, the subjective ratings show that participants felt less in control of the vehicle at higher latencies without being able to pinpoint what it was that affected their driving.

Utilizing coherence method to quantify phase synchronization between EEG nodes, signal activities are converted into graph representations. After a complex-theoretic approach is conducted, intelligent brains emerge as more connected ones under resting state. Male brain, featuring lower connection strength and efficiency under resting state, exhibits the ability to boost up connectivity under mental workload. On the other hand, arithmetic success correlates with high resting state connectivity for all EEG bands but dominantly for gamma band, while unsuccessful brains yield greater beta band assortativity behavior. Theta band associated with unconscious actions apparently exhibits greater connection weights for mental activity compared to resting. Contributions of EEG bands to diagnosing differences in rest/task, gender and arithmetic success states are detailed within the study. We also spot out which connection patterns are related with mental progressing, outlining that intelligent brains yield less inter-frontal and more frontal to central and frontal to parieto-occipital connections.

AB  - A computed tomography (CT) scan may be composed of hundreds of two-dimensional image slices. Therefore, doctors who diagnose rib fractures using CT may feel fatigued given the nature of the process, resulting in missed diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis is an effective means to reduce missed diagnosis. In this study, based on the difficulties associated with computer-aided rib fracture diagnosis, we conduct the following two tasks. Firstly, a data cleaning algorithm is proposed. Given the lack of publicly available CT rib fracture datasets, a CT rib fracture dataset is established using real clinical data collected from hospitals cleaned by this algorithm, which provides a good trade-off between human resource consumption and cleaning accuracy. Secondly, we propose a slice grouping and aggregation network (SGANet) model, which can classify the cases of rib fracture via three processes. Initially, several consecutive slices are merged into a group by three-dimensional (3D) convolution. Subsequently, the high-level features of each slice group are extracted by two-dimensional (2D) convolution to simulate the process through which doctors observe changes in the rib in the adjacent slice group with one slice as the center. Finally, the features of different groups are aggregated by 3D convolution for classification. The efficacy of the model is verified by a clinical dataset with the ground truth established by experienced doctors, and the results demonstrate that the missed diagnosis rate of rib fractures can be significantly reduced, albeit with a slight increase in the workload on doctors. Source code and dataset is available at https://github.com/jjjpg/SGANet.

AB  - How can we be sure that sufficient safeguards are in place and safety level is acceptable? As we heard Prof. Nancy Leveson stating at last year's MKOPSC symposium, even with all components functioning, dysfunctional component interaction can still be a cause of mishap. Human factor expert, Prof. Erik Hollnagel, asserts it in even stronger terms: the Efficiency-Thoroughness Trade-off principle, or rather dilemma, contends that one can hardly do it perfectly well. Perfect thoroughness, certainly in complex situations, requires an amount of time with which efficiency will be in conflict. For improved situational awareness, sufficient resilience, and adequate risk control, we must adopt a top-down system approach. Hazard scenarios possible in the system, with all its entangled interactions of hardware, procedures, and humans shall be identified bottom-up and causal relations made clear. Fortunately, in recent years two potentially helpful tools have become available: Blended Hazid, a vastly improved, heavily computerized system approach making use of HazOp and FMEA, and Bayesian networks, a tool to model cause–effect structures allowing inclusion of uncertainty information. Bayesian networks as an infrastructure enable also the use of indicator values to relate the result of safety management effectiveness, which expresses itself as safety attitude of employees, competence, workload, and motivation, with their effects on error and failure probability. This paper will explain the directions these developments are advancing and the openings they provide for further process safety research and risk assessment, which when applied will result in improved process risk control.

AB  - Human interpretation of images during image annotation is complicated, but most existing interactive image annotation systems are generally operated based on social tagging, while ignoring that tags are insufficient to convey image semantics. Hence, it is critical to study the nature of image annotation behaviors and process. This study investigated annotation tactics, transitions, strategies and their efficiency during the image annotation process. A total of 90 participants were recruited to annotate nine pictures in three emotional dimensions with three interactive annotation methods. Data collected from annotation logs and verbal protocols were analyzed by applying both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings of this study show that the cognitive process of human interpretation of images is rather complex, which reveals a probable bias in research involving image relevance feedback. Participants preferred applying scroll bar (Scr) and image comparison (Cim) tactics comparing with rating tactic (Val), and they did fewer fine tuning activities, which reflects the influence of perceptual level and users’ cognitive load during image annotation. Annotation tactic transition analysis showed that Cim was more likely to be adopted at the beginning of each phase, and the most remarkable transition was from Cim to Scr. By applying sequence analysis, the authors found 10 most commonly used sequences representing four types of annotation strategies, including Single tactic strategy, Tactic combination strategy, Fix mode strategy and Shift mode strategy. Furthermore, two patterns, “quarter decreasing” and “transition cost,” were identified based on time data, and both multiple tactics (e.g., the combination of Cim and Scr) and fine tuning activities were recognized as efficient tactic applications. Annotation patterns found in this study suggest more research needs to be done considering the need for multi-interactive methods and their influence. The findings of this study generated detailed and useful guidance for the interactive design in image annotation systems, including recommending efficient tactic applications in different phases, highlighting the most frequently applied tactics and transitions, and avoiding unnecessary transitions.

AB  - Introduction
High-intensity driver stress (DS) is not only an important cause of vehicle collision accidents, but also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the sudden onset of illness in drivers. This article presented a systematic review to explore the key factors and influencing mechanisms that cause or affect the fluctuation of the DS level in the traffic situation, road conditions, and driving environment.
Methods
We reviewed the research on DS since 2013 and identified 61 peer-reviewed articles published. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to guide the literature search and quality assessments after categorizing and commenting on the studies, the experimental design methodologies, research scope, and research topics are further reviewed, and suggestions are put forward.
Results
The traffic density (n = 6), traffic behavior(n = 6), and traffic control (n = 4) are the main traffic situation factors; the road type (n = 14) and geometric design (n = 6) are the main road condition factors; weather, light, and landscape conditions (n = 6) are the external driving environment factors; and the air quality, in-vehicle devices (n = 7), and trust and takeover problems caused by human–machine interaction (n = 16) are the internal environment factors. These impacts on DS are reflected in the behavior of drivers, as well as their physiological and psychological states.
Conclusion
The future experiments must be conducted with multi-dimensional tasks, and multi-modal fusion methods; more abundant research is needed to explore the impacts of the high complexity of urban traffic and landscapes, the interactions between drivers and assisted driving systems, as well as the mixed driving mode of autonomous and manual vehicles on DS. Based on the different generation mechanisms of DS under different conditions, strategies, and suggestions for the alleviation of DS are proposed from the perspectives of driving assistance, traffic control, and landscape construction.

AB  - Typically, in the shipbuilding industry, several vessels are built concurrently, and a production plan is established through a hierarchical planning process. This process largely comprises strategic planning (long-term) and master planning (mid-term) aspects. The portion that requires the most manual work of the planner is the load balancing in the master planning stage. The load balancing of master planning is an area where optimization studies using mixed integer programming, genetic algorithms, tabu search algorithms, and others have been actively conducted in the field of operational research. However, its practical application has not been successful due to the complexity and the curse of dimensionality, which is dependent on the manual work of the planner. Therefore, a new method that can facilitate the efficient action of optimal decisions is required, replacing conventional production planning methods based on the manual work of the planner. With the advent of the 4th industrial revolution in recent years, machine learning technology based on deep neural networks has been rapidly developing and applied to a wide range of engineering problems. This study introduces a methodology that can quickly improve the load balancing problem in shipyard master planning by using a deep neural network-based reinforcement learning algorithm among various machine learning techniques. Furthermore, we aim to verify the feasibility of the developed methodology using the ship block production data of an actual shipyard.

AB  - Multi-core systems are any computing device nowadays and stream processing applications are becoming recurrent workloads, demanding parallelism to achieve the desired quality of service. As soon as data, tasks, or requests arrive, they must be computed, analyzed, or processed. Since building such applications is not a trivial task, the software industry must adopt parallel APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that simplify the exploitation of parallelism in hardware for accelerating time-to-market. In the last years, research efforts in academia and industry provided a set of parallel APIs, increasing productivity to software developers. However, a few studies are seeking to prove the usability of these interfaces. In this work, we aim to present a parallel programming assessment regarding the usability of parallel API for expressing parallelism on the stream processing application domain and multi-core systems. To this end, we conducted an empirical study with beginners in parallel application development. The study covered three parallel APIs, reporting several quantitative and qualitative indicators involving developers. Our contribution also comprises a parallel programming assessment methodology, which can be replicated in future assessments. This study revealed important insights such as recurrent compile-time and programming logic errors performed by beginners in parallel programming, as well as the programming effort, challenges, and learning curve. Moreover, we collected the participants’ opinions about their experience in this study to understand deeply the results achieved.

AB  - This paper proposed two psychophysiological-data-driven classification frameworks for operator functional states (OFS) assessment in safety-critical human-machine systems with stable generalization ability. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) are combined and used for binary and multiclass feature selection. Besides typical binary LSSVM classifiers for two-class OFS assessment, two multiclass classifiers based on multiclass LSSVM-RFE and decision directed acyclic graph (DDAG) scheme are developed, one used for recognizing the high mental workload and fatigued state while the other for differentiating overloaded and base-line states from the normal states. Feature selection results have revealed that different dimensions of OFS can be characterized by specific set of psychophysiological features. Performance comparison studies show that reasonable high and stable classification accuracy of both classification frameworks can be achieved if the RFE procedure is properly implemented and utilized.

AB  - This paper seeks to elicit and structure the factors that shape the execution and, in particular, the coordination of work in Out of Hours care. Evenings and weekends in UK hospitals are managed by specific Out of Hours (OoH) care arrangements, and associated technology. Managing care within the constraints of staff availability and demands is a key concern for both patient care and staff wellbeing, yet has received little attention from healthcare human factors. A study of sixteen clinical staff used Critical Decision Method to understand how work is coordinated and the constraints and criteria that are applied by the roles managing OoH care. The analysis identified ten types of coordination decision that, in turn, underpinned three types of adaptive behaviour – pre-emption, information augmentation and self-organisation – that were crucial for the effective performance in OoH care. These behaviours explain how OoH staff manage the task demands placed on them, individually and as a team.

AB  - The paper presents issues related to methods used in breast histopathological images tumor changes detection. The problem is connected with sustainable health issues which focus on the improvement of health and better delivery of healthcare, rather than late intervention in disease, with resulting benefits to patients and to the environment on which human health depends, thus serving to provide high quality healthcare. The main purpose of the paper is to develop a model based on deep artificial neural networks for the cancer detection in histopathological breast images. The implementation of the proposed model fits in with the concept of sustainable health through the support of the work of doctors in their decisions, diagnosis and in the reduction of the human workload and time, which can be referred to improve the health services. Data set contains 277524 samples from 163 breast histopathological images taken with the WSI scanner. The model is based on a convolutional neural network in the ResNet-18 architecture, which consists of residual blocks. During the final validation on the test set, the network achieved an accuracy of 93.6% and a 87.3% sensitivity in the detection of cancer tissues. The overall performance of the model is characterized by an F1-score of 0.887. The obtained results indicate the possibility of using the system in clinical conditions.

AB  - The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which is a reflexive eye movement generated in the direction opposite to that of the head movement, is affected by mental workload(MWL). A computational model to estimate the VOR from head movement has been proposed. Previous research has shown that when humans perform mental tasks, the error between the measured and the estimated VOR (calculated with the mathematical model) increased. Previously, a computational model for estimating the VOR was proposed; this model, known as the 6DOF-SVC model considered several processes of self-motion estimation. Further, another study revealed that a parameter in this computational model representing self-motion estimation changed as a result of volition of the head movement. This result indicated that the activeness or passiveness of the head movement influenced the outcome. However, the relationship between added mental tasks and the model self-motion estimation parameter has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in this study, an experiment to investigate the effect of mental tasks on the modeling error and the model parameter was implemented. Specifically, movements of the eye and head were measured when participants were exposed to a pitching vibration with and without a mental task to perform. The experimental results showed that the modeling error increased and the model self-motion estimation parameter decreased with the addition of a mental task. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the model parameter and the VOR gain, which was calculated from the peak eye and head angular velocities.
