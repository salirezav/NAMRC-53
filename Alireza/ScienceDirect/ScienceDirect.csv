The degree of variant diversity increasesalongthe value chain. Hence, assembly is forced to deal with the highest diversity. These fluctuating workloads affect the utilization rate in multi model assembly lines. Thereby, constant cycle times lead to losses in time due to the model mix. Furthermore, losses can result from gaps between exact workloads and human capacities in the workstations.Optimal operating points are defined as the ideal combination of concurrent sub goals like utilization rate and throughput rate. The identification of such operating points for assembly lines with planned product sequences shows up as a task for capacity planning and line balancing. Several analytic line balancing methods were developed in the past aiming for instance at minimal cycle times. However, methods for operational decisions on cycle time and overall production capacity are still rare. Simulation methods show potential to fill this gap. They allow the modeling and simulation of specific and complex production systems. This paper describes a planning method and a simulative tool for the identification of optimal operation points. The aim of optimal operating points is a reduction of time losses due to the model mix.Based oncurrent approaches for simulative line balancing, a planning tool has been developed. Working with defined product sequences, thistool supports the variation of parameters like the cycle time. Effects on productivity and time losses can be analyzed. Optimal operating points can be identified. Furthermore, the tool can visualize specific product sequences with corresponding workloads during the shift. It supports staff decisions on improvements in production. Moreover, results can be used for decisions on staff planning and staff development. The tool has been validated by a case study in a truck assembly line.",

For manufacturing companies, it becomes imperative to assess the operational and economic advantages derived from these technologies. Simultaneously, in alignment with the Industry 5.0 paradigm, understanding the influence of digital technologies on human workers, especially those directly interacting with these technologies, is equally critical. This study focuses on augmented reality (AR) as a specific technology, conducting an experimental campaign to explore its effects on learning curves and cognitive workload. Voluntary participants engaged in learning manual tasks of varying durations and required dexterity. This study evaluates the impact of AR on the mental workload of operators, utilising two main eye-related measures: fixation duration and pupil diameter. Preliminary results indicate that augmented reality increases the cognitive workload of workers undergoing training.",19

As a consequence, human assembly workers will need to adapt quickly to new and more complex assembly procedures, which are most likely to increase cognitive workload, or potentially induce overload. Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workers’ cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload.",
3,JOUR,Safety evaluation and prediction of takeover performance in automated driving considering drivers’ cognitive load: A driving simulator study,"['Liu, Yongjie', 'Wu, Chaozhong', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Ding, Naikan', 'Xiao, Yiying', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Tian, Kai']",Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,103,35,52,2024,2024/05/01/,,1369-8478,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trf.2024.03.021,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847824000664'],"['Conditionally automated driving', 'Takeover request (TOR)', 'Safety performance', 'Cognitive load', 'Eye movement', 'Driving simulation']","Automated vehicles alleviate the need for driver attention and control. However, a takeover request (TOR) to the driver remains essential for emergencies and safety–critical scenarios beyond automation's capability. Thus, accessing drivers’ safety performance in various TOR scenarios is crucial for conditionally automated driving (SAE L3). However, TOR safety performance is seldom examined concerning drivers' cognitive load, despite its presumed relevance to TOR scenarios and human–machine interaction. Moreover, the adequacy of the time window preceding a TOR, critical for TOR safety prediction, remains inadequately explored. This study aims to assess safety performance across diverse TOR scenarios in Level 3 conditional automation, incorporating drivers’ cognitive load, and predict TOR safety by considering the time window's impact. A driving simulator experiment gathered eye movement and driving behavior data from 37 recruited participants. Participants were instructed to take control of the vehicle from automated driving within a time budget (TB) of 3 s or 7 s in obstacle avoidance (OA) or lane keeping (LK) scenarios while engaging in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). Participants’ subjective cognitive load in the different TOR scenarios was scaled using NASA-TLX. Furthermore, safe TOR performance was predicted utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) across different time window sizes preceding a TOR. The results indicate that: 1) cognitive loads in takeover scenarios ranked from highest to lowest as TB = 3s_OA, TB = 3s_LK, TB = 7s_OA, TB = 7s_LK; and the cognitive loads of the NDRTs ranked from highest to lowest as mistake finding, texting, chatting, monitoring; 2) the takeover safety performance in the four scenarios from lowest to highest was TB = 3s_OA, TB = 3s_LK, TB = 7s_OA, TB = 7s_LK; likewise, the takeover safety performance during the four NDRTs ranked from lowest to highest as mistake finding, monitoring, texting, chatting; 3) the time window size before the TORs significantly affected the prediction performance of the model. A 30-second window was recommended as optimal for predicting takeover safety using the CNN model, achieving an average F1 score of 0.8120 and 81.98 % accuracy. This study's findings enhance our comprehension of driving behavior characteristics during TOR and offer valuable insights for detecting driver states in conditionally automated driving contexts.",

This emerging technology introduced novel human-computer interaction paradigms that would have impact on pilot's cognitive demands. The objective of this research was to evaluate both the pilot's perceived workload and SA while interacting with an AR device using different interactive modes. Participants performed traditional landing checklists as a baseline to compare with the AR gesture-command and voice-command checklists. The research results showed that gesture-commands created additional cognitive and physical demands. Conversely, voice-command checklists could constitute a significant improvement in terms of reducing participants' perceived workload and maximising SA performance. The findings provided evidence that the interactive modes of AR user interface design could influence participant's cognitive information processing and perceived workload in flight operations. However, there were some limitations with AR applications that included latency on response time, narrow field of view, accuracy of voice recognition, calibration within dynamic environment and inexplicable movements of the head position that required further investigation. An AR device can be a great tool for training at the initial stage to increase cost-efficiency in flight operations. Furthermore, the implementation of an AR design may provide part of the potential solution for single pilot operations in the future.",

For this reason, it has been widely embraced in various industrial fields, especially for helping operators assemble products. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a debate in the research community about how effective AR is for improving user performance in assembly tasks, particularly when using handheld devices. These disparities can be attributed to differences in experimental approaches, such as the frequent use of qualitative methods, the inclusion of non-representative users, and the limited number of comprehensive case studies. In response to this, the paper delved into the benefits of AR applications, with a specific focus on measuring user performance and the cognitive workload perceived by users during assembly activities. To this end, an AR assembly guidance tool has been developed to assist users during assembly tasks, running on a mobile device, specifically a tablet, for freedom of movement and high portability. Experimentation involved the assembly of a comprehensive case study and a diverse user group, allowing the comparison representative users and experienced industrial operators. The results were promising, indicating that AR technology effectively enhances user performance during assembly-guided activities compared to conventional methods, particularly when users are unfamiliar with the task at hand. This study brings valuable insights by addressing previous research limitations and providing strong evidence of AR's positive impact on user performance in real-world assembly scenarios.",

For such a problem, we present a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that linearizes and incorporates into the SALBP the Occupational Repetitive Action (OCRA). This well-known method gives ergonomic risk indicators for musculoskeletal disorders. A lexicographical approach to address the problem is proposed, where the minimum number of stations is obtained for SALBP and used as a starting point to solve a type-F ErgoSALBP (feasibility problem) focused on satisfying the maximum ergonomic risk workload. Once the exact solution is found, we establish an objective function to smooth the ergonomic risk distribution among stations. We tested a total of 2160 instances with up to 297 tasks. Our method was able to solve 94% of all instances optimally. The share of solutions found with only green stations (the ideal ergonomic condition) was 87%, surpassing the state of the art. For the instances where the model did not converge to a solution within the time limit, we present a procedure to assess the optimality gap. Furthermore, the model can be embedded as a building block for other assembly line configurations. Finally, the results provide trade-off insights for managers: the average OCRA for the line improves as the cycle time increases, which may positively impact workers’ satisfaction and product quality in the long run.",

The evaluation of CLAM was performed in a demonstration factory focusing on manufacturing of street scooters and electric pedal cars. The modified walkthrough was conducted on the shop floor, during on-going assembly, which stresses the representativeness of a real-world setting of manufacturing. The modified pluralistic walkthrough functioned accurately as an evaluation method of CLAM and the exhaustive comments and data from the user representatives were very beneficial.

In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.",

The first is an ergonomic analysis of the workstations to evaluate the physical workload of different jobs. An in-house risk assessment method was used to identify physical workloads of each job. In the second step, a mathematical model was developed to schedule job rotation and optimize/balance the cumulative workload. Mixed integer programming is proposed to implement a platform for the ergonomic job rotation. The objective of the job rotation programming in this research was to determine the optimal sequence of jobs for each worker such that the global daily workload of the workers would be balanced.

A line is balanced if the maximum total execution time of any station is minimal. Commonly, the task execution order is constrained by precedences, and task execution times are independent of the station performing the task. Here, we consider a recent variation, called the “(Calzedonia) Workload Allocation Problem” (WAP), where the precedences form a chain, and the execution time of a task depends on the worker executing it.

Reconfiguration of this line is a major practice in industry, which is known as two-sided assembly line balancing problem of type-II. To solve this NP-hard problem, this paper proposes an improved discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm via blending idle time reduction techniques. The cycle time compression mechanism speeds up the search process by reducing total idle times to a larger extent on earlier iterations. Task assignment rule is specifically designed to eliminate sequence-dependent idle times. The overload and underload are taken into account as a secondary objective to reduce the remaining idle times. To achieve a fine balance between the diversification and intensification, the employed bees in the DABC algorithm generate new food sources by combining the features of two solutions, and the onlookers expand the search space with the variable neighborhood search. Nine recent meta-heuristics including a simulated annealing algorithm and an ant colony optimization algorithm are also extended for the TALBP-II to test the performance of the proposed DABC algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the nine compared algorithms and find 22 brand-new results for large-size problems.",

To that end, we used a virtual reality (VR) adaptation of a well-established neurocognitive test for executive functions, the ‘Color Trails Test’ (CTT). The VR-CTT involves performing 3D reaching movements to follow a trail of numbered targets. To tease apart the cognitive and motor components of task performance, we included two additional conditions: a condition where participants only used their eyes to perform the CTT task (using an eye tracking device), incurring reduced motor demands, and a condition where participants manually tracked visually-cued targets without numbers on them, incurring reduced cognitive demands. Our results from a group of 30 older adults (>65) showed that reducing cognitive demands shortened completion times more extensively than reducing motor demands. Conditions with higher cognitive demands had longer target search time, as well as decreased movement execution velocity and head-hand coordination. We found larger pupil sizes in the more cognitively demanding conditions, and an inverse correlation between pupil size and completion times across individuals in all task conditions. Lastly, we found a possible link between VR-CTT performance measures and clinical signatures of participants (fallers versus non-fallers). In summary, performance and pupil parameters were mainly dependent on task cognitive load, while maintaining systematic interindividual differences. We suggest that this paradigm opens the possibility for more detailed profiling of individual cognitive-motor performance capabilities in older adults and other at-risk populations.",

An excessive workload can lead to fatigue or accidents, while an insufficient workload may diminish situational awareness and efficiency. However, existing supervised learning-based methods for workload recognition are ineffective when dealing with imperfect input data, such as missing or noisy data, which is not practical in real applications. This study introduces a robust Electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled cognitive workload recognition model using self-supervised learning. The proposed method, DMAEEG, combines the training strategies of denoising autoencoders and masked autoencoders, demonstrating strong robustness against noisy and incomplete data. More specifically, we adopt the temporal convolutional network and multi-head self-attention mechanisms as the backbone, effectively capturing both the temporal and spatial features from EEG. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on an open dataset and a self-collected dataset. The results indicate that DMAEEG performs superior to other state-of-the-art across various evaluation metrics. Moreover, DMAEEG maintains high accuracy in workload inference even when EEG signals are corrupted with a high masking ratio or strong noises. This signifies its superiority in capturing robust intrinsic patterns from imperfect EEG data. The proposed method significantly contributes to decoding EEG signals for workload recognition in real-world applications, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of human-automation interactions.",

As a result many manufacturing companies face an increasing variety of their product range. As it is not profitable to install new assembly lines for each product, assembly lines have to be able to handle different products in batch size one. In literature these lines are called mixed-model lines. They follow the logical principal of flow production but are capable of producing different products while needing minimal modification of assembly processes at the workstations. While mixed-model lines help manufacturing companies handling product differences profitably, they result in a number of challenges for the production process. One major challenge is related to the varying assembly times at a single workstation due to different products. Actions have to be taken to cope with assembly time that is over cycle time, in order to avoid stops in a flow production. For economical reasons manufacturing companies have to be able to work at a high workload utilization on average. Therefore it is necessary to have a detailed look at the workstations’ situation regarding production time variety. To address this, an analytical framework for assembly lines, based on a mixed-model line principle, is given to identify workstations that face high complexity regarding production time variety. This analytical framework contains several aspects focusing on production time variety as drifting probability, utilization and statistical dispersion. By using this framework, companies can apply their actions and line balancing more precisely to the situation at a workstation. Thus, manufacturing companies are able to handle complexity effectively and to reach a high workload utilization in their mixed-model assembly line.",

Some researchers explored the task assignment plan for the assembly line balancing problem with the assumption that the assembly process is smooth with no disruption. Other researchers considered the impacts of disruptions, but they only explored the task re-assignment solutions for the assembly line re-balancing problem with the assumption that the re-balancing decision has been made already. There is limited literature exploring on-line adjustment solutions (layout adjustment and production rate adjustment) for an assembly line in a dynamic environment. This is because real-time monitoring of an assembly process was impossible in the past, and it is difficult to incorporate uncertainty factors into the balancing process because of the randomness and non-linearity of these factors. However, Industry 4.0 breaks the information barriers between different parts of an assembly line, since smart, connected products, which are enabled by advanced information and communication technology, can intelligently interact and communicate with each other and collect, process and produce information. Smart control of an assembly line becomes possible with the large amounts of real-time production data in the era of Industry 4.0, but there is little literature considering this new context. In this study, a fuzzy control system is developed to analyze the real-time information of an assembly line, with two types of fuzzy controllers in the fuzzy system. Type 1 fuzzy controller is used to determine whether the assembly line should be re-balanced to satisfy the demand, and type 2 fuzzy controller is used to adjust the production rate of each workstation in time to eliminate blockage and starvation, and increase the utilization of machines. Compared with three assembly lines without the proposed fuzzy control system, the assembly line with the fuzzy control system performs better, in terms of blockage ratio, starvation ratio and buffer level. Additionally, with the improvement of information transparency, the performance of an assembly line will be better. The research findings shed light on the smart control of the assembly process, and provide insights into the impacts of Industry 4.0 on assembly line balancing.",

Nevertheless, allowing changes to customer-specific product configurations until late steps into the final assembly can be a competitive advantage as long as the negative effects on the assembly line can be mitigated. This paper proposes a method to efficiently handle such configuration changes while keeping the disruption of the assembly line as minimal as possible. The method assesses the criticality of change requests based on their severity and the assembly progress of the product. Based on this categorization an optimal time slot during the assembly process is identified to perform any additional work associated with a change request. These additional work contents can occur from necessary disassembly and different or additional assembly processes. The validation of the method for a final assembly line of large and complex products showed that it can reduce the additional workload by 26 % and the prolongation of the throughput time by 78 % on average.",

Despite the rapid progress made in the field, complete automation is not always possible. Often robots cannot replace workers’ flexibility, and sometimes there is no economically viable option for automation. A combined production system with both manual and automated parts could be the best configuration in such circumstances. Even with partial automation the number of workers in the line could be decreased, and workers’ safety and health conditions could be dramatically improved. In this paper, MILP models are suggested to compare the total workload of workers when different numbers of robots are applied in an assembly line with partial automation and the minimum possible number of workers. The proposed MILP model is implemented in the AIMMS modelling environment and solved using CPLEX. The presented models can help evaluate the impact of adding robots to the line on total workers’ workload and may assist decision makers in finding the best possible line configuration.",10

This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATB, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity.",

Despite the high level of automation achieved in production systems, flexibility is often provided by human dexterity and the cognitive capabilities of the workforce, as in assembly lines. In the case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In these contexts, a high production rate leads to high physical workload, and job rotation is adopted in order to reduce the ergonomic risk. Traditionally, ergonomics and human performance issues have been investigated separately. However, in the design and scheduling of human-based manufacturing systems, a reliable description of human components is required in order to jointly evaluate production system performance and assess workers׳ risk of MSDs In this paper, the authors propose a model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is a mixed integer programming model allowing for the maximization of production rate jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the OCRA (OCcupational Repetitive Actions) method (ISO 11228-3:2007), widely recognized as an effective tool for the risk assessment of Upper Limb Work related MSDs (UL-WMSDs). Moreover, the different workers׳ performance due to their respective training levels and skills is considered in the problem formulation. The model is applied to an industrial case study. Results show the model׳s capacity to identify optimal job rotation schedules jointly achieving productivity and ergonomic risk goals. Performances of the solutions obtained improve as workforce flexibility increases.",

Since reduced cognitive load ensures that pilots will operate the aircraft safely and effectively, it is critical to evaluate pilot cognitive load during HMI. A cognitive load assessment method, based on multi-criteria decision-making, is proposed to accurately quantify the relationship between the HMI and the cognitive load in the fighter’s cockpit. Firstly, based on the integrated Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and MEthod based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC) methods are used to assign subjective and objective weights, respectively. Moreover, the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method is applied to rank the scenarios to establish a cognitive load assessment model for the cockpit HMI of the fighter jet. Secondly, an evaluation standard system of fighter cockpit HMI is proposed, drawn upon multiple sets of eye-movement criteria and subjective assessment criteria. Moreover, cognitive load experiments of fighter cockpit HMI are conducted using eye-tracking technology to get the objective physiological cognitive data as well as the subjective assessment data of the subjects. Consequently, the parameter data sets of the eye-movement criteria and the subjective criteria for the evaluation of cognitive load are obtained. The proposed method is applied to analyze the cognitive load assessment of a fighter jet cockpit HMI layout. This application aims to verify the effectiveness of the assessment method in evaluating the cognitive load of the HMI layout. Through sensitivity and comparison analyses, the model was further verified to have excellent robustness and applicability for cognitive load assessment. The advantages of this method can be seen through the comparison, which is that it has higher discriminability when assessing the degree of cognitive load. At the same time, it has higher flexibility in dealing with complex and ambiguous cognitive load assessment information.",

Human error may be considered as a result of additional supplementary tasks on top of an accustomed workload. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of workload on human performance. To achieve this, a TRANSAS simulator series 5000 was used to replicate a real scenario with the addition of workload as a PSF. Each participant engaged in a fault detection and correction task. 20 participants were used for the workload study; all 20 were trained for 3 h to use the engine room software interface. The participants then completed a 30-min ballasting task. During this interaction, 50% of the participants underwent a simulated scenario where the workload was increased. The other 50% were given a standard task. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure the participant's activation levels, more specifically from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of the cerebrum. The results showed an increase in activation of the DLPFC during each phase of the task, this trend was magnified by the addition of increased workload. The results are discussed with respect to human performance during varying workload. From the results of this study, a human classification performance model was developed. This model can be used by the maritime industry to better evaluate and understand human error causation.",

After the simulation, a flight instructor used a standardized method to evaluate student pilot's individual cognitive workload from video-recorded flight simulator data. Results indicated that HRV was able to differentiate flight phases that induced varying levels of cognitive workload; an increasing level of cognitive workload caused significant decreases in many HRV variables, mainly reflecting parasympathetic deactivation of cardiac autonomic regulation. In conclusion, autonomic physiological responses can be used to examine reactions to increased cognitive workload during simulated military flights.

These functions are the basis of models that describe human behavior and neural mechanisms for diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and stroke-related cognitive dysfunction. Such models can enhance our understanding of the disease processes and enable crucial applications like predicting cognitive trajectories for early diagnosis. However, despite the success of these models in predicting early-stage cognitive impairment and decline, their practical use is limited in clinics because most of the models focus on utilizing one or two factors of the neurophysiological activation to achieve prediction. Still, little is known about the mechanisms through which the task difficulty and cognitive demands affect the expression of neurophysiological activation and whether there is an expression difference under cognitive task demands. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive examination of the neurophysiological expression difference and mechanisms under various cognitive loads. We designed an experimental protocol and developed a data processing framework to explicitly examine brain activity and eye movement under various levels of cognitive task difficulty and find that (1) eye movement is a readout of cognitive processes, but it is a joint function of task difficulty, brain activity, and skin conductance; (2) brain activity has specific patterns related to the various levels of cognitive load and exerts its influence on predicting the dynamics of cognitive processes. These findings suggest that neuroimaging studies comparing task-related neurophysiological activation must be examined and interpreted in a holistic view of neural mechanisms.",

Our index SX involves for each station the quadratic deviation of its workload from the average (or ideal) workload and is therefore closely related to the variance, which is a common measure of dispersion in statistics. Contrary to the existing literature on workload smoothing in ALB, which often treats the optimization of a prespecified smoothness index as a secondary objective, we consider our SX-objective as the single one in order to account for the practical relevance of fair workload distributions and avoiding overloaded bottleneck stations. To optimally solve SALBP-SX, we develop a tailored branch-and-bound procedure. It contains a new station-oriented branching scheme, new lower bound arguments, logical tests and, in particular, a dynamic programming scheme for the pre-calculation of potential workloads, which accelerates the procedure greatly.

Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.",

Although, a growing number of researchers addressed ALBP over the past fifty years, real-world assembly systems which require practical extensions to be considered simultaneously have not been adequately handled. This study deals with an industrial assembly system belonging to the class of two-sided line with additional assignment restrictions which are often encountered in practice. Teaching–learning based optimization (TLBO), which is a recently developed nature-inspired search method, is employed to solve the line balancing problem. Computational results are compared with the current situation in terms of the line efficiency, and the solution structure with workload assigned to the stations is presented.",

The unpaced variant of these lines employs a conveyor to discretely move pieces between stations either synchronously or asynchronously. Workload balancing and product sequencing are common optimization problems associated with these lines. While many works detail balancing and sequencing separately, few explicitly combine these degrees of freedom. Furthermore, hybrid (i.e. partly synchronous and partly asynchronous) lines are not explicitly described by previous optimization models. This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming model capable of representing such unpaced lines and explicitly combine balancing, sequencing and cyclical scheduling. The application of the proposed method to a new dataset demonstrates the advantages of simultaneously balancing and sequencing lines, generating more efficient solutions than previously described models for 238 out of 240 instances. These results implied, however, in greater computational costs required to combine the degrees of freedom. Furthermore, a direct performance comparison study between synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid lines is conducted. This allows line designers and managers to explicitly evaluate economical trade-offs between these line types.",

Yet, its potential impact on worker well-being has been less explored. As the National Association of Manufacturers anticipates an opening of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, the necessity for frameworks that not only understand but also improve employee well-being becomes apparent. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive visual emotion recognition framework that incorporates facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotional body posture recognition (EBPR) to assess workers’ psychological states. This initiative aims to mitigate human errors and accidents linked to stress or high cognitive load, thereby enhancing the manufacturing environment. Strategies such as optimized break time planning, line balancing, procedure modifications, and improved training are proposed to ensure both employee well-being and stakeholder benefits. This framework indirectly supports the industry’s efforts to address the looming challenge of unfilled jobs by fostering a supportive work environment that enhances job satisfaction, potentially making positions more appealing and retaining valuable talent. By bridging the gap between technological advancements and human-centric considerations, our approach underscores the significance of integrating IIoT solutions with employee welfare initiatives to address both productivity and workforce sustainability challenges.",

This work aims to protect the manager’s interest by predicting the comfortable work-duration time of an assembly line worker for a given work, based on the working condition and the instantaneous physical & mental status of the worker. The comfortable work-duration time can be used during the worker’s work assignment to reduce interruptions. Factors, which influence the longevity of workers’ comfortable work duration time are identified. IIoT based sensors are proposed here to monitor the relevant factors for diagnostics.

In this paper, we extend and improve the branch-and-bound procedure SALSA (Simple Assembly Line Smoothing Algorithm) of Walter et al.

Like SALSA, it is based on a dynamic programming scheme which pre-determines potential workloads of the stations and provides a construction plan for possible station loads. This scheme is extended by the new concept of supporters and preventers which significantly enhances branching, bounding, and logical tests. Furthermore, a tailored heuristic that searches for improved initial solutions, a bidirectional branching scheme and additional dominance rules are integrated. In extensive computational experiments, we find out that our new procedure clearly outperforms all former exact solution procedures on benchmark data sets with up to 1000 tasks.",1

Nowadays, assembly lines have to face the manufacturing of extremely personalized products (e.g. cars) as requested by an increasingly higher portion of the market demand. Several literature contributions focus on different balancing problems affected by the wide variety of the final product, e.g. mixed and multi model assembly lines. However, no contribution seems to tackle the personalized production of goods. Such products require to assemble a certain number of tasks whatever the final product personalization is, and a variable number of optional of different type determined by the specifications of every single costumer. This paper faces the generalized assembly of personalized goods proposing an innovative two step methodology to optimize the workload balancing between the assembly line stations, considering traditional tasks and the optional required by the product personalization, which could occur with different frequencies and pairings. The first phase of the developed methodology executes a clustering of product options required by the costumers based on a similarity index. This phase leads to the definition of several sets of optional typically requested together by the customer and with similar mounting time. The methodology second phase leverages the defined clusters of optional. Indeed, optional of the same cluster shouldn’t be assigned to the same workstation to reduce the overload or underload of the assembly operators. An integer programming model is proposed to assign both traditional tasks and optional to stations, to maximize the assembly line balancing considering the order frequency and assembly time of the clusterized optional. An industrial case study is adopted to test and validate the proposed two steps methodology. The obtained results highlight a consistent time balancing between assembly line workstations and a significant limitation of the operator overloads.",2

Thus, the aims of this study are: i) to evaluate the impact of a five-day survival at sea simulation on human adaptive capacities, based on the assessment of psychological, cognitive, physiological, and sensorial measures; and ii) to assess recovery. Twenty-one healthy participants were enrolled in a 5-day simulation onboard a lifeboat or an inflatable raft. Psychological, physiological, sensory, and cognitive measurements were recorded before leaving (baseline), at the end of the experiment (post) and during the week that followed (recovery). Our results are unequivocal. The harshness of the environment affected the majority of the organism's responses. On the cognitive level, performance significantly deteriorated. On the psychological level, there was low mood, a decrease in subjective exteroceptive acuity and sleep disorders, increased energy, and less perceived stress. On the physiological level, a decline was recorded with respect to autonomous nervous system measurements. On the sensory level, we observed a state of hypervigilance and hypersensitivity to stimuli from the external environment. Proprioception was deeply impacted. Moreover, at recovery, many individuals did not fully recover or deteriorated further, especially regarding sleep, interoceptive abilities and sensory distortion. It appears that participants entered a state of psychological hibernation, associated with increased physical and cognitive load, and sensory hypervigilance. These results raise the question of the risks that may be incurred during future long-term space missions, as astronauts will have to maintain their cognitive performance at a high level to be able to respond to environmental demands and remain alive.

However, the initial balance can be broken by the changing processing abilities of machines because of machine degradation, and at some point, re-balancing of the line is inevitable. Nevertheless, the impacts of unexpected events on assembly line re-balancing are always ignored. With the advanced sensor technologies and Internet of Things, the machine degradation process can be monitored continuously, and condition-based maintenance can be implemented to improve the health state of each machine. With the technology of robotic process automation, workflows of the assembly process can be smoothed and workstations can work autonomously together. A higher level of process automation can be achieved. Real-time information of the processing abilities of machines will bring new opportunities for automated workload balance via adaptive decision-making. In this study, a fuzzy control system is developed to make real-time decisions to balance the workloads based on the processing abilities of workstations, given the policy of condition-based maintenance. Fuzzy controllers are used to decide whether to re-balance the assembly line and how to adjust the production rate of each workstation. The numerical experiments show that the buffer level of the assembly line with the proposed fuzzy control system is lower than that of the assembly line without any control system and the buffer level of the assembly line with another control system is the lowest. The demand can always be satisfied by assembly lines except the one with another control system since there is too much production loss sacrificed for the low buffer level. The sensitivity analysis of the control performance to the parameter settings is also conducted. Thus, the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy control system is demonstrated, and intelligent automation can improve the performance of the assembly process by the fuzzy control system since real-time information of the assembly line can be used for adaptive decision-making.",

Publicly available datasets are scarce, making it difficult to establish new approaches and comparative studies. In this work, COLET-COgnitive workLoad estimation based on Eye-Tracking dataset is presented. Methods: Forty-seven (47) individuals’ eye movements were monitored as they solved puzzles involving visual search activities of varying complexity and duration. The participants’ cognitive workload level was evaluated with the subjective test of NASA-TLX and this score is used as an annotation of the activity. Extensive data analysis was performed in order to derive eye and gaze features from low-level eye recorded metrics, and a range of machine learning models were evaluated and tested regarding the estimation of the cognitive workload level. Results: The activities induced four different levels of cognitive workload. Multi tasking and time pressure have induced a higher level of cognitive workload than the one induced by single tasking and absence of time pressure. Multi tasking had a significant effect on 17 eye features while time pressure had a significant effect on 7 eye features. Both binary and multi-class identification attempts were performed by testing a variety of well-known classifiers, resulting in encouraging results towards cognitive workload levels estimation, with up to 88% correct predictions between low and high cognitive workload. Conclusions: Machine learning analysis demonstrated potential in discriminating cognitive workload levels using only eye-tracking characteristics. The proposed dataset includes a much higher sample size and a wider spectrum of eye and gaze metrics than other similar datasets, allowing for the examination of their relations with various cognitive states.",

This paper presents an integrated Augmented Reality (AR) solution developed to assist manual inspection tasks in the supporting areas of semiconductor manufacturing, referred to as the sub-fab. The solution is accessible to a human worker wearing an AR headset during the inspection process at the location. We propose a system framework to deploy computational intelligences of varying granularity provided by the solution across cloud, edge, and device levels, accommodating constraints within the sub-fab. A machine maintenance module helps estimate and monitor the health condition of running scrubbers. Incorrect intentions performed by the worker on the scrubber control panel are detected through hand gesture recognition. This instantly prompts warning messages in the AR headset to prevent subsequent wrong actions. The solution can also identify abnormal device states through 6D pose estimation of objects enabled by machine learning models. A test scenario demonstrates how these functional features enhance the inspection efficiency and quality by reducing human workloads.

Due to increased customer demands, increasing production amounts and intense competition cause severe fluctuations in production environments. This is also evident in assembly lines. Balancing problems caused by many reasons in assembly lines has become a big problem for companies. In this study, the balancing problem in the assembly line in an automotive supplier industry company that produces cables has been tried to be solved. In the solution of the problem, the Rank positional weight method, which is among the heuristics frequently used in the literature, and the Kilbridge and Wester heuristics were used. Considering the current situation, the cycle time from 170 s has been reduced to 142.25 s, and the line efficiency has been increased from 82.36% to 98.42%. There was no increase or decrease in the number of stations on the line and the number of operators working there. As a result of all these efforts, the workload was distributed equally among the stations, severely reducing waiting time. In this way, the downtimes in production were reduced, the overtime hours required to reach the required daily production amount were eliminated, and labor costs were reduced.",3

Making the boundaries of acceptable performance visually perceivable should elicit skill-based behavior, thus lowering the cognitive load. To illustrate the psychological mechanisms of ecological interface design and validate its influence on cognitive load, we compared a conventional speedometer to an ecological speedometer. Both interfaces were displayed on the head-up display of a static driving simulator and were tested in a rural highway scenario. In a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated-measure design, the human–machine interface was tested along with the informative intelligent speed assistance system (representing an existing alternative for speed control) and the additional workload induced by a 1-back task (representing cognitively demanding driving situations). To measure cognitive load, we used a tactile version of the detection response task and controlled for all confounding variables. The experiment was conducted with 28 male and 21 female drivers. Our hypotheses and the ecological interface design theory are supported by the finding that the ecological speedometer reduces the use of cognitive resources. Moreover, the specific application of the ecological speedometer enables better driving performance (i.e., longitudinal and lateral control) compared to a conventional speedometer.",

Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks.",

A mixed reality (MR) integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping framework for immersive and intuitive telemanipulation of a complex mobile manipulator is presented. The proposed 3D immersive telerobotic schemes provide the users with depth perception through the merging of multiple 3D/2D views of the remote environment via MR subspace. The mobile manipulator platform consists of a 6°-of-freedom (DOF) industrial manipulator, 3D-printed parallel gripper, and mobile base, which can be controlled by non-skilled operators who are physically separated from the robot working space through a velocity-based imitative motion mapping approach. This work evaluates the impact of depth perception and immersion provided by integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes on teleoperation efficiency and user experience in an MR environment. In particular, the MR enhanced systems maintain spatial awareness and perceptual salience of the remote scene in 3D, facilitating intuitive mixed reality human-robot interaction (MR-HRI). This study compared two MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes against a typical 2D Baseline visual display method through pick-and-place, assembly, and dexterous manufacturing tasks.

Most industrial accidents occur today due to human error. For safe and efficient operation, it is therefore critical to ensure optimal operator performance. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and concomitant digitalization, the role of operators has become cognitively challenging. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the cognitive performance of operators. One of the major constructs to understand cognitive performance is the cognitive workload. An increase in cognitive workload often leads to degradation in performance. Traditional assessment techniques fail to capture cognitive aspects of performance. Recently, researchers in various domains such as aviation, driving, marine, and nuclear power have started to utilize physiological measures to gauge the cognitive workload of their operators. In our previous works, we have used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking separately to assess the cognitive workload of operators in the process industries. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the benefits of their fusion in classifying process industry control room operators’ workload into low, medium, and high classes while they tackle abnormal situations. The methodology employs the fusion of metrics derived from pupil, gaze, and EEG data to train a decision tree-based model for workload classification. Our results reveal that fusion leads to an increase in classification accuracy of upto 22 %.

The MILP formulations, however, are not usually capable of solving large size problem instances. In this paper, the aim is to solve the WSLBP using mathematical programming formulations by using off-the-shelf solvers. Differently from the literature some non-MILP formulations are also considered for the problem. For this purpose, three MILP formulations, one from the literature, and two non-MILP formulations are compared.

Accelerating the pre-deployment phase to quickly reconfigure workstation design and assess its impact on workload balancing and task sequencing during the deployment of assembly lines still represents a challenging task considering the available software tools. This research proposes a new mathematical model to accelerate the design of ergonomic human-robot collaborative workstations based on task alternatives and the combined consideration of postural assessment and fatigue analyses for each of them to design an ergo-friendly collaborative environment. Surface electromyography analysis is jointly adopted with postural risk assessment measured with inertial measurement units and developed by a digital ergonomic platform to determine the optimal workplace configuration for tools, equipment, and resources to promote physical well-being while considering station productivity. Experimental tests are performed to investigate arm muscles and postural risk assessment for different configurations of workstation design and collaborative human-robot job progression. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, and the advantages of the proposed approach compared to existing simulation software to quickly generate and assess alternative scenarios and find a trade-off between ergo-quality levels and system performance.

New pheromone release strategies, including deposition and evaporation, are employed to update the global pheromone quantity. Additionally, a new best solution update method does not retain the solution with minimum objective function but balances the workload of each operator.

Two different setup scenarios, based on typical hardware setups, are modeled and optimized. The major contribution is an efficient heuristic algorithm to optimize our suggested model, which provides near optimal solutions in fraction of the time required by a general optimization package.

Notably, the application of cognitive load theory holds significant prominence in this field. Efficient evaluation of cognitive load not only facilitates the optimization of resource management and task allocation, but is also the key to creating a fluent interactive experience. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and physiological measurement technologies, new methodologies have emerged to measure and understand cognitive load. This research introduces a system for HCI training and assessment. The system, through the development of digital memory paradigms, induces and verifies varying levels of cognitive load with precision, thereby providing data-driven insights for HCI design. Specifically, this study constructs an AI-assisted multimodal cognitive load assessment framework, integrating physiological data collected from Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye-tracking technologies. By extracting and analyzing 29 physiological features, including channel features, graph-theoretic features, and features pertaining to eyelid and iris movements, we propose an innovative multimodal recognition approach to classify cognitive load across individuals. The experimental results not only verified the validity of the method, but also revealed changes in physiological patterns at different levels of cognitive load. In particular, the significant potential of the fNIRS feature in band I. This discovery suggests that we can monitor and predict cognitive load with greater precision through physiological signals, hence optimizing the design of HCI systems to alleviate user strain, prevent information overload, and enhance the naturalness and intuitiveness of interaction.",

To provide a continuous estimation of the CW, we built a CW recognizer that maps human electroencephalograms (EEGs) to discrete CW levels with deep learning tools. However, the EEG distribution varies when humans perform different cognitive tasks. There is thus a question on the capacity for generalizing the CW recognizer across tasks. In this study, we examined the CW's performance when it was trained and tested on two EEG databases corresponding to different human-machine tasks. Methods A novel deep neural network-based EEG recognizer, dynamic residual network with attention mechanism (DRNA-Net), is proposed in the present study. By taking advantage of recurrent networks, the DRNA-Net further incorporates a self-attention mechanism in discovering robust EEG patterns across different cognitive tasks. Results We designed an experiment that applied a multidimensional N-back task to induce the CW that consists of visual and auditory memory tasks. We validated the cross-task generalization capability of the DRNA-Net based on the EEG features extracted from the N-back task and a public database.

Balancing the PCB assembly line is crucial for improving productivity to meet market demand, which means balancing the workload distributed among various assembly stations on the assembly line. However, the workload balancing depends on material-handling systems in production environments that facilitate the transportation of raw materials to the buffer storage of the assembly stations. In the PCB assembly system, the material handling is carried out using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This paper studies the assembly line balancing and AGV scheduling collectively because of their dependency on each other. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to balance the workload distribution among stations and schedule the AGVs. An existing intelligent platform of the real-life PCB industry is considered to solve this integrated problem with intelligent decisions. The platform includes three layers modules: physical layer, data management layer and application service layer. A novel genetic artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is proposed and embedded with an application service layer to optimize the current problem and give optimum solutions for the real-life physical layer. The proposed GABC algorithm incorporates the operators of the genetic algorithm (GA) i.e., crossover and mutation into the search process of the ABC algorithm. Additionally, the greedy selection feature is employed in GABC which significantly enhances the exploitation capabilities, leading to faster convergence, higher-quality solutions, and improved robustness. The performance of the proposed GABC algorithm is tested based on different parameters by comparing the results with GA, ABC and PSO algorithms. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed GABC algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms. Therefore, the yielded solutions in terms of prompt responses help managers to expedite the production through intelligent decision-making based on customer demands.",

Studies indicate that sub-optimal decisions occur when there is a mismatch between the demands of the process and the human's capability. This mismatch leads to high cognitive workload in human operators, often a precursor for poor performance. Recently, researchers in various safety critical domains (aviation, driving, marine, NPP, etc.) have started to explore the use of physiological measurements from humans to understand their cognitive workload and its effect. In this work, we evaluate the potential of EEG to measure cognitive workload of human operators in chemical process control room. We propose a single dry electrode EEG based methodology for identifying the similarities and mismatch between the operators’ mental model of the process and the actual process behaviour during abnormal situations. Our results reveal that SƟ(ω), the power spectral density of theta (ɵ) waves (frequency range 4–7 Hz) in the EEG signal has the potential to identify such mismatches. Results indicate that SƟ(ω) is positively correlated with workload and hence can be used for assessing the cognitive workload of operators in process industries.",

In an assembly line balancing problem, there is a massive amount of research in the literature assuming deterministic environment, and many other works consider uncertain task times. This research utilises the uncertainty theory to model uncertain demand and introduces complexity theory to measure the uncertainty of assembly lines. Scenario probability and triangular fuzzy number are used to describe the uncertain demand. The station complexity was measured based on information entropy and fuzzy entropy to assist in balancing systems with robust performances, considering the influence of multi-model products in the station on the assembly line. Taking minimum station complexity, minimum workload difference within station, maximum productivity as objective functions, a new optimization model for mixed-model assembly line balancing under uncertain demand was established. Then an improved genetic algorithm was applied to solve the model. Finally, the effectiveness of the model was verified by several instances of mixed-model assembly line for automobile engine.",

A reliable measurement of cognitive workload could allow for improvements in human machine interface designs and increase safety in several domains. At present, numerous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive workload, reporting the rise in cognitive workload to be associated with increases in theta band power and decreases in alpha band power. However, results have been inconsistent with some failing to reach the required level of significance. We hypothesized that the lack of consistency could be related to individual differences in task performance and/or to the small sample sizes in most EEG studies. In the present study we used EEG to assess the increase in cognitive workload occurring in a multitasking environment while taking into account differences in performance. Twenty participants completed a task commonly used in airline pilot recruitment, which included an increasing number of concurrent sub-tasks to be processed from one to four. Subjective ratings, performances scores, pupil size and EEG signals were recorded. Results showed that increases in EEG alpha and theta band power reflected increases in the involvement of cognitive resources for the completion of one to three subtasks in a multitasking environment. These values reached a ceiling when performances dropped. Consistent differences in levels of alpha and theta band power were associated to levels of task performance: highest performance was related to lowest band power.",

Vestel Electronics is a leading producer of washing machines and holds a noteworthy market position in the European consumer electronics industry.

The decision maker must consider several important factors while forming the production schedule, including job-assembly line compatibility, the release times and due dates of the jobs, and a workload balance among the different assembly lines. This study aims to develop an algorithm to minimize the total earliness and tardiness while considering sequence-and-machine-dependent setups, unequal release times, machine-job compatibility restrictions, and workload balance requirements. To address this complex scheduling problem, we propose a novel algorithm, the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), which has a strong exploration–exploitation balance while mimicking real-world dynamics.

This paper introduces a semantic model for workload categorization. The model takes as input, a set of multi-modal physiological measurements, and uses parallel processing, complex event processing, and rule-based modelling to categorize a series of workloads (resting, cognitive workload, and physical workload). The model has undergone a set of evaluations, including categorization accuracy, and performance.

At the same time as the technology is introduced, errors in manufacturing are a problem which is affecting the productivity and the quality. This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation- reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems. Furthermore, the empirical findings showed that for managing human errors, the main bottleneck of an AR system is the systems artificial intelligence capabilities.",

Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load.",

In asynchronous lines blocking and starvation phenomena are responsible of performances deterioration. Three popular techniques able to limit these phenomena are: balancing the workload among stations by tasks assignment, allocating buffers between stations, optimizing of the sequence of models entering the line. These three techniques correspond to the Mixed-model Assembly Line Balancing Problem (MALBP), the buffer allocation problem (BAP) and the sequencing problem (SP). The presented approach is able to simultaneously solve these three problems, which are strictly connected, and is based on a Genetic Algorithm procedure that uses discrete event simulation to evaluate the fitness function of individuals.

Recent studies have proved that the maintenance area is experiencing many innovations in terms of approaches and technologies. In this field, the rapid progress of technological equipment is leading to an increase in the human operators’ mental workload. This paper presents preliminary concepts and objectives of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Maintenance Operations. The DSS intends to assist industrial professionals and stakeholders in maintenance tasks characterised by significant cognitive demands. Considering variables such as task complexity and the mental and physical condition of operators involved in a maintenance task, the DSS will provide real-time recommendations for selecting the most suitable operators by promoting a gradual technology introduction, increasing industrial performance, and ensuring the well-being of the workers.",8

Following Cognitive Load Theory and Attention Theory, AR assistance can reduce the burden on workers’ mental capacity while performing a task, thereby improving task performance. The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors.",

The task difficulty was induced by auditory noise, arithmetical count and working memory load. We estimated cognitive workload using EOG and EEG-based mental state monitoring. One novelty consists in recording the EOG around the ears (alternative EOG) and around the eyes (conventional EOG). The number of blinks and saccades amplitude increased along with the difficulty increase (p ≤ 0.05). We found significant correlations between EOG and EEG (theta/alpha ratio) and between conventional and alternative EOG signal.

A comprehensive dataset was meticulously compiled, including physiological, behavioral, and subjective data to ensure robust analyses. The EEG data underwent rigorous pre-processing and feature extraction processes, focusing on brain connectivity metrics such as Coherence and Phase-Locking Value across multiple frequency bands and employing three neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks (ConvLSTM) for classification.

This work aims to investigate whether the combination of the box task and the detection response task (DRT) is a suitable method for assessing the cognitive distraction caused by speech-based assistants. For this purpose, participants (N = 39) engaged in artificial (n-back tasks) and natural speech-based secondary tasks (interaction with Android’s Google Assistant and Apple's Siri) differing in predefined levels of cognitive workload while performing the box task and the DRT. The results showed that DRT performance differed between the 0-back and 1-back task but not between the different cognitive workload levels of the speech-based assistants.

To determine favorable design and manufacturing solutions, designers must navigate this 3D spatial complexity while ensuring the functionality and manufacturability of their designs. Evaluating the manufacturability of their solutions necessitates modalities that help naturally visualize AM processes and the designs enabled by them. Digitally non-immersive visualization can reduce this expense, but digital immersion has the potential to further improve the experience before building. This research investigates how differences in immersion between computer-aided (CAx) and virtual reality (VR) environments affect a designer’s approach to solving a build-with-AM (BAM) problem and its outcomes. First, it studies how immersion affects determining favorable build orientations when considering the additive manufacturability outcomes of designs of varying complexity. Second, it studies how immersion affects the participants’ experiential outcomes, including evaluation time, attempts made, and cognitive load when solving the BAM problem. Analysis reveals that as design complexity increases, visualizing and manufacturing designs in VR improves additive manufacturability outcomes by reducing build time and support material usage compared to CAx, reducing manufacturing costs by up to 4.61 % ($32) per part. Using immersive VR also helps designers determine favorable build orientations faster with fewer attempts and without increasing the cognitive load experienced. These findings present important implications for the role of immersive experiences in preparing designers to quickly produce lower-cost and sustainable manufacturing solutions with AM.",

Parallel two-sided assembly lines, rather a new research area, allocate more flexible workers and reduce throughput time by incorporating the advantages of two-sided and parallel assembly lines. Since parallel two-sided assembly lines are utilized to produce large-scale products, such as automobiles, trucks, and buses in industry; they also require a significant worker movement between parallel lines because of the unavoidable walking distances between lines.

Elevated cognitive load has been shown to deplete working memory, potentially impeding task performance and situational awareness. Despite the susceptibility of exoskeleton users to increased cognitive load, there has been limited empirical evaluation of this risk while performing construction tasks. This study evaluates the cognitive load associated with using an active back-support exoskeleton while performing construction tasks. An experiment was conducted to capture brain activity using an Electroencephalogram, both with and without the use of an active back-support exoskeleton. A construction framing task involving six subtasks was considered as a case study. The participants’ cognitive load was assessed for the tested conditions and subtasks through the alpha band of the Electroencephalogram signals. The study identified the most sensitive Electroencephalogram channels for evaluating cognitive load when using exoskeletons. Statistical tests, including a one-way repeated measure ANOVA, paired t-test, and Spearman Rank were conducted to make inferences about the collected data. The results revealed that using an active back-support exoskeleton while performing the carpentry framing task increased the cognitive load of the participants, as indicated by four out of five significant Electroencephalogram channels. Selected channels in the frontal and occipital lobes emerged as the most influential channels in assessing cognitive load. Additionally, the study explores the relationships among Electroencephalogram channels, revealing strong correlations between selected channels in the frontal lobe and between channels in the occipital and frontal lobes. These findings enhance understanding of how specific brain regions respond to the use of active back support exoskeletons during construction tasks. By identifying which brain regions are most affected, this study contributes to optimizing exoskeleton designs to better manage cognitive load, potentially improving both the ergonomic effectiveness and safety of these devices in construction environments.",

The results show that simultaneous input–output control is effective and enables the systems to maintain WIP balance, absorb demand fluctuations, and effectively reject disturbances. The simulations of the complex system showed that it might be advantageous to provide more local or more global information to the controllers, depending on the variability of the processing times and on the managerial focus. Closed-loop discrete-event models for WLC production control are unprecedented. Also, a simultaneous input and output control setting is much less reported in WLC literature than settings with input control only (i.e., order release only). This paper contributes in both ways.",

As a result, new AI-driven support systems that leverage the power of computer vision algorithms have been deployed to facilitate the operators' work. However, to effectively design intuitive, AI-driven interfaces and validate their impact on the operators' performance, extensive user testing is required. To address this, we previously developed and tested a virtual reality (VR) control room that can be used to iteratively evaluate intelligent computer assistants and interfaces while operators are subjected to different cognitive load. In the present study, we use this VR environment and physiological markers (e.g., eye tracking measures) to investigate how AI-based visual cueing (i.e., pushing forward video streams on which detections are highlighted by rectangles drawn around targets) affects operator performance and cognitive load. Results suggest that support systems using such technology in a control room improve operators’ performance and decrease their cognitive load, as reflected by changes in pupil dilation and subjective reports irrespective of induced cognitive load.",

The makespan, transport time, imbalance degree of team workload, and imbalance degree of cycle time are taken as optimization objectives. First, a mathematical model considering transport time and worker competencies is developed, and then a mixed encoding and decoding method is proposed. Second, an algorithm that hybridizes the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm is proposed, involving an improved Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic method and a strengthened elite retention strategy to improve the quality of the solution.

Nowadays, population aging is acknowledged as a global trend. Among individual factors impacting on workers’ performance, high attention is being paid to the age from scientific community, policy-makers and business leaders. In this paper, demographic aspects and their implications on workforce composition are illustrated; successively, main findings on age-related performance characteristics are summarized. The authors propose an age- related model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is an integer programming model allowing for the maximization of the overall system performance jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits.

Understanding the circumstances in which cognitive load occurs and reliably predicting such occurrences, offers the potential for considerable advances in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Numerous HCI applications, ranging from medical and health-related solutions to (smart) automotive environments, would directly benefit from the reliable detection of cognitive load. However, this task still remains highly challenging. We present a machine learning (ML) approach based on ensemble learning for robust cognitive load classification. The features used by the proposed solution are generated from the interpretation of physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate, r-r interval, skin temperature, and skin response) from a wearable device. Hence, our approach consists of two steps: (1) transforming the original data into discriminative features and (2) training an ensemble model to accurately and robustly predict cognitive load. The empirical results confirm that our method has a superior performance compared to various state-of-the-art baselines on the original and transformed data.

These assessment schemes, however, ignore the cognitive aspects of learning, such as mental model development and cognitive workload. The HMM-based model proposed in Part 1 offers a systematic way to quantify operators' cognition during abnormalities. In this Part 2, we show that the cognitive behaviors displayed by expert operators can be represented as target values on the HMM's state transitions and emission probability distributions. Further, we propose two axioms of learning that can capture the evolution of the operator's mental models as they learn the causal relationships in the process and gain expertise in handling abnormal situations. We validate the proposed axioms by conducting training experiments involving 10 participants performing 486 tasks.

These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors.

The goal is to determine the minimum workforce required to process split lots at sub-assembly stations to feed the paced line over a periodic time window. Limited by a given buffer capacity at each station but with flexible start times for each split lot, an efficient workforce scheduling is possible to prevent shortages in downstream stations. Therefore, a stock-continuity equation has been proposed yielding the size of those split lots. Next, a single-objective Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model is formulated for the problem as a combination of two implicitly weighted goals to minimise the workforce and the unbalanced workloads.

The correlation coefficient between noise exposure level and mood state based on workload levels ranged from 0.3 at medium workload to 0.57 at very high workload.

However, traditional programming methods lack intuitive interaction and rely heavily on simulation environments or pre-set CAD models, leading to high costs for both initial setup and sim-to-real deployment.

To address these limitations, this study introduces a four-layer system architecture that integrates AR-assisted DT into skill-based robotic assembly scenarios. Additionally, a skill-based and low-code programming system for human-guided robotic assembly is designed and implemented, which incorporates natural human guidance and robot autonomous intelligence to generate adaptive and feasible action plans. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are verified by two case studies and a quantitative experiment comparing to traditional programming methods.

This work aims to provide an approach for an optimal allocation of disassembly tasks to individual employees and therefore enable a basis for planning and control in disassembly. At first, a task description is provided based on which a standardized time for operations is considered. Second, a link is created between the task description and the product state. Depending on the product state the time determined prior can be adjusted. Third, human skills are considered in manufacturing. It is assumed that within a production system there are different employees with different, developing skill sets. Based on specific skills, a task-to-person-is conducted. Using the information gathered, a Digital Twin (DT) that includes the human nature of the employees and their state is created to enable a simulation of tasks and thereby also a learning system for “first-time-seen” products. When facing complex tasks, the cognitive load and human's fatigue are decisive for performance and thereby the time required for execution. Completing these steps, a multistage concept is created that enables a more precise disassembly planning that can be shown in the case study on the example of components of electric vehicles.",

Currently, most feature extraction techniques mainly focus on time domain or linear techniques but rarely consider the non-stationary nature, individual differences, and recording noise. This study has proposed a new time–frequency feature extraction method based on Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform providing an effective quantification of oscillatory behavior of a single transient. The extracted features have been classified using a recurrent neural network with the advantage of dynamic mapping procedure. The proposed method has been evaluated using EDA data acquired during an arithmetic task of five workload levels with both subtle and distinct differences. In a comparative study, the effects of several decomposition parameters and cognitive factors have been explored. Experimental results have shown that it achieves an average accuracy rate of 98.52% for three workload levels discrimination by optimizing the number of features to 3 (features extracted from a low frequency sub-band) from 15 (features extracted from five frequency sub-bands), i.e., 80% feature reduction. The greatest contribution coming fromthe smallest frequency sub-bands has also been obtained. This method is superior to other existing methods in separating 3 to 5 workload levels with both distinct and subtle differences extracting effective oscillatory characteristics. Considering the merits of a simple feature extraction procedure and cost-effectiveness of a single lead EDA signal as well as high discriminability between several workload levels, it provides a trade-off between performance and computational complexity, thus demonstrating its potential for online human-error prevention systems.",

Nonetheless, the shared situational awareness between the flight crews under adverse weather conditions might be impaired. This research aims to evaluate the impact of a proposed enhancement in communication protocol on cognitive workload and develop a human-centred classification model to identify hazardous meteorological conditions. Thirty groups of subjects completed four post-landing taxiing tasks under two visibility conditions (CAVOK/CAT IIIA) while two different communication protocols (presence/absence of turning direction information) were adopted by the air traffic control officer (ATCOs). Electroencephalography (EEG) and the NASA Task Load Index were respectively used to reflect the pilot’s mental state and to evaluate the pilot’s mental workload subjectively. Results indicated that impaired visibility increases the subjective workload significantly, while the inclusion of turning direction information in the ATCO’s instruction would not significantly intensify their cognitive workload. Mutual information was used to quantitatively assess the shared situational awareness between the pilot flying and the pilot monitoring. Finally, this research proposes a human-centred approach to identify potentially hazardous weather conditions from EEG power spectral densities with Bayesian neural networks (BNN). The classification model has outperformed other baseline algorithms with an accuracy of 66.5%, an F1 score of 61.4%, and an area under the ROC of 0.749. Using the concept of explainable AI with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values, the exploration of latent mental patterns formulates novel knowledge to gain insights into the vital physiological indicators of the pilots in response to different scenarios from the BNN model. In the long term, the model facilitates the decision regarding the necessity of providing automation and decision-making aids to pilots.",

Virtual reality (VR) – one of the promising technologies at the base of Industry 4.0 – is able to address the design issues of CMSs, and even decrease costs and time when employed from the initial conception to the final validation of production lines, since it facilitates their virtual commissioning, i.e., it enables the full verification of systems and related components by virtual inspection and tests. Despite the above advantages, VR is still rarely used in the design of CMSs, and there is no standard VR approach in industry yet. In addition, the related scientific literature is scarce and often limited to small or simplified cases. To fill this gap, this work presents a novel VR-based approach for designing CMSs, composed of four phases: Three-dimensional CAD Export, Model Import, Scene Creation, and VR Review. The proposed approach is applied to a real industrial use case related to the virtual commissioning of an electric axles production line and it is evaluated through a questionnaire from industry professionals. The case study shows that using the VR technology enhanced the technical communication between experts in the teamwork, and it was particularly effective in finding ergonomics flaws like issues in visibility, reach, and posture using a virtual golden zone. In addition, all users found the VR interaction enjoyable and easy to learn, and beginner users perceived a comparable workload as advanced users.",

Traditional design approaches are based on the observation of individual workers performing their jobs, the detection of unnatural postures (e.g., bending, twisting, overextending, rotating), and the definition of late corrective actions according to ergonomic guidelines. Recently, computer-integrated simulations based on virtual prototypes and digital human models (DHMs) can be used to assess manufacturing ergonomics on virtual manikins operating in digital workplaces. Such simulations allow validating different design alternatives and optimizing the workstation design before the creation, and pave the way to a new approach to manufacturing system design. The present paper aims at comparing different computer-integrated set-ups to support the design of human-centred manufacturing workstations. It defines a protocol analysis to support workstation design by analysing both physical and cognitive aspects, and applies the protocol within different digital set-ups. In particular, the study investigates a 2D desktop set-up using standardized DHMs and a 3D immersive mixed reality set-up based on motion capture of real workers’ acting into a mixed environment, comparing them with the traditional approach. An industrial case study focusing on design optimization of a manufacturing workstation in the energy industry is used to test the effectiveness of the two digital set-ups for the definition of re-design actions.",

(1) Information can be divided into biologically primary information that we have evolved to process and acquire unconsciously, and secondary information that requires conscious effort. (2) Secondary information is either acquired during problem solving or from other people. It is processed by a limited capacity, limited duration working memory before being stored for subsequent use in long-term memory. Once stored, information may be transferred back to working memory to govern action relevant to the extant environment. Working memory has no known capacity or duration limits when dealing with information transferred back from long-term memory.

(4) That differential knowledge results in individual differences in expertise and provides a major source, possibly the only source, of modifiable cognitive differences between learners.

However, it is unclear how these potential benefits of augmentation affect drivers’ distraction from the driving task and their level of workload. Since gaze detection cannot separate glances at AR-elements from glances at the driving scene, new evaluation criteria are needed for measuring the distraction potential of AR-elements. The paper evaluates a methodology based on the Detection Response Task (DRT) for measuring the distraction and workload effects of three different display technologies: Head-Down Display (HDD), Head-Up Display (HUD), and Augmented-Reality HUD (AR-HUD). The DRT measures cognitive and visual workload based on a recognition-response task using the two parameters, reaction time and misses. Two experimental studies using driving simulation (N = 24) and production vehicles in real traffic (N = 24) are reported. As use cases, the subjects had to navigate through an urban traffic environment and pass different intersections. During that they were assisted by navigation systems based on the above mentioned display technologies. The resulting workload is compared to a baseline drive without the need to navigate and a reference drive in which the subjects had to work on a secondary task while driving. The results of the DRT are compared with subjective measures, gaze behaviour, and driving performance. In addition, drivers’ preference and user experience regarding the three display technologies and their feedback concerning the DRT method were assessed. The results of both experimental studies show that drivers prefer the AR-HUD display technology. Reasons are mainly the hedonic aspects of the AR-HUD such as the novelty of the technology. Nevertheless, drivers report that AR-elements could obstruct important areas of the road and distract more from the driving task than HUDs. The subjective and visual-cognitive workload measured by the DRT do not differ between the HMI conditions. An analysis for each type of intersection yields most misses for the AR-HUD condition and fewest misses in the HDD condition. However, visual workload (i.e. eyes-off-road time) is higher for HDD compared to (AR-)HUD. Feedback by participants reveals that the DRT as a method for workload assessment is well accepted. All in all, the two DRT measures, misses and reaction time, allow a valid and objective workload measurement and could serve as a supplement or substitute for gaze analysis. The discussion gives indications for the measurement of workload effects caused by AR-HUD using DRT.",

Several elements of real-life situations that impact human performance, such as stressors, are difficult or impossible to replicate in the laboratory. Expeditions offer unique possibilities for studying human cognition in complex environments that can transfer to other situations with similar features. For example, as caves share several of the physical and psychological challenges of safety-critical environments such as spaceflight, underground expeditions have been developed as an analogue for astronaut training purposes, suggesting that they might also be suitable for studying aspects of behaviour and cognition that cannot be fully examined under laboratory conditions. While a large range of topics and tools have been proposed for application in such environments, few have been used in the field. Methods and procedures for maximizing the robustness and scientific value of expedition research designs must first be developed and validated. We tested the feasibility of collecting human physiological, cognitive, and subjective experience data concerning brain state, sleep, cognitive workload, and fatigue, during a speleological expedition in a remote region. We document our approaches and challenges experienced, and provide recommendations and suggestions to aid future work. The data support the idea that cave expeditions are relevant naturalistic paradigms that offer unique possibilities for cognitive neuroscience to complement laboratory work and help improve human performance and safety in operational environments.",

Subjects (N = 33) compared the two input methods available on a consumer grade VR headset for their effects on objective user performance and subjective experience of the perceived sense of presence, cognitive workload, and ease-of-use. We found that virtual hands (with hand-tracking) did not influence the subjective feelings of perceived presence, naturalness, & engagement; neither did it inspire the overall ease-of-use while performing the task. In fact, subjects completed the task faster and felt a lower mental workload and higher overall usability with handheld-controllers. The result found that in this particular case, hand-tracking did not improve the psychological and emotional determinants of immersive VR experiences.

However, the accident rate hasn’t dropped significantly with the advanced technology onboard. The main cause of this phenomenon is human errors which drive researchers to study human factors in the maritime domain. One of the key factors that contribute to human performance is their mental states such as cognitive workload and stress. In this paper, we propose and implement an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based psychophysiological evaluation system to be used in maritime virtual simulators for monitoring, training and assessing the seafarers. The system includes an EEG processing part, visualization part, and an evaluation part. By using the processing part of the system, different brain states including cognitive workload and stress can be identified from the raw EEG data recorded during maritime exercises in the simulator. By using the visualization part, the identified brain states, raw EEG signals, and videos recorded during the maritime exercises can be synchronized and displayed together. By using the evaluation part of the system, an indicative recommendation on “pass”, “retrain”, or “fail” of the seafarers’ performance can be obtained based on the EEG-based cognitive workload and stress recognition. Detailed analysis of the demanding events in the maritime tasks is provided by the system for each seafarer that could be used to improve their training. A case study is presented using the proposed system. EEG data from 4 pilots were recorded when they were performing maritime tasks in the simulator. The data are processed and evaluated. The results show that one pilot gets a “pass” recommendation, one pilot gets a “retrain” recommendation, and the other two get “fail” results regarding their performance in the simulator.",

Forty-four participants were equally divided into AR and ordinary training groups with the equivalent instructional materials, which included text information and 3D models. Results show that although AR did not significantly affect the overall workload and system usability assessment (SUS) recorded, several experimental values increased significantly compared with the ordinary training method, including task completion time, time required to interpret text-based information, amount of attention switching, and training effectiveness. Consequently, the use of AR did not result in a completion time and workload reduction; however, we found that training with the AR system was more effective than ordinary training in increasing the knowledge retention of participants without increasing their overall workload, especially for the month-term memory. Nonetheless, a longer time was required by the users to familiarize themselves with the AR environment and read the text information. The findings of this work could contribute to the design of future AR training systems in industry considering natural human behavior and enhance training effectiveness.",

Twenty-four males and females, randomly divided into control and exoskeleton groups, performed an overhead reaching and pointing task over three days without (single task) and with (dual task) a working memory task. Task performance, electromyography (EMG), neural activity, heart rate, and subjective responses were collected. While task completion time reduced for both groups at the same rate over days, EMG activity of shoulder muscles was lower for the exoskeleton group for both tasks, specifically for females during the dual task. Dual task reduced the physiological benefits of exoskeletons and neuromotor strategies to adapt to the dual task demands differed between the groups. Neuromuscular benefits of exoskeleton use were immediately realized irrespective of cognitive demand, however the perceptual, physiological, and neural adaptations with exoskeleton use were task- and sex-specific.",

This paper proposed a dynamic risk assessment model based on System Dynamics and SPAR-H. The cognitive load was introduced into the Performance Shaping Factor (PSF) network to make it more suitable for the task and environment of manned deep submergence. In addition, in order to measure the compensation effect of PSF on the work efficiency of oceanauts, eight compensation functions were constructed between PSFs and work efficiency. Finally, key risk tasks and sensitive PSFs were identified. Taking the 12 h manned deep diving mission as an example, the dynamic quantification of human error probability and work efficiency of oceanauts was simulated.

This paper introduces the CT benchmark, a benchmark and model set designed to facilitate the testing and evaluation of human-robot collaborative assembly scenarios. It was designed to compare manual and automatic processes using metrics such as the assembly time and human workload. The components of the model set can be assembled through the most common assembly tasks, each with varying levels of difficulty. The CT benchmark was designed with a focus on its applicability in human-robot collaborative environments, with the aim of ensuring the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Experiments were carried out to assess assembly performance in three different setups (manual, automatic and collaborative), measuring metrics related to the assembly time and the workload on human operators. The results suggest that the collaborative approach takes longer than the fully manual assembly, with an increase of 70.8%.

The work is part of large ongoing projects with this industry, and the main purposes are minimising the number of required workstations and smoothing the operators’ workload. The company has invested in new flexible automated assembly systems, which accommodate dozens of workstations and many moving boxes. Footwear components are inside boxes (with various quantities) which can move from the warehouses to a convenient workstation or between any workstations (in any order). This is a significant and distinct feature of the MALBP, together with the fact that the assignment of different skilled operators and machines is achieved simultaneously. An optimisation model is developed, in part to facilitate the understanding of the situation and to solve small-size instances. Due to the complexity of the problems, we had to devise an approximate method, based on the Variable Neighbourhood Descent (VND) metaheuristic and integrating an adaptation of the Ranked Positional Weighted (RPW) method. The adapted RPW method is used to create initial feasible solutions, while preassigning special operators and machines. After choosing good initial solutions, VND is applied to improve their quality. The new contributed method, named as RPW-VNDbal, is tested with medium and large instances, in two distinct stitching systems. A Lower Bound of the objective function and Simulation contribute to evaluate the solutions and their practicability. The results implemented by the project team, show that the RPW-VNDbal method is fast enough and offers better solutions than those implemented by the experienced operation managers of the company.",

Production at the supplier is done via a mixed-model assembly line. The time between knowing the OEM sequence and delivering the finished workpieces to the OEM is small. Nonetheless, resequencing for the mixed-model assembly line at the supplier might be advantageous under various objectives such as workload balancing, leveling of materials consumption or color batching. However, if resequencing is done, the effort to restore the original OEM sequence should be small to achieve this in time. We propose a model for optimizing resequencing under the condition that restoring the original sequence is achieved via a first-in-first-out (FIFO) strategy, where workpieces are stored in mix banks at the end of production and only the workpieces at the front of those banks have to be dispatched in order to rebuild the original sequence. The model is the combination of an assignment or traveling salesman and a vehicle routing problem. We adapt the load balancing, material leveling, and color batching problem from the sequencing literature to our formulation and present numerical results derived from a controlled testbed. They show that, compared to producing the OEM sequence as-is, huge savings in the objective values ( > 50% on average), are made.

Two-sided assembly lines are utilized to assemble large-sized products (e.g., cars, buses, trucks). Locating two lines in parallel helps improve line efficiency by enabling collaboration between the line workers. This paper proposes a mixed-model parallel two-sided assembly line system that can be utilized to produce large-sized items in an inter-mixed sequence. The mixed-model parallel two-sided line balancing problem is defined and the advantages of utilizing multi-line stations across the lines are discussed. A flexible agent-based ant colony optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problem and a numerical example is given to explain the method systematically. The proposed algorithm builds flexible balancing solutions suitable for any model sequence launched. The dynamically changing workloads of workstations (based on specific product models during the production process) are also explored. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted and the results are statistically analyzed using the well-known paired sample t-test.

The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements.

At the current stage of research, advances in solving realistic and complex assembly line balancing problem, as the one analyzed, are often limited by the poor capability to effectively evaluate the line throughput. Although algorithms are potentially able to consider many features of realistic problems and to effectively explore the solution space, a lack of precision in their objective function evaluation (which usually includes a performance parameter, as the throughput) limits in fact their capability to find good solutions. Traditionally, algorithms use indirect measures of throughput (such as workload smoothness), that are easy to calculate, but whose correlation with the throughput is often poor, especially when the complexity of the problem increases. Algorithms are thus substantially driven towards wrong objectives. The aim of this paper is to show how a decisive step forward can be done in this filed by coupling the most recent advances of simulation techniques with a genetic algorithm approach. A parametric simulator, developed under the event/object oriented paradigm, has been embedded in a genetic algorithm for the evaluation of the objective function, which contains the simulated throughput. The results of an ample simulation study, in which the proposed approach has been compared with other two traditional approaches from the literature, demonstrate that significant improvements are obtainable.",

Whilst the ECG is an important clinical tool, it is frequently incorrectly interpreted. Even expert clinicians are known to impulsively provide a diagnosis based on their first impression and often miss co-abnormalities. Given it is widely reported that there is a lack of competency in ECG interpretation, it is imperative to optimise the interpretation process. Predominantly the ECG interpretation process remains a paper based approach and whilst computer algorithms are used to assist interpreters by providing printed computerised diagnoses, there are a lack of interactive human-computer interfaces to guide and assist the interpreter. Methods An interactive computing system was developed to guide the decision making process of a clinician when interpreting the ECG. The system decomposes the interpretation process into a series of interactive sub-tasks and encourages the clinician to systematically interpret the ECG. We have named this model ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI) as the user cannot ‘progress’ unless they complete each sub-task. Using this model, the ECG is segmented into five parts and presented over five user interfaces (1: Rhythm interpretation, 2: Interpretation of the P-wave morphology, 3: Limb lead interpretation, 4: QRS morphology interpretation with chest lead and rhythm strip presentation and 5: Final review of 12-lead ECG). The IPI model was implemented using emerging web technologies (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, PHP and MySQL). It was hypothesised that this system would reduce the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpreters. To test this, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians when they used the standard approach (control cohort) with clinicians who interpreted the same ECGs using the IPI approach (IPI cohort). Results For the control cohort, the (mean; standard deviation; confidence interval) of the ECG interpretation accuracy was (45.45%; SD=18.1%; CI=42.07, 48.83). The mean ECG interpretation accuracy rate for the IPI cohort was 58.85% (SD=42.4%; CI=49.12, 68.58), which indicates a positive mean difference of 13.4%. (CI=4.45, 22.35) An N−1 Chi-square test of independence indicated a 92% chance that the IPI cohort will have a higher accuracy rate. Interpreter self-rated confidence also increased between cohorts from a mean of 4.9/10 in the control cohort to 6.8/10 in the IPI cohort (p=0.06). Whilst the IPI cohort had greater diagnostic accuracy, the duration of ECG interpretation was six times longer when compared to the control cohort. Conclusions We have developed a system that segments and presents the ECG across five graphical user interfaces. Results indicate that this approach improves diagnostic accuracy but with the expense of time, which is a valuable resource in medical practice.",

The workload and the acceptability of the cobotic collaboration were measured. Working with a cobot decreases the effect of the task complexity on the human workload and on the output quality. However, it increases the time completion and the number of gestures (while decreasing their frequency). The H/C couples have a higher chance of success but they take more time and more gestures to realize the task. The results of this research could help developers and stakeholders to understand the impacts of implementing a cobot in production chains.",

It is particularly true in complex working environments (e.g. flight deck, air traffic control tower), where individuals have sometimes to cope with a high mental workload and stressful situations. Several models (i.e. processing efficiency theory, cognitive-energetical framework) have attempted to provide a conceptual basis on how human performance is modulated by high workload and stress/anxiety. These models predict that stress can reduce human cognitive efficiency, even in the absence of a visible impact on the task performance. Performance may be protected under stress thanks to compensatory effort, but only at the expense of a cognitive cost. Yet, the psychophysiological cost of this regulation remains unclear. We designed two experiments involving pupil diameter, cardiovascular and prefrontal oxygenation measurements. Participants performed the Toulouse N-back Task that intensively engaged both working memory and mental calculation processes under the threat (or not) of unpredictable aversive sounds. The results revealed that higher task difficulty (higher n level) degraded the performance and induced an increased tonic pupil diameter, heart rate and activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, and a decreased phasic pupil response and heart rate variability. Importantly, the condition of stress did not impact the performance, but at the expense of a psychophysiological cost as demonstrated by lower phasic pupil response, and greater heart rate and prefrontal activity. Prefrontal cortex seems to be a central region for mitigating the influence of stress because it subserves crucial functions (e.g. inhibition, working memory) that can promote the engagement of coping strategies. Overall, findings confirmed the psychophysiological cost of both mental effort and stress. Stress likely triggered increased motivation and the recruitment of additional cognitive resources that minimize its aversive effects on task performance (effectiveness), but these compensatory efforts consumed resources that caused a loss of cognitive efficiency (ratio between performance effectiveness and mental effort).",

The increasing utilization of industrial robots at manufacturing sites has been instrumental in reducing human workload. Nevertheless, achieving effective human–robot collaboration/cooperation (HRC) remains a challenge, especially when human workers and robots share a workspace for collaborative tasks. For instance, when an industrial robot encounters a failure, such as dropping an assembling part, it triggers the suspension of the corresponding factory cell for safe recovery. Given the limited capacity of pre-programmed robots to rectify such failures, human intervention becomes imperative, requiring entry into the robot workspace to address the dropped object while the robot system is halted. This discontinuous manufacturing process results in productivity loss. Robotic teleoperation has emerged as a promising technology enabling human workers to undertake high-risk tasks remotely and safely. Our study advocates for the incorporation of robotic teleoperation in the recovery process during manufacturing failure scenarios, which is referred to as “Cooperative Tele-Recovery”. Our proposed approach involves formulating priority rules designed to facilitate collision avoidance between manufacturing and recovery robots. This, in turn, ensures a continuous manufacturing process with minimal production loss within a configurable risk limitation. We present a comprehensive motion priority optimization framework composed of an HRC simulator and a cooperative multi-robot controller to identify optimal parameters for the priority function. The framework dynamically adjusts the allocation of motion priorities for manufacturing and recovery robots while adhering to predefined risk limitations. Through quantitative and qualitative assessments, we validate the novelty of our concept and demonstrate its feasibility.",

However, NIR is biologically active and is commonly applied in targeted photobiomodulation treatments for a range of cognitive, emotional, and physical conditions. Given the removal of NIR from indoor illumination, it is critical to understand how ambient NIR may influence psychological and physical health, and whether reduced exposure to NIR in indoor environments could be cause for concern. In a preregistered within-subjects double-blind experiment, acute effects of NIR and far-red wavelengths in ambient illumination on cognition, emotional state and cardiovascular health were examined in a sample of 151 university students (117 females, 34 males). During a 2-hour laboratory session, participants were monitored at rest and while engaged in cognitively demanding tasks across two counterbalanced lighting conditions. Both included 3500 K white light generated by a light-emitting diode (LED) system, while one additionally included LEDs with peak wavelengths in the NIR (875 nm, 960 nm) and far-red (735 nm) spectrum. The addition of NIR and far-red to the ambient lighting showed beneficial effects on resting high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), HF-HRV responses to cognitive demand, and feelings of pleasure, but reduced performance on a visual search task. These findings reveal that the absence of NIR from architectural lighting influences humans at a psychological and physiological level, with implications for health and well-being that need to be balanced with energy-saving considerations.",

Methods The physical load was assessed by the Occupational Repetitive Actions method, and the psychological load by the Job Stress Scale. A total of 259 workers in the footwear industry participated in this study. These loads were incorporated into a multi-objective mathematical programming model, where the objective functions aimed to minimize the maximum work-related musculoskeletal disorders and the maximum total work demand, and to maximize the minimum work control and social support to which a worker might be exposed during a daily journey. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature that physical and psychological aspects are considered when solving job rotation problems. To tackle the problem, we propose a matheuristic based on an epsilon-constraint framework. This method allows us to generate different solutions with respect to the specific objective functions. To assess the effectiveness of the solutions, we calculated the variance of the scores of the physical and psychological loads in the conditions without and with rotations. Results Five rotation solutions were reached for the sandal production cells and twelve for the tennis shoe production cells. There was a reduction in the variation of physical and psychological loads in all solutions for both cells when compared to the no rotation condition. However, for the sandal production cells, the reduction in variation between the physical loads of the conditions with and without rotations was not significant due to the similarity of the exposure indices. Conclusions The model reduces the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, promoting variability in muscle recruitment and enrichment of work content, being applicable in other segments.",

However, experimental results showed that trained and naïve human judges observing facial micro-expressions can distinguish liars from truth-tellers with an accuracy just slightly above the chance level. More promising results recently came from the field of artificial intelligence, in which machine learning (ML) techniques are used to identify micro-expressions and are trained to distinguish deceptive statements from genuine ones. In this paper, we test the ability of different feature extraction methods (i.e., improved dense trajectories, OpenFace) and ML techniques (i.e., support vector machines vs. deep neural networks) to distinguish liars from truth-tellers based on facial micro-expressions, using a new video data set collected in low-stakes situations.

Results highlighted that support vector machines (SVMs) coupled with OpenFace resulted in the best performing method (AUC = 0.72 videos without cognitive load; AUC = 0.78 videos with cognitive load). All the tested classifiers performed better when a cognitive load was imposed on the interviewee, confirming that the technique of increasing cognitive load during an interview facilitates deception recognition.

In the current study we created a virtual replica of a real-world, multi-level educational facility, and compared data collected in the VE vs. the real-world environment as participants completed identical navigational tasks. We found significant differences in all of the measures used, including distance covered, number of mistakes made, time for task completion, spatial memory, extent of backtracking, observation of directional signs, perceived uncertainty levels, perceived cognitive workload, and perceived task difficulty. We also analyzed potential age-related effects to look for heightened VE/real-world response discrepancies among older adult participants (age 55 or over) compared to younger adults (18–30 years of age). This analysis yielded no significant age-by-condition interaction effects. Finally, we examined the spatial distribution of self-reported wayfinding uncertainty across the building floorplan, finding that areas in which uncertainty was most pronounced were similar between the real-world and VE settings.

In addition to the LEiDA-based metrics of brain state lifetimes and probabilities, we also computed information-theoretic measures of Block Decomposition Method of complexity, Lempel-Ziv complexity and transition entropy. Information theoretic metrics are notable in their ability to compute relationships amongst sequences of states over time, compared to lifetime and probability, which capture the behaviour of each state in isolation. We then related task-based brain state metrics to fluid intelligence. We observed that brain states exhibited stable topology across a range of numbers of clusters (K = 2:15). Most metrics of brain state dynamics, including state lifetime, probability, and all information theoretic metrics, reliably differed between tasks. However, relationships between state dynamic metrics and cognitive abilities varied according to the task, the metric, and the value of K, indicating that there are contextual relationships between task-dependant state dynamics and trait cognitive ability. This study provides evidence that the brain reconfigures across time in response to cognitive demands, and that there are contextual, rather than generalisable, relationships amongst task, state dynamics, and cognitive ability.",

However, little research has been done on balancing the production quality and efficiency based on the effect of mental workload and complexity in the MMAL. This study aims to propose a mathematical model to formulate the multi-objective MMAL problem and the genetic algorithm is applied for problem solving due to the computational complexities. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that incorporating the impact of mental workload on performance into account can make the rolled throughput yield (RTY) and efficiency balance when designing the MMAL. Moreover, we also verify that improving the experience of the operators can mitigate the impact of mental workload on the quality and efficiency.",

In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human-centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limitations, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's implementation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom.

According to cognitive load and attention-based theories, AR guidance can reduce cognitive strain, enhancing task performance. The affordance of AR in industrial processes like assembly or disassembly for repair/maintenance has been exploited broadly. However, the prevailing studies on automated user interfaces for AR instruction development, specifically virtual scene creation and target generation for object mapping rendering, still need to be explored. Notably, production industries currently rely on outsourcing skilled professionals to create AR overlaying instructions using manufacturer input. However, the exactness of the disassembly repository is substantial to avoid defects in AR guidance particulars. This underscores the significance of generalized automated AR instruction development and emphasizes the demands for further research. In this work, the autonomous AR-integrated framework is developed for the disassembly context, empowering manufacturers to acquire desired outcomes across various modules. These modules include the validation of the manual user disassembly sequence repository during the prefatory phase of AR instruction creation and the provision of Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) input. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation/rendering of disassembly efforts in a virtual platform and the generation of rendering virtual display scenes for appropriate AR-guided object mapping. Furthermore, it enables the generation of essential model targets for registering the AR scenes. Subsequently, the extracted repositories (virtual scenes and model targets) are input into the Unity AR tool to create AR mapping guidance for disassembly operations. The performance of the autonomous disassembly module is evaluated through three case studies with different AR visualizations. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed framework is exploited by extracting feedback from experts regarding flexibility, compatibility, completion time, and cognitive level.",

Specifically, by using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a basis of the argument, the research examines how cognitive demands and possibilities for development mediate the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and work engagement. The research predicted that PSC positively increases work engagement via enhancement of positive demands (i.e., cognitive demands) and possibilities for development. The current study utilized a cross-sectional survey approach among 392 employees in one oil and gas organization in Malaysia. To test the research hypotheses, data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM). The study revealed that PSC increased possibilities for development and had no significant relationship with cognitive demands. Furthermore, the results supported the notion that working condition (possibilities for development) mediated the relationship between PSC and work engagement. Overall, these findings suggest that PSC plays a significant role as predictor for working conditions and work outcomes in oil and gas industry.

Research has shown that road markings and road signs, if properly designed and placed, can positively impact driver behaviour and thus overall road safety. However, it is still not completely clear how different levels of road markings and road signs visibility affect drivers in night-time conditions. For this reason, we used a driving simulator to simulate night-time conditions and different levels of visibility of road markings and road signs in order to analyse the connection between the visibility of these road elements and driver behaviour and cognitive load. The results suggest that the level of road markings and road signs visibility slight increased the driving speed (about 2%), but at the same time it had a positive effect on participants’ cognitive load which was at an optimal level during high visibility. Although there was no significant difference in participants’ eye movements and the number of gazes at road markings, the percentage share of looked road signs was the highest in high visibility conditions, which suggests that the participants were in most cases timely informed and aware of the upcoming situation.",

Employing the Expectancy– Confirmation Theory, this study conveniently sampled 393 apparel workers from four free zone exporting firms to gather data. The collected data was analyzed using regression in STATA 14. The study revealed that, although workers were not overburdened with workload, factors such as skills obsolescence, entrepreneurship intention, fairness and rewards had predictive effects on their organizational commitment and turnover intentions. Additionally, the study found that creative behavior and instrumental readiness moderated the relationship between entrepreneurship intention and turnover intention. Given the recent adverse impact of inflation on the economic value of workers' wages and the uncertainty stemming from operational changes regarding skills obsolescence, the study provides valuable insights into how these factors may influence workers’ organizational commitment and turnover intentions.

These transitions are particularly numerous in the US where healthcare systems are purchasing and implementing commercial EHRs to fulfill federal requirements. Despite the central role of EHRs to workflow, the cognitive impact of these transitions on the workforce has not been widely studied. This study assesses the changes in cognitive workload among pediatric nurses during data entry and retrieval tasks during transition from a hybrid electronic and paper information system to a commercial EHR. Materials and methods Baseline demographics and computer attitude and skills scores were obtained from 74 pediatric nurses in two wards. They also completed an established and validated instrument, the NASA-TLX, that is designed to measure cognitive workload; this instrument was used to evaluate cognitive workload of data entry and retrieval. The NASA-TLX was administered at baseline (pre-implementation), 1, 5 and 10 shifts and 4 months post-implementation of the new EHR. Results Most nurse participants experienced significant increases of cognitive workload at 1 and 5 shifts after “go-live”. These increases abated at differing rates predicted by participants’ computer attitudes scores (p=0.01). Conclusions There is substantially increased cognitive workload for nurses during the early phases (1–5 shifts) of EHR transitions. Health systems should anticipate variability across workers adapting to “meaningful use” EHRs. “One-size-fits-all” training strategies may not be suitable and longer periods of technical support may be necessary for some workers.",7

Smooth execution of such tasks requires spontaneous distribution of cognitive load at specific regions of brain based on its classification. A strong connectivity between peripheral sensors and central nervous system is thought to assist the cognitive load distribution effectively. Novelty of current study evaluates the modulation of foot pressure and its mapping with distributed cognitive load while executing attentional biased emotional tasks. Emotional stimulus in form of happy and sad faces with attentional paradigm drawn on them were used in the study. Behavioral results were measured with respect to the analysis of response time (RT) and response accuracy (%). Neurological signals were acquired using 10-channel EEG data acquisition system, whereas, another 6 channels were used to measure foot pressure in the left and right feet at three different locations of foot. Acquired signals were further analyzed in time and frequency domains to interpret the cognitive load distribution, and the influence of foot pressure on distribution of cognitive loads. We found that the foot pressure accelerated the response accuracy rate in attending the local scope of attention, which was not in the case of global scope of attention. This means that the global attention does not require any pressure from peripheral sensory neurons. Our event related potential (ERP) results revealed that the early sensory negative N100 characterized the processing of global scope of attention coupled with high-foot pressure. However, the late positive peak of P300 and P600 associated with local scope of attention along with high-foot pressure. The global scope of attention with low-foot pressure modulates delta and theta oscillations. These results largely contribute to the literature on cognitive neuroscience of attention and it corelation with the peripheral sensory foot pressure.",

The present study investigated the effects of cognitive load addition on postural control and status of topographical brain activity in quiet and perturbed standing. Sixteen healthy young people participated in four main levels of the experiment, including two levels of physical difficulty with and without math questions in the form of mental calculations. Cortical electrical activity and postural sways were recorded simultaneously using a 19-channel electroencephalography and motion analysis method to measure body movements by a high-speed camera and active markers. Analysis of variance showed significant effects of the cognitive perturbation on theta band energy of the frontal (p < .001) and temporal (p = .030) regions. Approximate entropy metrics of the brain frontal activity and also the movements of the center of mass were reduced by cognitive loads (p < .05). The energy of theta band EEG signals was positively correlated to the overall mechanical work in easier tasks (r = 0.59), and the CoM stability metrics in the more difficult tasks (r > 0.57). Addition of the cognitive loads to a postural task reduced the stability by higher levels of brain cortex involvement. Addition of the second cognitive task to standing reduced the complexity of both neural and motor activities.

The results show that, by using a random forest algorithm which selects features according to information gain, the accuracy of classifying the mental workload can be as high as 94% in the testing phase. Thus, the mental workload perceived by the operator can be estimated from physiological parameters. This finding can support Industry 5.0 applications in human–robot collaboration with a human-centric approach.",

The application of advanced automation technology in manufacturing systems has tremendously increased manufacturing flexibility; however, this creates significant mental pressure for operators who must deal with a series of decisions, and this decreases their job satisfaction. In this study, we primarily investigated how cognitive automation and mechanical automaton in the material handling system affect manufacturing flexibility. Cognitive automation is defined as a computerized system that provides relevant information to operators, thereby reducing the cognitive workload; mechanical automation refers to an automated system to reduce the physical workload. The case of a truck-body production line of a truck company was investigated by applying modified DYNAMO++ for the material handling system. Then, a simulation program, AnyLogic 6.9.0 was used to investigate the effect of the cognitive and mechanical automation in the material handling system on manufacturing flexibility. The research results showed that the levels of cognitive and mechanical automation of the material handling system were increased by 52.4% and 48.0%, respectively, which resulted in improving manufacturing flexibility by 14.2% in cycle time, 53.3% in downtime, and 26.3% in the number of tasks. Cognitive automation, in particular, contributed total improvements in cycle time and downtime of 64.2% and 74.1%, respectively, which showed that cognitive automation has a very critical effect on manufacturing flexibility in the material handling system.",

However, in shared physical spaces, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can raise new safety concerns as workers' mental health can be adversely affected by poor communication between the two peers. To create a harmonized, safe HRC, this study proposes a worker-centered collaborative framework that enables robots to capture workers' brainwaves from wearable electroencephalograph, evaluate their task-related cognitive load, and adjust the robotic performance accordingly. The framework was examined by asking 14 subjects to execute a collaborative construction task with a terrestrial robot under various levels of cognitive loads.

This lack of AM talent is a major hurdle for organizations looking for innovative solutions to solve emerging engineering problems. Developing institutional talent in DfAM and AM process knowledge is of paramount importance to support organizations looking to leverage AM. Therefore, future designers need meaningful experiences to acquire DfAM intuition and AM process competency to enable informed artifact generation during the design process. This necessitates supplying active experiences that highlight the advantages and limitations of AM technologies and promote DfAM intuition. However, limited access to in-person experiences with physical AM systems inhibits designers from gaining such intuition. Digital modalities of AM education, such as computer-aided (CAx) and virtual reality (VR) tools, can alternatively provide access to experiential learning to cultivate this AM expertise. Where CAx experiences are typically associated with non-immersive modalities, VR experiences can offer enhanced immersion to replicate in-person experiences. There is a gap in the literature, however, that investigates immersive and non-immersive modalities on their effectiveness in training and artifact generation for AM. Additionally, there is a scarcity of information on design guides for creating immersive experiences that can support these research endeavors. It is essential to establish guidance on designing immersive experiences that offer meaningful and active engagement with AM technologies. Such guidance will support the development of experiences that cultivate DfAM intuition, AM process competency, and problem-solving skills. This research is thus motivated to explore the design of immersive VR experiences for problem-solving and artifact generation with AM. For this purpose, this work presents a generalized framework to inform the design of such experiences along with an example created using the proposed framework.",

Indeed, this paper addresses the need for a human-centered framework proposing a preference-based optimization algorithm in a human–robot collaboration (HRC) scenario with an ergonomics assessment to improve working conditions. The HRC application consists of optimizing a collaborative robot end-effector pose during an object-handling task. The following approach (AmPL-RULA) utilizes an Active multi-Preference Learning (AmPL) algorithm, a preference-based optimization method, where the user is requested to iteratively provide qualitative feedback by expressing pairwise preferences between a couple of candidates. To address physical well-being, an ergonomic performance index, Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), is combined with the user’s pairwise preferences, so that the optimal setting can be computed.

Improved scheduling practices not only enhance the quality of care provided but also contribute to better job satisfaction and overall well-being of the nursing staff. Despite the importance of this task, nurse scheduling is often conducted manually by head nurses, which is both challenging and time-consuming. This study proposes a mathematical model that addresses the nurse scheduling problem, with a specific application in a French hospital department. The objectives of the model are to accommodate a wide range of constraints flexibly, ensure balanced workloads and shifts, and align with the preferences of the nursing staff. A significant contribution of this research is the theoretical investigation and comparison of various workload balancing criteria tailored to the specific context of the problem. The study analyzes different workload balancing criteria to formulate an efficient scheduling solution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through large experiments and practice feedback, confirming its potential to enhance both healthcare efficiency and nurses’ well-being.",

However, there is a gap between the high-level references made to cognitive fit and the low-level ability to identify and measure it during human interaction with visualizations. We bridge this gap by using an electroencephalography metric derived from frontal midline theta power and parietal alpha power, known as the task load index, to determine if cognitive effort measured at the level of cortical activity is less when cognitive fit is present compared to when cognitive fit is not. We found that when there is cognitive fit between the type of problem to be solved and the information displayed by a system, the task load index is lower compared to when cognitive fit is not present. We support this finding with subjective (NASA task load index) and performance (response time and accuracy) measures. Our approach, using electroencephalography, provides supplemental information to self-report and performance measures. Findings from this study are important because they (1) provide more validity to the cognitive fit theory using a neurophysiological measure, and (2) use the electroencephalography task load index metric as a means to assess cognitive workload and effort in general.",

However, researchers have not yet clearly determined whether this impairment is due to marijuana-induced alterations in the developing nervous system and whether this deficit persists into adulthood after marijuana use has ceased. We administered anandamide to developing rats to assess the effect of cannabinoids on development. We subsequently evaluated learning and performance on a temporal bisection task in adulthood and assessed the expression of genes encoding principal subunits of NMDA receptors (Grin1, Grin2A, and Grin2B) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Rats in two age groups, namely, 21-day-old and 150-day-old rats, received intraperitoneal injections of anandamide or the vehicle for 14 days. Both groups performed a temporal bisection test, which included listening to tones of different durations and classifying them as short or long. The expression of the Grin1, Grin2A and Grin2B mRNAs was evaluated using quantitative PCR in both age groups after extracting mRNA from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We observed a learning impairment in the temporal bisection task (p < 0.05) and changes in the response latency (p < 0.05) in rats that received anandamide. Furthermore, these rats exhibited decreased expression of Grin2b (p = 0.001) compared to those that received the vehicle. In human subjects, the use of cannabinoids during development induces a long-term deficit, but this deficit is not observed in subjects who use cannabinoids in adulthood. Rats treated with anandamide earlier in development took longer to learn the task, suggesting that anandamide exerts a harmful effect on cognition in developing rats. Administration of anandamide during early stages of development induced deficits in learning and other cognitive processes that depend on an adequate estimation of time. The cognitive demands of the environment must be considered when evaluating the cognitive effects of cannabinoids on developing or mature brains. High cognitive demands might induce differential expression of NMDA receptors that improves cognitive capacity, overcoming altered glutamatergic function",

Each stakeholder has implemented different technology-based systems to record and track product transactions. However, these systems work in silos, and there is no intra-system communication, leading to a lack of complete supply chain traceability for all apparel stakeholders. Moreover, apparel stakeholders are reluctant to share their business information with business competitors; thus, they involve third-party auditors to ensure the quality of the final product. Furthermore, the apparel manufacturing industry faces challenges with counterfeit products, making it difficult for consumers to determine the authenticity of the products. Therefore, in this paper, a trustworthy apparel product traceability framework called ChainApparel is developed using the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain to address these challenges of authenticity and traceability of apparel products. Specifically, multiple smart contracts are designed and developed for registration, process execution, audit, fault, and product traceability to authorize, validate, and trace every business transaction among the apparel stakeholders. Further, the real-time performance analysis of ChainApparel is carried out regarding transaction throughput and latency by deploying the compute nodes at different geographical locations using Hyperledger Fabric. The results conclude that ChainApparel accomplished significant performance under diverse workloads while ensuring complete traceability along the complex supply chain of the apparel industry.

The experimental results demonstrate that using our proposed sampling method yields pose data of grid points that have only a small deviation from directly sampled results and are only slightly higher than the robot's repeat positioning accuracy. Moreover, our proposed method can significantly reduce the sampling workload by 60% under the experimental conditions of this study (sampling 10 groups of data within 90 degrees range), with increasing sampling range leading to more obvious efficiency improvements. Finally, we show that compared to the IDW algorithm, the Kriging interpolation algorithm yields better results and improves the mean absolute positioning accuracy of robots after compensation by 30%.",

In this study, we mainly consider the interaction between production scheduling and maintenance, while optimizing the job scheduling problem in a serial–parallel hybrid two-stage production system. We formulate the problem by introducing the stochastic and workload-ratio degradation, and the actual job completion time and maintenance costs can be modeled according to the degradation status of each machine. To solve this problem, a two-step opportunistic maintenance (OM) strategy is developed, and finally an adaptive random-key genetic algorithm (GA) is designed by incorporating the OM coefficients.

Participant's thermal comfort, emotion, and self-rated workload were assessed using a subjective questionnaire, while their performance was quantitatively evaluated using a neurobehavioral test. The data was analyzed to establish how the various thermal environmental factors influence performance, workload, emotion, and thermal sensations. The results show that the highest performance within the experimental thermal environmental conditions was observed when the thermal sensation ranges from neutral to slightly warm (+0.20) at the 23.5 °C mean standard effective temperature. At the same sensation, the occupant's mood disturbance and the mental workload for completing the task were minimal. These results would be helpful for facility managers of buildings by giving them insight into the impact of under or over-heating spaces on occupant performance during winter in the composite climate of India.",

This study investigates a situation relevant for Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) as well as Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO), where the decision-maker needs to make a series of choices between nondominated options characterized by multiple objectives. The cognitive capacity of humans is limited, which leads to cognitive burden that influences human decision-makers’ decisions. We measure how the varying number of objectives influences cognitive burden in a laboratory study, and the impacts that this burden has on the decision-makers’ behavior and the consistency of their decisions. We use psychophysiological, behavioral, and self-report methods. Our results suggest that a higher number of objectives (i) increases cognitive burden significantly, (ii) leads to adopting strategies in which only a limited number of objectives is considered, and (iii) decreases decision consistency.",

To bridge this gap, by integrating generative adversarial network, autoencoder, machine learning, and robot adaptation techniques, this study proposes a novel physiological computing system that enables the collaborative robot to efficiently perceive workers’ psychological states and regulate its performance seamlessly.

Unfortunately, operators do not often comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and do not always exhibit the consistency and commitment required to collect high-quality data. In fact, data collection is often perceived as a non-value-adding activity that increases workloads and lowers productivity. We aim to empirically study the extent to which compliance with SOPs for data collection is affected by some of the key factors. Using a large dataset obtained from a leading postal service provider in Australia, we find that an operator’s workload, fatigue, and related work experience directly impact the compliance levels. We also find that a company’s compliance reinforcement intervention to improve compliance behavior can moderate these impacts.",

The workload of the ATCos can have negative effects on operational safety and airspace usage. To avoid overloading and ensure an acceptable workload level for the ATCos, it is important to predict the ATCos’ workload accurately for mitigation actions. In this paper, we first perform a review of research on ATCo workload, mostly from the air traffic perspective. Then, we briefly introduce the setup of the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with retired ATCos, where the air traffic data and workload labels are obtained. The simulations are conducted under three Phoenix approach scenarios while the human ATCos are requested to self-evaluate their workload ratings (i.e., low-1 to high-7). Preliminary data analysis is conducted. Next, we propose a graph-based deep-learning framework with conformal prediction to identify the ATCo workload levels. The number of aircraft under the controller’s control varies both spatially and temporally, resulting in dynamically evolving graphs. The experiment results suggest that (a) besides the traffic density feature, the traffic conflict feature contributes to the workload prediction capabilities (i.e., minimum horizontal/vertical separation distance); (b) directly learning from the spatiotemporal graph layout of airspace with graph neural network can achieve higher prediction accuracy, compare to hand-crafted traffic complexity features; (c) conformal prediction is a valuable tool to further boost model prediction accuracy, resulting a range of predicted workload labels.

We implement this to understand the processes driving eye direction and movements during diverse cognitive tasks, providing new insights into this field. Our paper begins with a detailed description of the procedures for collecting and preprocessing EEG data related to gaze behavior. We then elaborate on the development of an IRL framework designed to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of eye movements (scanpaths) in participants engaged in cognitive tasks of varying complexity. Our model is tailored to accommodate the complexities inherent in neural signals and the stochastic nature of human gaze patterns. Our research findings underscore IRL’s effectiveness in precisely forecasting gaze patterns based on a combination of EEG and image data. The correlation between the model’s predictions and the actual gaze behavior observed in controlled experiments reinforces the utility of IRL in cognitive neuroscience research.

Near Solidus Forming (NSF) processes emerge as a promising alternative to confront such issues, offering the capability to fabricate intricate components reliably while minimizing material waste and energy consumption. This promising manufacturing process is still in its developmental stages for industrial applications, necessitating further exploration and understanding of various factors such as friction, heat transfer, and others. From the literature review, a lack of friction data at these temperatures has been identified. Therefore, this study is dedicated to the advanced characterization of the friction coefficient for Near Solidus Forging (NSF) operations. With that aim, T-shape experimental tests of 42CrMo4 alloy steel have been conducted at high temperatures (up to 1360 °C). Additionally, a lack of consensus on the correct T-shape testing and inverse analysis procedure has been noted. Consequently, apart from the experimental work, an in-depth analysis of the friction coefficient identification procedure has been conducted. As a result, a new geometrical output index is proposed, highly sensitive to the friction coefficient and therefore more reliable compared to state-of-the-art indexes. Furthermore, the influence of the selected geometrical output index and the consideration of sample-to-sample transfer and holding times were studied. Results showed that the increase in workload to consider the sample-to-sample transfer and holding times is not worthwhile, as assuming the average values lead to significantly less work with little impact in the final results (<5 % of error). The study also concludes that a friction coefficient of 0.25, 0.45 and 0.6 has been identified at temperatures of 1250 °C, 1300 °C and 1360 °C, respectively. Additionally, the result of thermal camera showed good agreement with the thermocouple data. Overall, in this study a robust and reliable T-shape testing, and friction coefficient identification procedure is proposed and validated.",

Can these educational inequalities be driven by specific testing practices? This study addresses this question by innovatively using data from the largest worldwide standardized test and exploiting the random variation in the format of the tests assigned to students. I find that there is a noticeable widening of the gender gap when a larger share of questions is multiple-choice, rather than filling-the-gap questions. A 10 percentage point increase in the share of multiple-choice questions inflates female under-performance in mathematics by 0.025 standard deviations and male under-performance in reading by 0.035 standard deviations. This accounts for nearly one-quarter of the overall gender disparity found in these subjects. I provide suggestive evidence that ruling out alternative options, rather than coming up with an entire answer, may contribute to cognitive information overload among students with lower confidence levels (generally girls in mathematics and boys in reading). These cognitive loads, in turn, have implications for a student's future level of effort and performance.",

Concentration changes in HbO and HbR help in classifying the cognitive states of human brain. There are several machine learning classification techniques to distinguish different cognitive states. Some conventional machine learning methods, which are easier to implement, undergo a complex processing phase before training the network and also suffer from low accuracy due to inappropriate data preprocessing. Deep learning based convolutional neural network (CNN) having automatic feature engineering capability plays a very important role in efficiently classifying different cognitive states. The present work uses two open-access datasets on fNIRS signal. The datasets are taken for two cognitive states: mental task (MT) and resting state or baseline task (BL).

To achieve this objective, a comprehensive analysis of seat installation process for commercial aircraft was carried out to identify and describe criticalities associated with this manufacturing phase. Different means were used to gather information, starting from the analysis of technical documents, and conducting interviews with industry experts. The research methodology employs a unique translation mechanism, harnessing the power of scoring matrices which are based on a graduated scale ranging from 1 (best option) to 5 (worst option). The scoring matrix serves as a tool for quantifying and translating the qualitative data gathered from the experts into quantitative analysis reflecting the installation process workload. By quantifying the qualitative information provided by the experts, this approach enables a systematic evaluation of seat installation and aids in decision-making within the aircraft assembly domain. In essence, this research contributes a structured and rigorous framework for assessing the ease of installing aircraft components, with a specific emphasis on seats, resulting in an improved assembly process of aircraft.",

To build on these findings, we investigated the influence of low-level visual properties on scene preference, cognitive load, and eye-movements. In the present study, participants viewed a mixture of unaltered and altered photographs of nature and urban scenes to determine if low-level visual properties influenced responses to scenes. Altered versions included photographs with only low or mid-to-high visual spatial frequency information, and photographs where the phase or amplitude of visual spatial frequencies had been scrambled. We replicated past findings, demonstrating preference and longer fixation-time for nature scenes versus urban cities. We then demonstrated that the visual spatial frequencies and power spectra contained in images significantly influenced preference, cognitive load, and eye-movements, and can partially explain the restoration response to natural environments.",

We then investigate how increasing task demand affects a user's pupil data during interaction with a computerized decision aid. Our results suggest that pupillometry has the potential to serve as a reliable, objective, continuous and unobtrusive measure of task demand and that the adaptive decision making theory may serve as a suitable framework for studying user pupillary responses in the IS domain.",

However, with many tasks performed simultaneously with flying, the relevant information is typically dispersed on a number of screens overloading the operator's visual channel. In order to address these unique human-factors problems associated with unmanned vehicles we suggest the use of an auditory display as a mean to reduce visual workload, to enhance situation awareness, and mitigate the visual and cognitive demands of contemporary marine teleoperations. Experiments were performed on the remotely operated surface marine platform (PlaDyPos) developed at the Laboratory for Underwater Systems and Technologies, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb. The results show that the concept, guidance-by-sound is feasible in the real environment. The results are in line with previously obtained results from the real-time simulator showing that tracking quality can be further improved introducing supernormal auditory cues in order to provide better-than-normal operator's auditory resolution in the frontal region. We conclude that the use of hearing in the form of the auditory display emerges as an important advantage. Since practice has a major effect on performance, there is definitely more room for improvement in using interfaces we are not trained for.",3

Due to additional cognitive load it induces, SDL has been in some cases found to be detrimental for learning, especially for students with a lower cognitive capacity. With this study, we explored some of the causes for the variability in learning gains. We examined 111 middle school students' self-directed category learning using an exploratory web-task for autonomous learning, focusing on their information search (browsing a taxonomy of unknown dinosaurs) and their memorization of respective category labels. We were interested to detect whether students’ performance in a complex span task (Ospan) was also reflected in their search and learning behavior. Results revealed different learning gain trajectories in the latter task, where higher WMC students were more confident about their learning. Also, the students with lower WMC were found to search the taxonomy by repeatedly searching the same (basic type of) dinosaur exemplar. In line with prior findings about human mental capacity restrictions and cognitive load theory, the present work evidenced the important role of students’ resistance to distraction, and its relation to differences in self-directed search and memorizing. The results imply the need to teach metacognitive skills and offer supportive scaffolding in order to avoid cognitive overload in SDL.",

This paper addresses the problem of assigning workers to tasks in a workshop system. In this context, recent researches have focused on the ergonomics assessment, often neglecting the evaluation of the workers’ performance. This study aims to formulate a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the workforce scheduling problem and improve the performance of the system integrating ergonomics and human skills. To overcome the complexity of the combinatorial problem, a constructive heuristic procedure is developed. Moreover, a novel approach is proposed to determine the workers’ skills. Human performance is modelled in terms of the time required to perform consecutive tasks, considering different sequences of tasks. In addition, the model was applied to a real case study to verify its feasibility. Different scenarios are tested, considering different levels of exposure to different risk factors. The results indicate that a limited increase in the makespan enables decreasing the risk level and the achievement of an excellent workload balance among workers in terms of time spent in performing tasks. Moreover, the heuristic procedure has demonstrated to perform well on instances of realistic size, and it could be adapted to many manufacturing systems to solve the problem in real industrial contexts.",

It entailed the need for developing appropriate reasoning schemes for efficient process planning to take advantage of machining capabilities inherent in these machines. This paper addresses an adequate methodical approach for a non-linear process planning with a variety of alternatives, enabled through the STEP_NC standard. A relevant algorithmic approach of high efficacy is developed for feature clustering and operation sequencing based on AND-OR graph modelling. It involves a discrete modelling scheme for setup formulation so that the workload of machine spindles is levelled and its total cycle time is minimized. The so-formulated optimization problem, and related in particular to feature distribution among setups, can be successfully solved by a non-linear generalized reduced gradient (GRC) algorithm. The solution algorithms outlined can be relatively readily implemented in industrial informatics systems of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises.

The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) is a popular measure for this purpose. However, acceptability of workload is difficult to interpret based on the scores, and the measure is time consuming for use in test scenario breaks. This paper reports the identification and evaluation of a one-item subjective rating for the acceptability of mental workload. Study 1 found that one item, mental demand, highly represented the multidimensional TLX and that operators rated this item to be distinct from performance and situation awareness. Study 2 investigated the acceptance scale's sensitivity to control room modification, and the study found that operators' rating of level of mental demand and rating of acceptability of mental demand were moderately related. The rating of acceptability, compared with the original scale, was more sensitive to control room modernisation and was more strongly related to subjective performance. Operators' rating of acceptable workload was significantly related to observers' assessment of team performance, while the rating of level was not. Both acceptable and non-acceptable workload were related to high levels of the original TLX scales, indicating that operators' perception of acceptable workload was not fixated on a particular level of the original TLX scale. The results supported that efficient assessment can be achieved by applying only the TLX mental demand item and by supplementing or replacing the original rating scale with an acceptability rating scale. The approach presented applies to establishing ‘redlines’ for human performance constructs beyond mental workload. Relevance to industry High-consequence industries are required to perform human factors validation for new and substantially modified design. While numerous human factors measures are available, approaches for establishing cut-off scores or ‘redlines’ are lacking. This paper investigates acceptability rating to address this challenge.",

The key of obtaining a quantitative model of regret theory is to measure the preference in humans’ mind when they choose among a set of options. Unlike physical quantities, measuring psychological preference is not procedure invariant, i.e. the readings alter when the methods change. In this work, we alleviate this influence by choosing the procedure compatible with the way that an individual makes a choice. We believe the resulting model is closer to the nature of human decision-making. The preference elicitation process is decomposed into a series of short surveys to reduce cognitive workload and increase response accuracy. To make the questions natural and familiar to the subjects, we follow the insight that humans generate, quantify and communicate preference in natural language. The fuzzy sets theory is hence utilized to model responses from subjects. Based on these ideas, a graphical human-computer interface (HCI) is designed to articulate the information as well as to efficiently collect human responses. The design also accounts for human heuristics and biases, e.g. range effect and anchoring effect, to enhance its reliability. The overall performance of the survey is satisfactory because the measured model shows prediction accuracy equivalent to the subjects revisit performance.",34

A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate dual-task manipulations.",

Within cellular systems, made of independent, modular and flexible working areas, tailored on families of similar products, Serus are of increasing adoption for both manufacturing and assembly tasks. Among them, the so-called divisional Serus are the first step to move from the traditional production lines to a production environment made of a set of identical working areas, parallelising activities and enabling potential productivity increase. Despite their adoption in industry, starting from the electronic sector and moving forward, reference analytic models to predict divisional Seru productivity are rare in the literature, while their formulation and application is a gap to fill. This paper addresses this gap in theory, supporting the transition toward Seru production environment by proposing and proofing the analytic closed-form expressions getting the expected productivity of a divisional Seru made of a generic number of workers and a) one (base case), b) two (extension) and c) a generic number (general case) of product types to produce. Together with the steps to get the productivity expressions for these three cases of immediate practical applicability and not yet proposed by the literature, a case study and sensitivity analysis on the divisional Seru dimension showcase the proposed model industrial use and impact on the expected productivity. Key results highlight a stationary behaviour of the working time for all workers making the Seru productivity dependent on the sum of the workers speed and the product type workloads.",

High mental workload is known to involve bilateral hemisphere activation, but the patterns of effective connectivity (directed causal influence or communication) among brain regions in such a context remain unclear. This study investigated the effect of mental workload on the causal influence brain regions exert over each other under a multitasking scenario. The Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) method was implemented to infer the flow of information and allocation of attentional resources. Thirty participants performed four subtasks with varying levels of workload on a computer-based multitasking program, simulating a pilot cockpit. Using eight brain regions commonly identified to be activated in multitasking conditions, nine candidate models were developed. Bayesian model averaging was then used to quantify the connectivity strengths among the brain regions. Linear regression was conducted to study the relationships between connection strengths and subtask performances. The results showed that the causal connections shifted from the left to both sides of the brain with increased workload. Linear regression analysis showed that the subtask performance could be predicted by connectivity strengths. Thus, by studying the brain dynamics of mental workload, we may be able to develop a predictor that supplements subjective self-report measures.",

Under this policy, the maintenance process has assumed a significant role as an integral part of the manufacturing process and not only as a dependency of the company. In this study, proposals for improving a port company's maintenance procedure will be analyzed using the discrete event simulation technique. The findings at the task execution stage reveal delays or queues that have a direct impact on the overall time necessary to accomplish maintenance. The reason that the equipment in the locations is not available on time could be due to a lack of supplies or replacement parts required to finish the repair. This has a negative impact on the scheduled maintenance times. Additionally, the simulation results show that incorporating one person into the process improves reaction times.

Thirty live captioners participated in the study, completing questionnaires and interviews. Results showed that the subjective mental workload of live captioners is high, similar to that of neurosurgeons. The mental workload was found to be associated with caption paraphrasing and employment status. The challenges of the job, such as the speed of speaking in live content, cognitive tasks involved in paraphrasing, the concern about poor performance, the impact on audiences, and the lack of control over job scheduling contribute to this high workload. These findings suggest the need for modulating the scheduling of the workers, having longer breaks, and working in teams rather than independently. Introducing paradigm changes for live captioning workflow, such as reducing the human effort of typing by adopting auto-generated captions, so that captioners become decision-makers or managers of generational AI systems should also be considered.

Logistic company ussualy work based on order from manufacturer. Depending on the circumtances, orders received by logistic service provider in most cases are uncertain. Fluctuations or uncertainty of order becomes a problem to many logistic companies because it affects the way they have to schedule their workers. Workforce scheduling is hence necessary for allocating appropriate worker in the right place and in the right time. Inappropriate workforce scheduling could imbalance workloads within workers which leads to worker dissatisfaction. This study therefore aims to design a workforce scheduling that consider worker workload of Domestics Freight Forwarding particularly in Company X. The research will first measure the workload, both physical and mental workload. The method used for physical workload measurement is based on calorie consumptions based on Indonesia National Standard (SNI). Whereas NASA-TLX subjective approach method is used to measure mental workload. Then, by using the result of the workload measurements, a workforce scheduling model is designed to balance the workload. Goal programing is used to model the workforce scheduling. The result of workload measurement shows that workers have low productivity but high level of mental workload, while for the physical workload there is no significant difference in each warehouse and shipping. In order to increase the utility of the workers, instead of 3 shifts it is suggested that company apply 2 shifts work systems for Checker.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning method, termed the Human as AI mentor-based deep reinforcement learning (HAIM-DRL) framework, which facilitates safe and efficient autonomous driving in mixed traffic platoon. Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, we first introduce an innovative learning paradigm that effectively injects human intelligence into AI, termed Human as AI mentor (HAIM). In this paradigm, the human expert serves as a mentor to the AI agent. While allowing the agent to sufficiently explore uncertain environments, the human expert can take control in dangerous situations and demonstrate correct actions to avoid potential accidents. On the other hand, the agent could be guided to minimize traffic flow disturbance, thereby optimizing traffic flow efficiency. In detail, HAIM-DRL leverages data collected from free exploration and partial human demonstrations as its two training sources. Remarkably, we circumvent the intricate process of manually designing reward functions; instead, we directly derive proxy state-action values from partial human demonstrations to guide the agents’ policy learning. Additionally, we employ a minimal intervention technique to reduce the human mentor’s cognitive load. Comparative results show that HAIM-DRL outperforms traditional methods in driving safety, sampling efficiency, mitigation of traffic flow disturbance, and generalizability to unseen traffic scenarios.",

Their tractability is however essential for the efficiency of state-of-the-art industries. This is particularly the case in the semiconductor industry that faces high mix and low volume conditions, and for which traditional methods fail to capture the high complexity and require continuous actions and corrections to adjust to heterogeneous toolsets and product-mix. We present the Concurrent WIP (CWIP), a new way of studying such systems at the level of a process-cluster by identifying each job's queue from its own perspective. CWIP is designed to be practical, with a low level of resource investments, yet informative. We explain how CWIP can be computed based on historical data and then used to derive capacity estimates and clearing functions without any assumptions on the system or on the form of the functions. In the process, we derive not only an average workload-dependent capacity, but also a confidence interval on this capacity. The relevance and efficiency of the proposed estimates are experimentally tested on a simulated system mimicking a small but complex process-cluster of the semiconductor industry. The estimates are used to predict WIP absorption times and we show how they characterize well not only the average behavior but also the full range of possible behaviors of the system. Finally, we discuss further applications of CWIP, that could be used to compute refined clearing functions or to monitor complex systems.",10

One hundred and fifty secondary school students (Mage = 15.31 years, SD = .64) took part in the experiment. They were quasi-randomly (i.e., matched for gender) assigned to the six experimental conditions and asked to rate their perceived cognitive load (i.e., mental effort invested and estimated difficulty), indicate their attitudes (i.e., attention, enjoyment, engagement and challenge) and perform the learning tests (i.e., game comprehension test and game performance test) immediately after the learning phase. Results showed that for low-complexity content, both formats of visualization have similar effects on cognitive load investment, and learning outcomes. However, for medium and high complexity contents, the dynamic format had a clear advantage over the static format in terms of cognitive load investment and learning outcomes. Moreover, it was found that whatever the level of content complexity, students exposed to the dynamic visualization reported more positive attitudes compared to those exposed to the static visualization. Considering the learning outcomes and the subjective experiences (i.e., cognitive load and attitudes), the results recommend the use of dynamic visualizations for learning basketball tactical actions whatever the level of content complexity.",

By resembling the age of craft manufacturing, Industry 4.0 expedites the alteration from mass production to mass customization. When distributed 3D printers (3DPs) are shared and collaborated in the IIoT, a promising dynamic, globalized, economical, and time-effective manufacturing environment for customized products will appear. However, the optimum allocation and scheduling of the personalized 3D printing tasks (3DPTs) in the IIoT in a manner that respects the customized attributes submitted for each model while satisfying not only the real-time requirements but also the workload balancing between the distributed 3DPs is an inevitable research challenge that needs further in-depth investigations. Therefore, to address this issue, this paper proposes a real-time green-aware multi-task scheduling architecture for personalized 3DPTs in the IIoT. The proposed architecture is divided into two interconnected folds, namely, allocation and scheduling. A robust online allocation algorithm is proposed to generate the optimal allocation for the 3DPTs. This allocation algorithm takes into consideration meeting precisely the customized user-defined attributes for each submitted 3DPT in the IIoT as well as balancing the workload between the distributed 3DPs simultaneously with improving their energy efficiency. Moreover, meeting the predefined deadline for each submitted 3DPT is among the main objectives of the proposed architecture. Consequently, an adaptive real-time multi-task priority-based scheduling (ARMPS) algorithm has been developed. The built ARMPS algorithm respects both the dynamicity and the real-time requirements of the submitted 3DPTs. A set of performance evaluation tests has been performed to thoroughly investigate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results proved the robustness and scalability of the proposed architecture that surpasses its counterpart state-of-the-art architectures, especially in high-load environments.",

However, the actual direction of this relation is uncertain, since most studies investigated the role of cognitive load on EBR by employing visual tasks only. Here we aimed at elucidating the relationship between EBR and cognitive load in non-visual tasks. Sixteen healthy participants performed two auditory oddball tasks, i.e. passive listening to auditory tones versus active counting of target tones; each oddball task was immediately followed by a rest phase. Throughout the oddball tasks we assessed EBR and recorded the P300 on ERPs as an electrophysiological measure of attention. The results showed that participants’ EBR increased during the active task compared to the respective rest phase. Amplitude and latency of the P300 too differed between passive and active tasks, but changes in EBR and P300 features were not correlated with each other. Our findings demonstrated that an increase in cognitive load is associated with an increase in EBR in cognitive tasks not involving visual attention. These findings are consistent with previous evidence suggesting shared neurobiological bases between attention and EBR.",

This research presents a low cost software solution based on a simplified skeleton model that uses operator position and workload data extracted from a simulation model used for virtual manufacturing process planning.

Existing unimodal workload recognition for seafarers mainly focuses on fixed load induction in bridge simulators, whereas a multimodal approach using multi-sensor data fusion can overcome the reliability and sensitivity limitations of a single sensor. To accurately identify the workload of seafarers, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal fusion method at the feature layer and utilise the Gini index to determine the feature weight of the multimodal data. Through a real ship navigation experiment, the subjective workload assessment technique (SWAT) was employed to collect the continuous workload scores of 24 seafarers in daily tasks. Further, the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory was used to integrate these scores with the unsafe behavior probability of seafarers to obtain a calibrated workload. Electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals were collected in real time, and a high-dimensional feature matrix was extracted to construct the workload recognition model. Random forest, XGBoost, and back-propagation neural networks were used to establish multimodal fusion workload recognition models at the feature-fusion stage, and the model performances were compared. The results showed that the multimodal fusion based on EEG, ECG, and EDA had an excellent recognition accuracy. The XGBoost algorithm has better performance with an accuracy of 85.72%, which is an increment of 9.49% compared to that of the unimodal algorithm, and this improvement passed the statistical significance test. Important features suitable for multimodal fusion recognition were also analysed. The findings of this study have profound significance for enhancing risk control measures pertaining to human factors and ensuring navigation safety.",

However, surprisingly, it remains unclear how this MD network is related to a core component of cognition, the process of searching for a target among distractors. This was because previous neuroimaging studies of visual search were confounded by task difficulty or time on task. To circumvent these limitations, we examined human brain activity while participants perform two different visual search tasks. The performance of a task was limited by increased attentional demand, while the other task was primarily limited by poor quality of input data or neural noise. Throughout the MD network, increased activity and strengthened functional connectivity among the MD regions were observed under the search task recruiting capacity-limited attentional resources. The present findings provide unequivocal evidence that the MD network mediates visual search, as well as other capacity-limited cognitive processes.",

We assessed the effects of cognitive load and speed on the pattern and variability of the ILC in young people during walking. Thirty healthy young people (19 female and 11 male) participated in this study. They were asked to perform 9 walking trials on a treadmill, including walking at three paces (preferred, slower and faster) either without a cognitive task (single-task walking) or while subtracting 1׳s or 3׳s from a random three-digit number (simple and complex dual-task walking, respectively). Deviation phase (DP) and mean absolute relative phase (MARP) values—indicators of variability and phase dynamic of ILC, respectively—were calculated using the data collected by a motion capture system. We used a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance for statistical analysis. The results showed that cognitive load had a significant main effect on DP of right shank–foot and thigh–shank, left shank–foot and pelvis–thigh (p<0.05), and MARP of both thigh–shank segments (p<0.01). In addition, the main effect of walking speed was significant on DP of all segments in each side and MARP of both thigh–shank and pelvis–thigh segments (p<0.001). The interaction of cognitive load and walking speed was only significant for MARP values of left shank–foot and right pelvis–thigh (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively).

However, configuring such machines requires technical experts, which are hard to find, especially for small and medium enterprises. Therefore, the process needs to be simplified by allowing non-experts to configure robots. During such configuration, one key aspect is the definition of objects’ grasping poses. The literature proposes deep learning techniques to compute grasping poses automatically and facilitate the process. Nevertheless, practical implementation for inexperienced factory operators can be challenging, especially if task-specific knowledge and constraints should be considered. To overcome this barrier, we propose an approach that facilitates teaching such poses. Our method, employing a novel user grasp metric, combines the operator's initial grasp guess given by a 3D spatial device with a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, thus returning reliable grasping poses but simultaneously close to the operator's initial guess. We compare this approach against commercial grasping pose definition interfaces through a user test involving 28 participants and against state-of-the-art deep learning grasp estimators. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in system usability (+24%) and a reduced workload (-16%). Furthermore, our experiments reveal an increased grasp success rate when utilizing the user grasp metric, surpassing state-of-the-art deep learning grasping estimators.",

This study developed a guide for assessing human performance using standard human factors measurement tools, and tested the sensitivity of those tools with two interface designs (i.e., gray and black) at three levels of workload (i.e., easy, medium, and difficult). The guide measures human performance through speed and accuracy, perceived workload using two standard instruments (i.e., NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT)), situation awareness through the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), and gaze through eye tracking coordinates. Twelve engineering student participants completed one simulation session at each of the three workload levels using one of two interface designs. Workload was manipulated through the number of simulated events (failures) in each session. Overall, the speed and accuracy measures, workload ratings, and eye tracking showed sensitivity to differences in workload level, and situation awareness showed sensitivity to the interaction between workload level and interface type. None of the tools were sensitive to interface type alone. Accuracy was highest under easy workload. Time per failure decreased at higher workload levels. Perceived workload ratings from the SWAT increased as workload increased, but workload ratings from the NASA-TLX were not different across workload levels. When workload increased, situation awareness remained steady for the gray interface but decreased sharply for the black interface, illustrating an interaction effect. Finally, the percentage of time spent looking at different areas of the screen during steady-state periods differed among workload levels. The tools in this guide can be used in the petrochemical industry to make design decisions for control room interfaces when workload levels are a concern.",

Mass Customisation requires more flexibility and adaptability capabilities in production systems. Matrix Production is a tact free job-shop like production system enabling variable production routing through a matrix shaped layout of partially redundant machines. Hence, it is one way to increase a production system’s flexibility and adaptability. A more powerful production control system comes hand in hand with the evolution towards a tact free Matrix Production System. However, the additional degree of freedom due to the flexibility not only touches production control, but also production planning, thus enabling the production of portfolio external products. Implementation of a Product Generation Module optimizes the workload of Matrix Production Systems to increase their efficiency by assessing the suitability of co-production of portfolio external products. Generation of suitable production orders increase machine utilization without impeding the original multi-dimensional production goals. Thus, reaching new production strategies that include the creation of value through effective manipulation of minor products and byproducts. The flexibility of Matrix Production Systems acts as the Product Generation Modules enabler, insofar as flexibility is the ability of a system to perform within an acceptable production corridor without layout and planning adjustments. This can be enhanced by making use of the Matrix Production Systems adaptability to increase the set of portfolio external products through layout and planning adjustments. Hence, this strategy leads to a continuous automated planning phase and additional revenue due to the additional manufacture of minor products within a Matrix Production System. Doing so allows the Matrix Production System to react towards external demand related and internal capacity related events without sacrificing precious value creation opportunities.",

This study investigated how urban spatial environments (residential district vs. commercial district; RD vs. CD) and lighting environments (daytime vs. nighttime) impact pedestrians' wayfinding behaviors in terms of time and space. Eye tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), and behavioural data from forty-three pedestrians were collected to compare their perceptual, decision-making, and task-execution processes in different environmental conditions. The study found that pedestrians in residential areas had lower spatial perception and attentional control, but higher decision speed and cognitive load compared to pedestrians in commercial areas during the perceptual decision-making phase. Pedestrians in daytime environments experience reduced spatial perception but increased cognitive load and enhanced attentional control compared to nighttime condition. In the task execution phase, the completion time was longer in the residential area compared to the commercial area.

Here, we demonstrate that increased cognitive load reduces the functional efficacy of a reward processing system within the human medial–frontal cortex. In our paradigm, two groups of participants used performance feedback to estimate the exact duration of one second while electroencephalographic (EEG) data was recorded. Prior to performing the time estimation task, both groups were instructed to keep their eyes still and avoid blinking in line with well established EEG protocol. However, during performance of the time-estimation task, one of the two groups was provided with trial-to-trial-feedback about their performance on the time-estimation task and their eye movements to induce a higher level of cognitive load relative to participants in the other group who were solely provided with feedback about the accuracy of their temporal estimates. In line with previous work, we found that the higher level of cognitive load reduced the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity, a component of the human event-related brain potential associated with reward evaluation within the medial–frontal cortex. Importantly, our results provide further support that increased cognitive load reduces the functional efficacy of a neural system associated with reward processing.",

The objective of the present study is to investigate the potential of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) – a non-invasive method of measuring prefrontal cortex activity – in combination with measurements of heart rate variability (HRV), to predict mental workload during a simulated piloting task, with particular regard to task engagement and disengagement. Twelve volunteers performed a computer-based piloting task in which they were asked to follow a dynamic target with their aircraft, a task designed to replicate key cognitive demands associated with real life ROV operating tasks. In order to cover a wide range of mental workload levels, task difficulty was manipulated in terms of processing load and difficulty of control – two critical sources of workload associated with piloting and remotely operating a vehicle. Results show that both fNIRS and HRV are sensitive to different levels of mental workload; notably, lower prefrontal activation as well as a lower LF/HF ratio at the highest level of difficulty, suggest that these measures are suitable for mental overload detection. Moreover, these latter measurements point toward the existence of a quadratic model of mental workload.",

BACKGROUND Every day we must decide whether to trust or distrust algorithms. Will an algorithm improve our performance on a task? What if we trust it too much? METHOD Participants had to pay to use the algorithm and were aware that it offered imperfect help. We varied the information about the algorithm to assess the factors that affected adoption while measuring participants’ peripheral neurophysiology. RESULTS We found that information about previous adoption by others had a larger effect on adoption and resulted in lower cognitive load than did information about algorithm accuracy. The neurophysiologic measurement showed that algorithm adoption without any information resulted in low cognitive engagement during the task and impaired task performance. Conversely, algorithm use after information about others’ use improved engagement and performance. CONCLUSION By objectively measuring cognitive load and task performance, we identified how to increase algorithm adoption while sustaining high performance by human operators. APPLICATION Algorithm adoption can be increased by sharing previous use information and performance improved by providing a reason to monitor the algorithm. Precis We collected neurophysiologic data while varying information about an algorithm that assisted participants in solving a timed and incentivized maze and found that information about prior use by others more effectively influenced adoption, reduced cognitive load, and improved performance compared to algorithm accuracy information.",

Several aspects of human cognition are critical to instructional design. First, the theory assumes we have not specifically evolved to learn the topics taught in educational and training institutions. Second, these topics require learners to acquire domain-specific rather than generic–cognitive knowledge. Third, while generic–cognitive knowledge does not require explicit instruction because we have evolved to acquire it, domain-specific concepts and skills do require explicit instruction. These factors interact with the capacity and duration constraints of working memory to delineate a cognitive architecture relevant to instructional design. The working memory limits do not apply to biologically primary, generic–cognitive knowledge acquired without explicit instruction but do apply to biologically secondary, domain-specific knowledge that requires explicit instruction. Accordingly, cognitive load theory has been developed to provide techniques that reduce unnecessary working memory load when dealing with explicitly taught, biologically secondary, domain-specific knowledge.",4

Still, it is often ineffective; impaired perceptions – such as low trust or limited understanding – reduce compliance with recommendations provided by the AI system. Drawing from cognitive load theory, we examine two techniques of human-AI collaboration as potential remedies. In three experimental studies, we grant users decision control by empowering them to adjust the system’s recommendations, and we offer explanations for the system’s reasoning. We find decision control positively affects user perceptions of trust and understanding, and improves user compliance with system recommendations. Next, we isolate different effects of providing explanations that may help explain inconsistent findings in recent literature: while explanations help reenact the system’s reasoning, they also increase task complexity. Further, the effectiveness of providing an explanation depends on the specific user’s cognitive ability to handle complex tasks. In summary, our study shows that users benefit from enhanced decision control, while explanations – unless appropriately designed for the specific user – may even harm user perceptions and compliance.

As a direct consequence, the embedded devices require retrieval and processing of data of large volume, which occupy large memory space in the embedded devices. Compression along with workload characterization is an effective technique for minimizing memory usage and to the improvement of endurance of memory in such devices. This paper investigates the embedded workload characterization using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) that is particularly suitable for large-scale datasets and real-time applications. Though ELM is single-layer feedforward network, its input weight randomization has a considerable effect on the accuracy of the classification. In this paper, the authors have proposed a hybrid algorithm for the optimization of the randomization of ELM. The Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO), the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Ant Colony Optimizer (ACO), and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) were used in the optimization of the classification process in ELM to increase the accuracy of the results. The input data must be categorized based on the energy consumed by each workload to proceed with further processing according to the system requirements.

The scrutiny of single pilot operations (SPO) approval from civil aviation authorities (CAAs) is subject to the aviation safety and pilot capability during exceptional handling and flight emergency. Airliners advocate the possibility from dual pilot operations (DPO) to SPO because of the financial considerations and captain shortage in the post-pandemic era. One could expect that SPO can only realise when reduced crew operations initiative is proven to be safe and airworthy. Public concerns pilot mental workload and potentially low situational awareness (SA) when handling overwhelmed multi-source information from the HMI in a cockpit, leading to degraded skills and flying performance. Advanced head up display (HUD) design, an integrated transparent display, can assist pilots in maintaining their optimal performance when SPO exercised. In this study, we are interested to design a SPO-favoured cockpit design with HUD and investigate the potential of integrating augmented reality (AR) and HUD in SPO in flight operations. An experiment involving 21 pilots was conducted to assess the effectiveness of AR-HUD on SA and workload in DPO, SPO, and SPO with AR-HUD scenarios. The Situation Awareness Present Assessment Method (SPAM) and a self-rated workload scale were used to evaluate SA and workload levels. Eye-tracking data was also collected to analyse behavioural performance. Results indicated that the AR-HUD scenario achieved optimal workload and SA levels and demonstrated superior performance in handling emergencies. Eye-tracking data revealed that AR-HUD facilitated a more equitable distribution of gaze between instruments and external view. In conclusion, the integration of AR in cockpit design introduces a human-centric interaction paradigm, contributing to aviation safety, SPO implementation and adaptive HMI design.",

The workload state of a workstation in the AMN is defined by three fuzzy membership functions: “under-normal-workload”, “normal-workload”, and “over-normal-workload”. Hence, the workload of a workstation is fuzzy multistate and the workstation-reliability is measured by three fuzzy membership functions. Subsequently, the system reliability is evaluated in terms of all workstation-reliabilities, and is derived by fuzzy intersection.

Research concerning integrated input-output control is very scarce. A novel approach is proposed: a closed-loop integrated model, where automatic feedback control is added and where order release and capacity decisions are a continuous function of the shop floor current state. In existing models, capacity increments are triggered by a threshold utilisation and have a fixed value, defined by means of experiments. In the proposed approach, these values are dynamically and flexibly defined (by the controller), addressing a gap regarding input-output parameterisation. The model was applied to a shop with unidirectional flow and three control rules were tested in scenarios of unbalanced work in process (WIP) and demand fluctuations. The results showed that the simultaneous input-output control is effective, leading the system to restore WIP balance, reach stability and absorb demand fluctuations, especially when global information is provided to the controller. The results of continuous closed-loop model simulation were integrated into a discrete-event simulation (DES) model, to compare the proposed capacity policies with the policies presented in the literature. The comparison showed that the proposed policies are cost-effective for a reasonable throughput time reduction. Moreover, the closed-loop model provided good parameters for a step-increment capacity policy that minimizes throughput times. Closed-loop control models are responsive and prescriptive, in contrast to DES models used in WLC research, which are descriptive. With this approach, WLC research can benefit from the strengths of both methods.",1

With two studies this explorative research investigated whether measures inherent to image interpretation, i.e. human-computer interaction and eye tracking, relate to cognitive load. Subsequently, it investigated effects of volumetric image interpretation on second-year medical students' cognitive load. Study 1 measured human-computer interactions of participants during two volumetric image interpretation tasks. Using structural equation modelling, the latent variable ‘volumetric image information’ was identified from the data, which significantly predicted self-reported mental effort as a measure of cognitive load. Study 2 measured participants' eye movements during multiple 2D and volumetric image interpretation tasks. Multilevel analysis showed that time to locate a relevant structure in an image was significantly related to pupil dilation, as a proxy for cognitive load. It is discussed how combining human-computer interaction and eye tracking allows for comprehensive measurement of cognitive load. Combining such measures in a single model would allow for disentangling unique sources of cognitive load, leading to recommendations for implementation of volumetric image interpretation in the medical education curriculum.",

This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners’ evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multi-criteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human–machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems.",

AR arrows combined with text-based instruction and a checklist provided assistance during practical learning. When learners made a mistake, an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) identified the source of the mistake and provided real-time feedback using text, AR and text-to-speech mechanisms. The design was motivated by the human-cognitive architecture and its five evolutionary principles (proposed by Sweller and Sweller (2006)). Users performed four consecutive network cabling training tasks with assistance from our ITS. We found that users made fewer errors when the AR cues, text-based instruction and checklist solutions were replaced with summarised information and then removed completely in the final task compared to those who used an identical system with fixed instruction. Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) explains our results by suggesting that the instructional mechanisms become redundant as knowledge increases. Implications of the study are discussed as well as how AR can help facilitate knowledge transfer in the network cabling domain.",

In particular, the balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I), demonstrated to play a role in animal studies, is difficult to measure in behaving humans. Here, we used functional magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy (1H-fMRS) to measure the brain's major inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (Glutamate) neurotransmitters during reinforcement learning with three different conditions: high cognitive load (uncertainty); probabilistic discrimination learning; and a control null-condition. Participants learned to prefer the gain option in the discrimination phase and had no preference in the other conditions. We found increased GABA levels during the uncertainty condition, potentially reflecting recruitment of inhibitory systems during high cognitive load when trying to learn. Further, higher GABA levels during the null (baseline) condition correlated with improved discrimination learning. Finally, glutamate and GABA levels were correlated during high cognitive load. These results suggest that availability of dACC inhibitory resources enables successful learning. Our approach helps elucidate the potential contribution of the balance between excitation and inhibition to learning and motivation in behaving humans.",

Websites are the important interfaces in HCI (Human–Computer Interaction). Website design significantly affects online shopping behavior. This research used eye-tracker to track the eye-movement process for 42 college students when they were surfing websites with different levels of complexity and completing simple and complex tasks respectively. The study examines how website complexity and task complexity jointly affect users' visual attention and behavior due to different cognitive loads. The study fills a research gap by examining this phenomenon from the cognitive load perspective and taking the moderate effect of task complexity into consideration. The results show that task complexity can moderate the effect of website complexity on users' visual attention and behavior. Specifically, when users conducted a simple task, fixation count and task completion time were at the highest level on the website with high complexity, while fixation duration was not significantly different on the websites with different complexity. However, when users conducted a complex task on a website with medium complexity, task completion time, fixation count, and fixation duration were all at their highest level. The load theory of attention was used to provide the explanation for the results. The findings provide guidelines for website managers and designers to maximize users' visual attention.",

Prolonged monitoring or sustained attention has been found to be stressful for human operators. Plant and process operators have also been found to have one of the highest level of work demands (work speed, pace) in a recent European survey (Eurofound, 2015). Along with this, the incidence of Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs) remains at a high level in the manufacturing sector. This research endeavoured to determine if end-tidal CO2 levels decreased and upper trapezius muscle activity increased concurrently with increased levels of attention. We then developed a model to investigate if end-tidal CO2 moderated the relationship between mental workload due to sustained attention and upper trapezius muscle activity. The resulting interactional model found that end-tidal CO2 moderated the relationship (p = 0.004) when end-tidal CO2 reached the hypocapnic range (>35 mm Hg). This model indicates the possibility that a high level of sustained attention is a risk factor in the development of WRMSDs and should therefore be included in workplace risk assessments.",

Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios. This is achieved by providing the middleware interoperability, determinism, and automatic data structuring over an industrial communication infrastructure such as the OPC UA Standard over Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). Cloud services and database warehousing used to address some of the challenges are handled using fog computing and a multi-workload database.

Background Learning about subjective workload is important for assessing the impact of a pilot's work environment on their performance in the cockpit. This is an important element of flight safety and includes the prevention of aviation accidents. Methods The study included 146 military pilots that fly the following aircrafts: flying fast-jet (21), fixed-wing (24), and rotary-wing (101). The NASA-TLX questionnaire was used to assess workload and pilots were asked to determine the level of workload resulting from flying under the following conditions: daytime flight (VFR), night-vision flight performed under Night Visual Flight Rules (NVFR), and night-vision flight using night-vision goggles (NVGs). Results The highest level of workload was consistently attributed to flights performed under NVG conditions. NVFR conditions were rated as the most burdensome, while VFR conditions were rated as the least burdensome. Fast-jet pilots rated their mental performance and effort workload as significantly higher than pilots of other aircrafts. Conclusion Pilots’ perceived workload is influenced by both flight conditions and the type of aircraft they fly. Workload knowledge is important for flight safety and should be taken into account during training and flight-task planning. Application The results of our study can be useful both in flight training and in work on the effectiveness of the human-machine interface. Awareness of one's own limitations due to the work environment can help improve flight safety.",

However, the nature of cognitive network alterations associated with chronic pain and their underlying mechanisms require elucidation. Here, we report that the claustrum, a subcortical nucleus implicated in cognitive network modulation, is activated by acute painful stimulation and pain-predictive cues in healthy participants. Moreover, we discover pathological activity of the claustrum and a region near the posterior inferior frontal sulcus of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (piDLPFC) in migraine patients during acute pain and cognitive task performance. Dynamic causal modeling suggests a directional influence of the claustrum on activity in this piDLPFC region, and diffusion weighted imaging verifies their structural connectivity. These findings advance understanding of claustrum function during acute pain and provide evidence of a possible circuit mechanism driving cognitive impairments in chronic pain.",9

Three hundred and thirty-four university students interacted with a purpose-built application that presented ancient Greek inventions through the use of head-mounted displays. Data analysis, adhering to a structural equation modeling approach, indicated that a multitude of factors exerted a positive influence on learning outcomes.

Moreover, while the routes must ensure that drivers’ workload is time balanced and contract regulations can be met, they also must correspond to a customers’ partition (sectorization) according to well-defined, non-overlapping delivery areas. We introduce an approach to solve the problem through the algorithm HSAC (Hierarchical Simulated Annealing Clustering). The proposed algorithm first applies a divisive approach to the data, using simulated annealing at each step to create time-balanced partitions, and then solves the TSP problem to create optimal routes within the defined groups.

In this paper we try to analyze these relationships between task performance, workload, and situation awareness. We explored the results of both self-rated, observer-rated, and objective measures. We explored the relations between and within measures, as well as the trends across the different assessments, affected by control room modifications. The results indicate a similar pattern in workload and situation awareness measures through evaluations; that the relations within self-rated measures appear to be clearer than between self-rated and observer-rated measures; and that there seems to be a trend for improved task performance results in the control room throughout the years.",

The electromyographic (EMG) activity data from six muscle sites of the neck and the dominant side of the shoulder and arm were recorded. Muscle fatigue was assessed using normalized root-mean-square (RMS) of EMG data and the slopes of median frequency (MF) and mean power frequency (MPF). The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was utilized as a secondary subjective measure for perceived workload. Findings Compared to the simple task, performance of the complex task was associated with significantly higher values of RMS EMG (29.92% in average) for all sampled muscles. The slopes of MF and MPF for the flexor carpi radialis muscle during the complex task were significantly lower than that of the simple task. Also, TLX scores for the complex task were significantly higher than those for the simple task. Conclusions Findings of this study indicate that, within the sampled muscles, the complexity of the maintenance task could cause more muscle fatigue, especially for the forearm muscle. The results of the TLX scores suggest that task complexity could contribute to a significant increase in mental, physical, and temporal demands, effort, and frustration. Relevance to industry The findings of this study could be utilized to improve the designs of industrial maintenance tasks with respect to human ability and performance.",

What is the contribution of early experience? We review insights into these questions from visual cortex function in people born blind. In blindness, occipital cortices are active during auditory and tactile tasks. What ‘cross-modal’ plasticity tells us about cortical flexibility is debated. On the one hand, visual networks of blind people respond to higher cognitive information, such as sentence grammar, suggesting drastic repurposing. On the other, in line with ‘metamodal’ accounts, sighted and blind populations show shared domain preferences in ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC), suggesting visual areas switch input modality but perform the same or similar perceptual functions (e.g., face recognition) in blindness. Here we bring these disparate literatures together, reviewing and synthesizing evidence that speaks to whether visual cortices have similar or different functions in blind and sighted people. Together, the evidence suggests that in blindness, visual cortices are incorporated into higher-cognitive (e.g., fronto-parietal) networks, which are a major source long-range input to the visual system. We propose the connectivity-constrained experience-dependent account. Functional development is constrained by innate anatomical connectivity, experience and behavioral needs. Infant cortex is pluripotent, the same anatomical constraints develop into different functional outcomes.",

In this study, we evaluated the relevance of a headphone- mounted electroencephalogram (EEG) system for monitoring mental workload. The participants (N = 12) were instructed to pay attention to auditory alarms presented sporadically while performing the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) whose difficulty was staged across three conditions to manipulate mental workload. The P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP) elicited by the presentation of auditory alarms were used as probes of attentional resources available. The amplitude and latency of P300 ERPs were compared across experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that the P300 ERP component can be captured using a headphone-mounted EEG system. Moreover, neural responses to alarm could be used to classify mental workload with high accuracy (over 80%) at a single-trial level. Our analyses indicated that the signal-to-noise ratio acquired by the sponge-based sensors remained stable throughout the recordings. These results highlight the potential of portable neuroimaging technology for the development of neuroassistive applications while underscoring the current limitations and challenges associated with the integration of EEG sensors in everyday-life wearable technologies. Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of research exploring the feasibility and validity of wearable neuroimaging technologies for the study of human cognition and behavior in real-world settings.",

There are two main goals for this study. First, we examine the use of wearable sensors to detect physical fatigue occurrence in simulated manufacturing tasks. The second goal is to estimate the physical fatigue level over time. In order to achieve these goals, sensory data were recorded for eight healthy participants. Penalized logistic and multiple linear regression models were used for physical fatigue detection and level estimation, respectively. Important features from the five sensors locations were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), a popular variable selection methodology. The results show that the LASSO model performed well for both physical fatigue detection and modeling. The modeling approach is not participant and/or workload regime specific and thus can be adopted for other applications.",

A laboratory study was conducted with four levels of mental workload, ranging from none to high and during sitting and stepping activities. When sitting, a difference in the heart rate and motion data from the smartwatch was only found between no mental workload and any mental workload task. For the stepping condition, differences were found for the movement data. Based on these results, wearable devices could be useful in the future for detecting whether a mental demanding task is currently performed during low levels of physical activity.",

Responses to tasks that are perceived as mentally demanding can exacerbate ergonomics risk factors affecting employee behavior and attitude, leading to risky actions such as awkward body postures, and consequently increasing physiological susceptibility to work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The present study looked to establish if the perception of mental workload can be affected by psychosocial work factors that generate changes in the environment in which humans must perform the tasks. The study also looked to determine if changes in perceived mental workload generated changes in the body postures undertaken to perform an activity to lay the foundation for future exploration into the influence of perceived mental workload over physical demands.

This study is novel and contributes to overcoming an important shortcoming in the field of mental workload by considering the influence of psychosocial factors, keeping the physical load constant, on the perception of mental workload and its influence on body postures. This interaction between perceived mental workload and its effects on physical risk should be considered in occupational settings since often, employees are exposed to concurrent physical and mental demands that increase the likelihood of developing WMSDs.",

The goal was to reduce the workload while also maintaining the transparency and objectivity of the selection process. The algorithms were trained, validated, and tested on a set of 3187 studies on simulation-based learning found in medical and educational databases collected before April 2018. Subsequently, they were utilized to classify abstracts for a follow-up meta-analysis consisting of 2373 studies (published between 2018 and 2020). The aim of training the algorithms was to predict studies’ abstract eligibility based on words and combinations of words used in these abstracts. The application of the algorithms reduced the number of studies that had to be manually screened from 2373 to 711. A total of 458 studies from automatically selected abstracts were included in the full-text screening, indicating the high precision of the algorithms (also compared to the performance of human raters).

However, these studies mostly focused on system efficiency and ignored ergonomic aspects. Order picking was confirmed as a labor-intensive process in an environment in which workers are at a high risk of developing health problems. Therefore, this study addresses the investigation of physical human working conditions in both manual and robot-assisted order picking systems via real-life laboratory experiments and simulation modeling. We used a motion capture system to assess human working postures when working with and without robot assistance. In addition, we estimated the daily workload by applying the energy expenditure concept. Using simulation experiments, we were able to extend the results to various practical scenarios with different design variables, for example warehouse layouts, order sizes, and human-robot team configuration. Our preliminary results reveal that human-robot collaboration can reduce human workload. Posture evaluation also shows a slight improvement.",19

Human factors are incorporated into the proposed model in terms of human reliability and decision-making processes. Three objective functions are considered simultaneously. The first objective minimizes the total cost of the MDCMS. The second objective function minimizes inconsistency in the decision-making style of operators in the common manufacturing cells. The third objective function balances the workload of cells with respect to the efficiency of operators, which is calculated based on human reliability analysis. Various studies have been conducted in the field of MDCMS, but human factors have not received sufficient attention as important elements. Due to the NP-hardness of the MDCMS problem, two innovative meta-heuristic algorithms are developed, i.e., a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method.

Inappropriate collaborative behaviors will result in a poor perceptual experience for human operators (e.g., robots starting action too early or too late). To address this issue, a fusion-based spiking neural networks (FSNNs) approach for collaboration request prediction is proposed, aiming to find the right collaboration timing for robots in HRC assembly system and to minimize human aversion without affecting human operation behaviors. By encoding human behavior, product state and robot pose into spiking signals that can be processed by FSNNs, the spatio-temporal coupling relationship between those three aspects can be comprehensively analyzed, and to solve the appropriate timing of robot participation in collaboration. Finally, demonstrative experiments are carried out on the HRC assembly of generator end caps in the lab environment.

In this study, we compared the functional architecture of the DMN between humans and marmosets to assess their similarities and differences using joint gradients. This approach permits simultaneous large-scale mapping of functional systems across the cortex of humans and marmosets, revealing evidence of putative homologies between them. In doing so, we find that the DMN architecture of the marmoset exhibits differences along its anterolateral-posterior axis. Specifically, the anterolateral node of the DMN (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) displayed weak connections and inconsistent connection topographies as compared to its posterior DMN-nodes (posterior cingulate and posterior parietal cortices). We also present evidence that the marmoset medial prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe areas correspond to other macroscopical distributed functional systems that are not part of the DMN. Given the importance of the marmoset as a pre-clinical primate model for higher-order cognitive functioning and the DMN's relevance to cognition, our results suggest that the marmoset may lack the capacity to integrate neural information to subserve cortical dynamics that are necessary for supporting diverse cognitive demands.",

Recent findings suggest that persistent neural firing in the hippocampus during maintenance in verbal working memory is associated with workload. Here, we recorded single neuron firing in 13 epilepsy patients (7 male) while they performed a visual working memory task. The number of colored squares in the stimulus set determined the workload of the trial. Performance was almost perfect for low workload (1 and 2 squares) and dropped at high workload (4 and 6 squares), suggesting that high workload exceeded working memory capacity. We identified maintenance neurons in MTL neurons that showed persistent firing during the maintenance period. More maintenance neurons were found in the hippocampus for trials with correct compared to incorrect performance. Maintenance neurons increased and decreased firing in the hippocampus and increased firing in the entorhinal cortex for high compared to low workload. Population firing predicted workload particularly during the maintenance period. Prediction accuracy of workload based on single-trial activity during maintenance was strongest for neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The data suggest that persistent neural firing in the MTL reflects a domain-general process of maintenance supporting performance and workload of multiple items in working memory below and beyond working memory capacity. Persistent neural firing during maintenance in the entorhinal cortex may be associated with its preference to process visual-spatial arrays.",

In order to distribute the workload evenly over all the workers in the line, some of the industries resorted to the practice of rotating all the workers through all workstations in the cell (Nagare cell) that prevents monotony and boredom. The presence of automated equipment in the cell will hamper this strategy for job rotation. This study aims to demonstrate the application of ergonomically designed looping layout in the assembly cell in the labor demanded lean manufacturing environment. The study was conducted in a process line in an automobile ancillary unit. The current process line which was conventional U-shaped line was simulated and the productivity has been verified and validated with the real life environment. Process map showed that the operators walked long distances, felt stress in certain workstations and that inventory piled up at the bottleneck workstation. We identify sub-cells within the cell. With the same manpower, we develop a new layout (Suzhal) and make workers rotate within each sub-cell. The proposed layout was simulated and results have been compared with the current layout. The analysis shows a reduction in the total operating cycle time, higher alertness among operators, better distribution of workloads in the group and hence higher productivity.",

It leads to more predictable throughput times and more accurate delivery date promising. In this paper, we propose a representation of the workload control principles by means of a dynamic model based on bond graphs, and present the modeling of this system. According to the bond graph methodology, the manufacturing entities can be associated to constitutive equations, which can be combined to generate a state model. The presented state model provides informations about instantaneous levels of work in process of the system, and can show the effect of release policies (input control) and capacity adjustments (output control) into these levels of work in process. Exploratory simulations were carried out in Simulink. The existing simulation of WLC systems usually employs open-loop descriptive models based on discrete events simulation, and the parameters of input and output control are empirically/experimentally defined. A gap was identified in the literature, specially concerning the parameter setting for output control. In the proposed model, input and output control are performed automatically, by the controllers implemented to the dynamic model (closed-loop system). Therefore, the proposed approach can bring prescriptive directions to the parameter setting of WLC, and we believe it can also bring future comparative insights to the existing simulations of this methodology.",2

Participants performed a visual search task in the physical environment while a nearby collaborative robot repeatedly extended its arm toward them. This scenario was reconstructed in two virtual environments with different levels of graphical detail. Measures of presence, task performance, workload, and anxiety were taken to determine the effect of robot motion in all three environments. Task performance decreased in response to robot motion in the physical environment, while workload and anxiety increased. This simple effect of motion was consistent across environments for measures of task performance and anxiety. However, people performed faster overall in virtual reality, and the effect of motion on workload was greatly reduced in virtual reality. Results in the virtual environments suggest that people were distracted by the sound of the robot, and that presence was affected by manipulations of immersion and coherence.",

This analysis draws from a five-week Algebra intervention for middle school students (n=46) designed to promote agency through collaborative mathematical activity. Typically, students identified as underperforming (as most in this intervention were), teachers revert to procedural, low-level instruction. In contrast, this intervention was designed around tasks of high cognitive demand that required visual or symbolic representation of algebraic concepts. Qualitative coding of student interviews (n=46) confirm the design principles of authority, agency and collaboration were positively impactful for students. In particular, interviews evidence a changing perspective from math as boring to the possibility of math as comingling intellectual challenge and personal enjoyment. These results are traced to the design principles and in particular, the focus on organizing for agency.",

This can lead to undesirable outcomes for contractors, thus referred to as unilateral contractual change risk (UCCR) in this study. As such, identifying UCCR proactively becomes essential for contractors, particularly in engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) projects where the claim scope is limited. Although natural language processing (NLP) has shown promise in the identification of UCCR, it faces difficulties due to the high cognitive demands required. To fill the gap, we propose a rational-augmented NLP framework that emulates human reasoning to identify UCCR in EPC contracts in an explainable and effective manner. The framework (1) leverages NLP techniques to disassemble contract text into features that draw the attention of human readers for obligation-related comprehension, and (2) generates a coherent sequence of intermediate reasoning steps using a customized Microsoft Excel and-in interface to identify predetermined categories of UCCR. Our framework, which achieves an outstanding F1 score of 0.87, is trained on a widely used standard form of EPC contract. It also presents a user-friendly interface for contractors to discern any intentional or malicious acts committed by the owner during the contract stage. Furthermore, our methodology can be adapted to enhance risk management in other sectors.",

We worry that communications across cortical regions will be impeded when humans in extreme space environments travel with mental load work, affecting the successful completion of missions. Here, we monitored crews of workers performing a Go/Nogo task in space travel, accompanied by acquisitions of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. These data demonstrated that when the target stimulus suddenly changed to the non-target stimulus, an instantaneous communication mechanism between the frontal and occipital cortex was established by theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). However, this frontal-occipital communication was impeded because of the mental workload of space travel. 86 healthy volunteers who participated in the ground imitation further indicated that mental workload caused decoupled theta-gamma PAC during the Go/Nogo task, impeding frontal-occipital communications and behavioral performance. We also found that the degree of theta-gamma PAC coupling in space was significantly lower than on the ground, indicating that mental workload and other hazards worsen the impeded frontal-occipital communications of humans. These results could guide countermeasures for the inadaptability of humans working in spaceflight.",

Higher throughput systems allow PBF systems to be considered for a larger variety of industrial applications. However, the inclusion of multiple heat sources, or beams, also increases the complexity of the control schemes needed. For multi-beam systems with overlapping fields of view, the distribution of workload, or load balancing, across these beams directly affects the total print time for a build. Additionally, the probability of any beam failing in a multi-beam system increases with the number of beams. While manual methods of load balancing and dealing with beam failures are reasonable for current generation multi-beam systems, as system configurations become more complex, manual methods will become prohibitively inefficient. This paper introduces two different ways to load balance multi-beam systems of various configuration types, regardless of their complexity, which are highly performant. A consequence of this performance is the enablement of on-the-fly load balancing in the event a beam fails, thus improving system robustness.",

The present study aims to advance learning engagement research by examining an often neglected subcomponent of behavioral engagement, attrition. Implementing two equivalent versions of a learning task, differing solely in the presence of game elements, allowed unequivocal attribution of any effect on the presence of game elements. Conducting the study in an online learning environment allowed further a highly unconstrained examination of the effects of game elements on attrition. We found that game elements affected both participant attrition and engagement of participants who completed the learning task. Participants with low self-efficacy were particularly prone to drop out in the non-game condition. Game elements also affected both learning efficacy and efficiency. We further found task attractivity to partially mediate the effect of game elements on learning outcomes. The results suggest that by facilitating engagement via task attractivity game elements can compensate to some extent for the increased cognitive demand that the game elements induce. We finally discuss the importance of considering the interrelations between learner characteristics, game elements, and engagement for interpreting results on learning performance measures.",

Every process and operation must be designed in the best possible way to ensure that the overall process chain leads to the right product quality. During the last two decades a shift from inspection of manufactured products to a more holistic approach with quality assurance as an integrated activity throughout the product realization process has emerged in manufacturing industry. The importance of the principles addressed in the methods and tools used in automotive industry for quality management is indisputable. However, the tasks of creating and managing documents for Process Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (PFMEA), Control plans, Initial process studies and Measurement System Analysis (MSA) results in high workload. Also, lack of interoperability between different computer applications used in process planning and quality assurance results in information fragmentation, data duplication and potential data inconsistency. This paper proposes a novel, model driven approach for process planning integrating quality assurance which emphasizes the application of digital models to create, represent and use information of products, processes and resources. By reducing the amount of data and document duplication, the presented model driven approach has potential to radically increase the direct value adding part of manufacturing engineer's daily work also contributing to achieve a more holistic view in interdisciplinary work between different experts in product realization.",

Working procedures were characterised using a work-study method, environmental conditions were recorded and a biomechanical analysis of the inspected task was conducted. An innovative measuring system was developed that enables synchronisation and analysis of the manufacturing, biomechanics, workload and environmental data.

Another experiment was conducted to test the effect of three different trellising angles (30°, 60°, 90°) on labour and yield in tomato. The results revealed that in tomato, in comparison to current methods, picking 4 fruit per cycle will increase production rate by 17%, leaf removal from the fruit area will increase production rate by 14.4%—up to 40.2%—and the best trellising angle with respect to yield and labour will be 30°.

Within an immersive mixed-reality environment simulating an electrical construction task, this study employed ensemble modeling to classify workers' mental load via their fNIRS-captured brain activation. Beyond identifying the prefrontal and motor cortices as the most important brain areas contributing to ML-driven mental load classifications when using fNIRS, this paper also proposes a mental load classification methodology that synthesizes neuroimaging data with individuals' risk-propensity scores to address the limitations of existing personalized and generalized ML models. The results reveal better performance for fNIRS-based mental load classifications given participants' personal risk propensity (risk-seeker and risk-averse). This research, therefore, (1) offers valuable insights into the importance of identifying at-risk workers who are more likely to experience impaired cognitive processing and situational awareness due to increased mental load, and (2) sheds light on reliable pipelines for developing fNIRS-based mental load classification.",

In order to reduce the delay and the resulting negative impact, the appropriate and reasonable overtime work is an effective and commonly used approach. However, if the overtime work is used unreasonably, not only cannot it increase the production speed but also may lead to higher manufacturing costs. In order to use overtime work optimally, a multi-objective job shop scheduling problem with overtime work consideration (MOJSSP/O) is proposed to minimize total tardiness and overtime costs. An enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ENSGA-Ⅱ) is developed to address the problem. To accelerate the convergence, a problem-specific two-stage decoding scheme is designed. An adaptive mechanism is applied to keep the stability of global convergence and a local search procedure is adopted to enhance the exploitation ability. Experiments on 38 modified JSSP benchmarks are provided to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Computational results validate the effectiveness of the presented improvements, and show that the proposed ENSGA-Ⅱ outperforms the other well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on all test instances.",

Two alternative HMI designs were elaborated in order to separately evaluate the ergonomic impacts of the head-up display and the coordinated control by comparing them to the standard HMI design. The effectiveness of these three HMI designs in terms of the reduction of the operators' mental and physical workload were assessed by conducting experiments utilizing human subjects, ages 23–35 years. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Task Load Index (NASA TLX) method was used for collecting subjective workload scores based on a weighted average of ratings of six factors: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Own Performance, Effort, and Frustration Level. The results showed that the type of HMI design affects different aspects of the operator's workload. Indeed, it showed how the proposed augmented interaction is an effective solution for reducing the ergonomic gaps in terms of mental workload, and to a lesser extent the physical workload, subjected by the standard HMI design.

Here, we used a perceptual decision-making task with conditions of high cognitive load to challenge the CCN and to assess the CCC in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. We found that the activation of the right anterior insular cortex (AIC) of the CCN increased monotonically as a function of cognitive load, reached its plateau early, and showed a significant correlation to the CCC. In a subsequent study of patients with unilateral lesions of the AIC, we found that lesions of the AIC were associated with a significant impairment of the CCC. Simulated lesions of the AIC resulted in a reduction of the global efficiency of the CCN in a network analysis.

Interaction effects were also found for primary tasks and two of the secondary tasks. This study has contributed to the knowledge of UAS operation, and the factors which may influence performance and workload within the UAS operator. Performance and workload effects were shown to be elicited by time pressure.

To do so, we perform an assessment across two dimensions: operators’ (i) performance and (ii) arousal level. We contribute to the literature on endogenous processing times and highlight the importance of considering behavioral aspects when companies define an implementation strategy and when conducting WLC studies. Furthermore, given that production systems are operated by people, our results show that behavioral effects need to be considered in the specification of workload norms. Based on our results, we conclude that operators exhibit substantial heterogeneity in their reaction behavior, depending on their positioning in a flow shop (gateway station vs. downstream station).",

We experimentally compared the effectiveness of two digital concepts for displaying and analysing periscope imagery during a simulated submarine mission. OPTIX modelled a traditional periscope by presenting a narrow (20° horizontal arc) rotating image of the horizon. OPTIMUS displayed the full 360° panoramic representation of the horizon and was augmented with digital analysis tools. OPTIMUS supported faster and more accurate performance by participants (N = 32) and lowered perceived workload, compared to when the same participants used OPTIX. However, time taken to respond to situation awareness queries and awareness of one’s own performance (meta-awareness) was poorer when using OPTIMUS. OPTIMUS holds an advantage in that it can improve performance whilst reducing workload, but the SA and meta-awareness decrements are potentially problematic.",

When both imagery and analysis tools were shared, perceived workload increased and tactical picture compilation was more accurate. Despite this improved tactical picture for the imagery and analysis tools condition, there was no advantage to mission completion (rendezvous/close contact detection) or situation awareness. In contrast to the increased subjective workload, individuals in teams provided with shared imagery (with or without tools) had a lower physiological response (heart rate, electrodermal) to task demands compared to the baseline condition. Sharing imagery and analysis tools likely benefited tactical picture compilation by enabling dynamic task redistribution and multiple streams of concurrent data analysis.",

A large part of the accessibility systems, for the public, are not designed to consider the usage of the blind, which can lead to exclusion. The majority of them must rely on other senses for space location awareness, an example that is followed frequently is the creation of mental maps for certain already-known places. Using the means of transportation, which is a necessary activity for a blind person but uncomplicated for a sighted person, may require studying every move the driver makes in order to accurately determine the present path. Crowdsourcing systems offer the potential to develop a social network through which some of the issues faced by blind people may be resolved. Over time, this leads to the development of a community that fully comprehends the issues and requirements that visually impaired people (VIPs) encounter on a daily basis. With the use of multi-modal feedback interfaces, this effort intends to demonstrate a collaborative system that pairs volunteers with blind persons and guides them along a route.

However, it is important that users appropriately trust and rely on aids. Decision aids can be presented in many ways, but the literature lacks clarity over the conditions surrounding their effectiveness. This research aims to determine whether a numerical or graphical aid more effectively supports human performance, and explores the relationships between aid presentation, trust, and workload. Participants (N = 30) completed a signal-identification task that required integration of readings from a set of three dynamic gauges. Participants experienced three conditions: unaided, using a numerical aid, and using a graphical aid. The aids combined gauge and base-rate information in a statistically-optimal fashion. Participants also indicated how much they trusted the system and how hard they worked during the task. Analyses explored the impact of aid condition on sensitivity, response bias, response time, trust, and workload. Both the numerical and graphical aids produced significant increases in sensitivity and trust, and significant decreases in workload in comparison to the unaided condition. The difference in response time between the graphical and unaided conditions approached significance, with participants responding faster using the graphical aid without decrements in sensitivity. Significant interactions between aid and signal type indicated that both aided conditions promoted faster responding to non-hostile signals, with larger mean differences in the graphical aid condition. Practically, graphical aids in which suggestions are more salient to users may promote faster responding in tactical environments, with negligible cost of accuracy.",

To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the effects of acute stress on behavioural and electrophysiological measures of human attentional networks, and behavioural measures of working memory. Forty-five female participants (Mage = 22.1, SD = 2.4) performed the Attention Network Test (ANT) and the n-back task before and after the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST; n = 23) or a non-stressful MAST-placebo (n = 22). Subjective distress ratings and salivary cortisol concentrations revealed a successful stress induction. Increased salivary cortisol at baseline was associated with slower reaction times across both tasks, suggesting a general detrimental effect of cortisol on cognitive functioning. Despite these findings, however, the hypothesised effects of the acute stress manipulation were not found for either task. Supplementary analyses indicated that these results were unrelated to the magnitude or duration of the stress response. Our results therefore suggest the standard version of the ANT may be insensitive to the effects of acute stress, and that higher cognitive loads may be necessary to observe stress effects on the n-back task.",

This was explored with an experimental setup at the site of an industrial company, where various representative picking operators were observed while emptying flat and tilted pallets. The observation was video recorded and subjected to a time study and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). Results showed that there are differences in picking time and physical workload depending on where in the pallet the picking action takes place, and that flat and tilted pallets bring different postural opportunities and challenges for different operator percentiles in the working population. An overview of postural ergonomics consequences and their associated risk levels are shown, and the results serve to further increase the understanding of which factors are affected by choosing between a tilted or flat component presentation. This understanding is highly relevant to industry, where it can contribute to the design of both efficient and ergonomically sound processes for manual picking operations.",

Consequently, mental status estimation has gained considerable research attention due to its potential benefits. Among the various signals used to assess mental state, the electroencephalogram, with its wealth of brain-related information, is widely employed by researchers. In this paper, we categorize mental workload into three states (low, middle, and high) and estimate a continuum of mental workload levels. Our method leverages information from multiple spatial dimensions (time and frequency domain) to achieve optimal results. In our approach, focusing on the time domain, we utilize Temporal Convolutional Networks to capture temporal information. Meanwhile, in the frequency domain, we implement two distinct branches aimed at acquiring varied information regarding Power Spectral Density by utilizing different lengths of the Fast Fourier Transform. Each branch consists of two blocks, known as the Multi-Dimensional Residual Block, representing a novel architecture by combining residual blocks. The integration of these two domains yields significant results compared to individual estimates in each domain. Our approach achieved a 74.98% accuracy in the three-class classification, surpassing the provided data results at 69.00%. Specially, our method demonstrates efficacy in estimating continuous levels, evidenced by a corresponding Concordance Correlation Coefficient result of 0.629.

Post-error processing is reflected in neural signatures such as reduced activity in sensorimotor regions and increased activity in medial prefrontal cortex. PES is thought to reflect the deployment of executive resources to get task performance back on track. This provides a general account of PES that cuts across perceptual decision-making, memory, and learning tasks. With respect to PES and learning, things are complicated by the fact that learning often reflectsmultiple qualitatively different processes with distinct neural correlates. It is unclear if multiple processes shape PES during learning, or if PES reflects a policy for reacting to errors generated by one particular process (e.g., cortico-striatal reinforcement learning). Here we provide behavioral and computational evidence that PES is influenced by the operation of multiple distinct processes. Human subjects learned a simple visuomotor skill (arbitrary visuomotor association learning) under low load conditionsmore amenable to simple working memory-based strategies, and high load conditions that were putatively more reliant on trial-by-trial reinforcement learning. PES decreased withload, even when the progress of learning (i.e., reinforcement history) was accounted for. This result suggested that PES during learning is influenced by the recruitment of working memory. Indeed, observed PES effects were approximated by a computational model with parallel working memory and reinforcement learning systems that are differentially recruited according to cognitive load.",

The critical planning decisions involve finding the optimal number of robots in the warehouse, the expected number of robots at essential locations of the warehouse, and performance analysis of the order picking system. A distinctive feature of this study is the conceptualization of a human factor called perceived workload (which depends on the number of robots) in the order picking planning model for efficient order fulfillment. Our analyses interestingly suggest that deploying more robots in warehouses with a parts-to-picker system does not necessarily increase the warehousing system’s performance; instead, a trade-off exists. Additionally, the workload-dependent service rate significantly influences the robots queueing in front of the order picking station (internal queue) and the synchronization station (external queue) in the warehouse. More importantly, this work contributes to the design of a human-centric work environment for parts-to-picker order fulfillment system.",

Previous research has revealed that the psychological and emotional conditions of workers can contribute to fatalities and injuries. Recent observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest that inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, laborers are vulnerable to unexpected hazards while focusing on complicated construction tasks. Therefore, the ability to detect the mental conditions of workers could reduce unexpected injuries. However, there are currently no available measurement approaches or devices capable of monitoring construction workers' mental conditions.

The concrete functioned places and transitions, were proposed to structure a human resource allocation and recovery processes in TPN. The characteristics of operator are interpreted as initial markings of places and delay of transitions.

The evaluation indexes of the disassembly line include the number of workstations, workload smoothness, and disassembly profits. A new genetic simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to optimize the model. The encoding and decoding strategies are constructed according to the characteristics of partial disassembly and parallel layout.

Such analyses often ignore that the arms, legs, and body trunk movements all have significant roles during walking; in other words, these body nodes with accelerometers form a body sensor network (BSN). BSN refers to a network of wearable sensors or devices on the human body that collects physiological signals. Our study proposes that human locomotion could be considered as a network of well-connected nodes. Methods While hypothesizing that accelerometer data can model this BSN, we collected accelerometer signals from six body areas from ten healthy participants performing a cognitive task. Machine learning based on genetic programming was used to produce a collection of non-linear symbolic models of human locomotion. Results With implications in precision medicine, our primary finding was that our BSN models fit the data from the lower back's accelerometer and describe subject-specific data the best compared to all other models. Across subjects, models were less effective due to the diversity of human sizes. Conclusions A BSN relationship between all six body nodes has been shown to describe the subject-specific data, which indicates that the network-medicine relationship between these nodes is essential in adequately describing human walking. Our gait analyses can be used for several clinical applications such as medical diagnostics as well as creating a baseline for healthy walking with and without a cognitive load.",

Specifically, a visual-based telepresence augmentation method is proposed to provide the operator with virtual-reality combined visual telepresence, where the real point cloud model is directly superimposed on virtual manipulator to avoid the time-consuming process of mesh model rendering. With the utilization of visual information, a haptic-based telepresence augmentation method is proposed to provide the operator with comprehensive force feedback, including the virtual guiding force, virtual repulsive force and real-time interactive force, which greatly helps reduce the workload of operator. Finally, a user study on grab-place task is carried out to verify the effectiveness of proposed system.",

It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.",

At the same time results of an in-line quality inspections are shown which can be interactively modified through human gestures. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) in contrast to other industrial augmented reality applications the described one technically builds upon a deep neural net based pose estimation.

However, this collaborative paradigm requires continuous attention from human operators, which could potentially strain their cognitive resources. Excessive attention demands can lead to safety hazards, increased errors, and reduced efficiency. Despite its critical importance, there is limited empirical research on attentional factors in industrial human-robot collaboration. In this study, we explore attentional multitasking in collaborative human-robot assembly settings. Our experimental setup involves participants performing a wire harnessing task with a collaborative robot while simultaneously completing a Go/No-Go test as a secondary task. To observe the effect of multitasking, we varied the difficulty of the secondary task across two levels and analysed its impacts on work performance and workload. Our results confirm threaded cognition theory, suggesting that human-robot collaboration could reduce cognitive capacity by depleting attentional resources, leading to higher errors and cycle times during multitasking. This underscores the importance of a detailed understanding of attentional factors in human-robot collaboration. We discuss our findings and their implications, and provide insights into the adjustment and design of human-robot collaboration tasks in the industry.",19

This thought activity is suggested to be underpinned by a distributed set of regions in the brain, referred to as the default network. To date, experimental assessment of mind wandering has typically taken place during performance of a concurrent attention-demanding task. The attentional demands of concurrent tasks can influence the emergence of mind wandering, and their application to clinical disorders with reduced cognitive resources is limited. Furthermore, few paradigms have investigated the phenomenological content of mind wandering episodes. Here, we present data from a novel thought sampling task that measures both the frequency and qualitative content of mind wandering, in the absence of a concurrent task to reduce cognitive demand. The task was validated in a non-pathological cohort of 31 older controls and resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a subset of participants (n=18) was conducted to explore the neural bases of mind wandering. Overall, instances of mind wandering were found to occur in 37% of experimental trials. Resting state functional connectivity analyses confirmed that mind wandering frequency was associated with regional patterns of both increased and decreased default network connectivity, namely in the temporal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Our findings demonstrate that the novel task provides a context of low cognitive demand, which is conducive to mind wandering. Furthermore, performance on the task is associated with specific patterns of functional connectivity in the default network. Together, this new paradigm offers an important avenue to investigate the frequency and content of mind wandering in the context of low cognitive demands, and has significant potential to be applied in clinical conditions with reduced cognitive resources.",

For this purpose, two simulation environments were created and compared based on the obtained information from a Chilean farm. The first scenario uses only a human-based workforce to perform all the avocado harvesting-related tasks, whilst the second scenario is based on a human-robot cooperative strategy proposed to improve the harvesting procedure. A total of 41 different tests for each simulated scenario was performed, and then a comparison of them in terms of production and expected human physical workload was obtained. The results showed that the use of a cooperative strategy during harvesting tasks can increase the production measured from the cargo zone from 15% to 80%, as well as the total harvested production from 23% to 85%, whilst the human workload only increases from 1% to 16%.

However, since the number of types of parts is often enormous, their stocktaking workload becomes a heavy burden in such a case. Especially, parts such as bolts and nuts are often stored in bulk containers, and they cannot be counted visually from the outside. So, they must be counted by taking out, and it increases the workload more. On the other hand, image recognition accuracy has been rapidly improved by the deep learning, and its applications to various fields are spreading in recent years. This suggests the automatic stocktaking by using images is possible, especially even for the bulk containers. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of automatic inventory satisfaction discrimination of order point for the parts stocked in the bulk containers. Furthermore, we investigated to apply it to the inventory management system. As a result, we found the precision of this discrimination was higher than a human being when there were many parts in a bulk container; also, we found the more effective inventory management would be possible by using this discrimination together with the data of production management system such as logical inventory.",

In this context, the present study sought to determine whether a brief cognitive assessment conducted by a robot elicited different interaction-related emotional processes than a traditional assessment conducted by an expert clinician. A non-clinical sample of 29 young adults (17 females; M = 24.5, SD = 2.3 years) were asked to complete two cognitive tasks twice, in counterbalanced order, once administered by an expert clinician and once by an autonomous humanoid robot. Self-reported measures of affective states and assessment of physiological arousal did not reveal any difference in emotional processes between human-human and human-robot interactions. Similarly, cognitive performances and workload did not differ across conditions. Analysis of non-verbal behaviour, however, showed that participants spent more time looking at the robot (d = 1.3) and made fewer gaze aversions (d = 1.3) in interacting with the robot than with the human examiner. We argue that, far from being a trivial ‘cosmetic change’, using a social robot in place of traditional testing could be a potential way to open up the development of a new generation of tests for brief cognitive assessment.",

The paper presents a structured procedure to automatically extract data from virtual analysis made by digital manufacturing tools and measure a set of indicators to validly assess manufacturing ergonomics. The research considers the state of the art in manufacturing ergonomics and defines a set of indicators suitable for manufacturing manual operations, focusing on assembly tasks. Furthermore, it defines a methodology to automatically extract data valorising the selected indicators and an application, based on Visual Basic, to generate the specific task list and related assessment. The result is a rapid and objective assessment, independent from the experience of the user, which can be executed during process design. The procedure has been applied to an industrial case study, where the manual assembly of cabin supports on the tractor chassis has been analysed in order to correct the most uncomfortable steps and obtain a more ergonomic process. A decrease of the EAWS score, calculated with the proposed method, allowed to validate the proposed solution, suggesting a redesign of the assembly cycle to improve the working conditions.

The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR.

It remains an active research topic. Those studies have assumed that production interruptions (or production breaks) cause forgetting, which deteriorates performance. Research on human working memory provides enough evidence that continuous forgetting, precisely cognitive interference, results from overloading the memory with information. Despite the evidence, few studies have incorporated it into learning curve models. This paper presents an enhanced version of the power learning curve that accounts for a variable degree of interference when moving from a production cycle to the next. It adopts the concept of memory trace decay to measure the residual (interference-adjusted), not the nominal (maximum) cumulative experience. We test the developed model against learning data from manual assembly and inspection tasks, with varying numbers of repetitions and breaks. We also test three alternative power-form learning and forgetting curve models from the literature. The results show that the interference-adjusted model fits the data very well. The proposed learning and forgetting model and its individualized cumulative metrics can help identify struggling workers early and release precocious learners earlier than expected. As such, the model gives insights for managers on the occurrence of interference to enable individual learning support.",

To bridge this gap for practical deployments, this paper proposes Co2iAR, a co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative AR assembly. Firstly, according to the stereo visual-inertial fusion strategy, robust and accurate self-contained motion tracking is achieved for the resource-constrained mobile AR platform, followed by a co-located alignment from multiple mobile AR clients on the shop floor. Then, a lightweight text-aware network for online wiring harness character recognition is proposed, as well as the audio-based confirming strategy, enabling natural audio-visual interaction among co-located workers within a shared immersive workplace, which can also monitor the current wiring assembly status and activate the step-by-step tutorials automatically. The novelty of this work is focused on the deployment of audio-visual aware interaction using the same device that is being used to deploy the co-located collaborative AR work instructions, establishing shared operating intents among multiple co-located workers. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on the collaborative performance among multiple AR clients, and results illustrate that the proposed Co2iAR can alleviate the cognitive load and achieve superior performance for the co-located AR assembly tasks, providing a more human-centric collaborative assembly performance.",

Within warehouses, order picking is a crucial task that is extremely time- and cost-intensive. While order picking systems (OPSs) have traditionally been operated manually, new technologies offer opportunities for reducing the workload of warehouse workers. These technologies include autonomous picking robots that can function in combination with human pickers within a shared workspace. This technology enables human–robot collaboration and enhances flexibility in system design, as robots can either support humans or work independently. Research on the advantages of these hybrid OPSs (HOPSs) for improving operational performance is still scarce, however. To contribute to closing this research gap, we propose an agent-based simulation model to investigate how HOPSs reduce the daily workload of human order pickers. The results reveal that HOPSs – if certain assignment rules for the picking tasks are considered – can reduce both the operational costs of the system and human workload compared to a pure manual or a fully automated OPS. Nonetheless, attention should be paid to control the item weight pickers are supposed to handle, as HOPSs reduce the travel distance of human pickers, resulting in a higher frequency of picking activities and an increased ergonomic risk for musculoskeletal disorders.",

It can be evaluated by human mental workload measured with electroencephalography (EEG). However, the time duration of different workload conditions within a task session is unequal due to varied psychophysiological processes across individuals. It leads to data imbalance of the EEG for training workload classifiers. Methods In this study, we propose an EEG feature oversampling technique, Gaussian-SMOTE based feature ensemble (GSMOTE-FE), for workload recognition with imbalanced classes. First, artificial EEG instances are drawn from a Gaussian distribution in the margin between the minority and majority workload classes. Tomek links are detected as clues to remove redundant feature vectors. Then, we embed a feature selection module based on the GINI importance while an ensemble classifier committee with bootstrap aggregating is used to further enhance classification performance. Results We validate the GSMOTE-FE framework based on an experiment that simulates operators to understand the correct meaning of the instructions in the Chinese language. Participants’ EEG signals and reaction time data were both recorded to validate the proposed workload classifier.

Given the research highlights on platform-based manufacturing service collaboration (MSC) offering high-quality service solutions, efficient service scheduling strategies are urgently needed to maximize overall utility amidst great computational complexity and unpredictable task arrivals. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel distributed online task dispatch and service scheduling (DOTDSS) strategy in platform-aggregated MSC. What sets our method apart is its goal to optimize a long-term average utility performance with considering queuing dynamics of manufacturing services in multi-task processing, thereby maintaining sustainable platform operations. Firstly, we jointly consider task dispatch and service scheduling decisions into the formulation of a quality-of-service aware (QoS) stochastics optimization problem. The newly constructed logarithmic utility function effectively strikes a trade-off between the throughput and capacity utilization of manufacturing services with diverse capabilities. By incorporating the goal of reducing queue lengths, we then transform the optimization problem into a form with less computational complexity and guaranteed optimality using Lyapunov optimization. We further propose a DOTDSS strategy that relies solely on the current system state and queue information to generate scalable MSC solutions. It does not need to predict task arrival statistics in advance, and it exhibits great adaptability to uncertainties in task arrivals and service availabilities. Finally, numerical results based on simulation data and real workload traces demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It also shows that the aggregation collaboration pattern among a group of candidates can achieve better performance than that by the optimal candidate alone.",

In order for a manufacturing system to remain competitive, it is necessary to compute such optimization problems quickly and efficiently. The limitations of conventional optimization methods frequently stem from a delicate balance between solution quality and computation time. Consequently, a pressing need for solution algorithms arises that can effectively transcend these limitations. This paper presents a novel Quantum Annealing-based solving algorithm (QASA) for computing FJSSP, leveraging the power of Quantum Annealing combined with classical techniques. The proposed approach aims to optimize a multi-criterial FJSSP considering makespan, total workload, and job priority simultaneously. QASA employs a Hamiltonian formulation with Lagrange parameters to integrate the problem's constraints and objectives. By assigning appropriate weights to the objectives, the method allows the prioritization of certain objectives over others. To handle the computational complexity of large FJSSP instances, the problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, and a decision logic based on bottleneck factors is employed to select critical jobs for computation combined with variable pruning techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on benchmark problems, considering makespan, total workload, and priority objectives. Therefore, QASA combining tabu search, simulated annealing, and Quantum Annealing is used for efficient computation and is compared with a classical solving algorithm (CSA) combining tabu search and simulated annealing. The results demonstrate that QASA outperforms CSA in terms of solution quality, as measured by set coverage and hypervolume ratio metrics. Furthermore, computational efficiency analysis reveals that QASA achieves superior Pareto solutions compared to the classical approach, with a reasonable increase in computation time.",

The main objectives of this paper are to consider the relationship between operators' MWL and eye responses in the task of operating marine engine interface. Also, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict the operators' MWL based on integrating eye response data. Eye response indices (pupil dilation, blink rate, fixation rate, and saccadic rate) were recorded, and two subjective rating methods (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Task Load Index [NASA-TLX] and subjective workload assessment technique [SWAT]) were used for 27 participants. The results again confirm that the eye response is sensitive to MWL in workload levels of the task when using the interface control. The ANN model developed by measuring these indices can predict the operators' MWL with the determination coefficient (R2) of 0.971, 0.912 and 0.918 for training, validation, and testing, respectively. These results indicated that the ANN approach is quite accurate for the prediction of operators' MWL based on eye response indices. Relevance to industry The developed model is expected to provide the operator with a reference value of their MWL by evaluating their physiological indices. This result might be applied for developing an intelligent prediction model in the actual work environment to inform or support the operator in a variety of ways. From this, the manager can organize the human resources for each task to sustain the appropriate MWL as well as to improve the work performance.",

Cloud manufacturing allows multiple users to request services at the same time by submitting their requirement tasks to a cloud manufacturing platform. The centralized management and operation of manufacturing services enable cloud manufacturing to deal with multiple manufacturing tasks in parallel. An important issue with cloud manufacturing is therefore how to optimally schedule multiple manufacturing tasks to achieve better performance of a cloud manufacturing system. Task workload provides an important basis for task scheduling in cloud manufacturing. Based on this idea, we present a cloud manufacturing multi-task scheduling model that incorporates task workload modelling and a number of other essential ingredients regarding services such as service efficiency coefficient and service quantity. Then we investigate the effects of different workload-based task scheduling methods on system performance such as total completion time and service utilization. Scenarios with or without time constraints are separately investigated in detail. Results from simulation experiments indicate that scheduling larger workload tasks with a higher priority can shorten the makespan and increase service utilization without decreasing task fulfilment quality when there is no time constraint. When time constraint is involved, the above strategy enables more tasks to be successfully fulfilled within the time constraint, and task fulfilment quality also does not deteriorate.",

Driving is a task that requires visual, manual and cognitive resources to perform. Secondary tasks, such as mobile phone use and interaction with in-built navigation, which load onto any of these three processing resources increase driver workload and can lead to impaired driving. Because workload and distraction potential are interrelated, a comprehensive method to assess driver workload that produces valid and predictive results is needed to advance the science of distraction potential evaluation. It is also needed to incorporate into New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) testing regimes. Workload measures of cognitive (DRT [Detection Response Task] Reaction Time), visual (DRT Miss Rate), subjective (NASA-TLX [driver workload questionnaire]), and temporal demand (Task Interaction Time) were collected as participants drove one of 40 vehicles while completing a variety of secondary tasks with varying interaction requirements. Of the evaluated measures, variance and power analyses demonstrated that Task Interaction Time is the most sensitive in detecting differences in driver workload between different in-vehicle HMIs, followed by DRT Miss Rate, NASA-TLX and finally DRT Reaction Time. There were relatively weak correlations between each of the four measures. These results suggest that Task Interaction Time, coupled with a reliable visual demand metric such as DRT Miss Rate, eye glance coding, or visual occlusion, more efficiently detect differences in driver workload between different HMIs compared to DRT Reaction Time and the NASA-TLX questionnaire. These results can be used to improve the understanding of the utility of each of these core driver workload measures in assessing driver distraction potential.",

Specifically, in the related research, it is kept on a high level of conceptual representation without analysis of the specific cloud products required for such infrastructure. In this work, we discuss cloud setup for smart manufacturing while taking into account four main pillars of cloud infrastructure required for standard IT solutions, namely: compute, storage, networking, and backups. We also consider different degrees of high availability requirements since these fundamentally impact how cloud architecture should be designed. After discussing these elements, we demonstrate how these elements are mapped to the real-world cloud offerings on the example use case of Microsoft Azure. We close the paper with a discussion on further consideration of operational costs while pointing out the complexity of the pricing model.",

The purpose of this study is to examine the inter-relation between RT, and intelligence in the population of athletes with mild to moderate (IQ 40–75) intellectual impairment (II), according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. IQ-scores were retrieved from the athlete-database, assessed prior to the study by means of the most recently standardized versions of the Stanford-Binet, Raven Progressive Matrices or Wechsler Intelligence Scales, i.e., WISC-V or WAIS-IV. Three RT tasks with increasing cognitive load were administered in this study. The sample consisted of 103 young individuals (32% females, mean age=24.4years, SD=5.8) with II (mean IQ=60.6, SD=9.2), performing the tests prior to competing in the Global Games; the highest level of sport competition, organized by the International Federation for Intellectual Disability Sport. We tested whether IQ and RT were correlated in this sample by means of Pearson's correlations. Afterwards, a comparison sample of tertiary education students was recruited (n=103; mean age=21.1, SD=2.4), whereby for each individual participant with II, a peer was selected on the basis of equal gender, practicing the same sport, and equal accumulated sport expertise. We focused on the possibility that RT tasks requiring higher cognitive load differentiate more between the samples. The 2×3 ANOVA demonstrated a significant group (athletes with II versus comparison group) by task (simple RT, choice RT, complex RT) interaction effect, indicating that the progression of RTs increase across the three tasks with increasing complexity, was more pronounced in the athletes with II than in the comparison sample. This is the first study investigating RT in a large sample of well-trained active individuals with II. It provides a benchmark for other studies and suggests that the impact of lower levels of intelligence on RT is most apparent in RT tasks with the highest cognitive load.",

Main advantages are a reduced lead time, a decrease of stock level and economies in transportation. At shop-floor, packages from inbound trucks are unloaded, moved across, sorted by destination and loaded onto outbound trucks. A case of study at Renault company is presented in this paper. Two important points are observed for this Renault crossdock center: (1) repackaging operations are performed for some products and (2) due to the high diversity of packages' dimensions and stacking rules, scheduling of inbound, repackaging and loading outbound trucks is a complex problem. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to schedule inbound trucks' arrival times (considering given soft time windows), shop-floor repackaging operations and outbound trucks' departure times. Capacitated temporary storage zones and a capacitated repack workshop are considered at crossdock shop-floor. The model seeks to minimize penalty costs related to inbound trucks' arrival times and consequently unbalanced workload of the repack workshop.

The study is motivated by a practical problem from the aluminium profiles manufacturing industry, where for shortening throughput times it is allowed to start production of standard and regular items without confirmed orders, holding a stock of semi-finished products. The first stage manufactures both, items to order and items to a stock of semi-finished products, while the second stage is a customization stage based on customer demand requests and specifications. The paper addresses the questions of where order release control should be exercised, i.e., at only one stage or at both stages, and when should it be exercised. Simulation results suggest that load-based order release can be successfully applied to this hybrid production system when combined with a replenishment control policy for semi-finished products. Load-based order release contributes to reduce the total throughput time and the percentage of tardy orders of both, MTO and FTO, while contributing to a reduction of the semi-finished products inventory levels required to achieve a given fill rate.

Sixty-three test participants were presented six two-minute recordings of environmental sounds, whereby the temporal position of one occurring sound peak or valley was varied. The experimental group was distracted from the test sounds and cognitively loaded by performing the Stroop Test during the sound presentation and retrospectively rated the sounds in terms of loudness and pleasantness. In contrast, the control group attentively listened to the sounds and rated them during and after listening. Results showed that participants in the experimental group rated the sounds on average as 6.7% more pleasant than the participants of the control group. Moreover, previous findings on the influence of the peak position on the retrospective judgments (recency effect) were replicated; however, no effect of the temporal position of sound valleys was found. Retrospective judgments in the control group could further be predicted by the averaged momentary judgment, the linear trend over time as well as the momentary judgment during the peak and the end. Findings thus emphasize the need of taking into account human (in)attention and memory processes when assessing complex environmental sounds.",

Additionally, the isolated integration of the delivery function within systems comprising three integrated functions has been found to improve efficiency by 18%. The study employs various heuristic techniques, including genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, random search, hybrid search, and evolutionary strategy, to assess the optimal solution method and rules for these functions. The Taguchi technique is employed to ascertain the optimal values for critical parameters, such as population size, mutation rate, crossover points, and random search rate. Among the solution methods investigated, genetic algorithms consistently yielded superior results Additionally, the weighted slack rule consistently exhibited notable effectiveness compared to other due-date assignment rules.

However, the pilot may already lose important information during a high workload, and thus the corresponding reaction of the adaptive interaction system would lag. Moreover, most adaptive interaction systems adopt the expert’s knowledge as a reference to generate information. Still, the tacit knowledge that reveals the information interrelationship is seldom studied, despite being the foundation of the interactive information display. To solve the above problems, we proposed an adaptive interaction system architecture with three subsystems. Firstly, we developed a workload level prediction subsystem, where physiological parameters are used to predict future workload levels, thus avoiding interaction system lag; Secondly, we developed a tacit expert knowledge mining subsystem to discover the interrelationship hidden in the expert’s perceived information, which will guide the interactive information interface. Thirdly, we developed a tips information inference subsystem to provide the lost SA information based on expert knowledge and the pilot’s online perceived information. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified via a comparative experiment utilizing the control interface of a remotely piloted aircraft.",

We show that this approach can generate desired mixture architectures that cover the full-parameter anisotropic space, with exceptional accuracy, speed, and efficiency. Transformation-induced thermal meta-devices can be constructed directly by assembling retrieved mixture architectures, regardless of the thermal functionalities. Different metadevices are designed and verified by simulations and experiments, demonstrating the feasibility and versatility of this strategy. The formulated method increases the design efficiency and holds better manufacturability, which holds promise for other physical fields, e.g., acoustics and mass diffusion.",

Before BCI could become a mainstream mode of HCI for CAD interfaces; fundamental studies directed towards understanding how humans mentally represent and process the geometry are needed. The outlined work in this paper presents an objective user study to understand shape recognition process in the humans. Specifically, we focus on the fundamental task of fragmentary shape identification. The problem of fragmentary shape recognition can be defined as follows: given a partial and incomplete minimalistic representation of a given shape, can one recognize the actual complete shape or object? In user studies, each subject was progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of an object to be recognized. During each stage of the experiment, the brain activity of users in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded with a BCI headset. The recorded signals are then processed to objectively study the fragmentary shape recognition process. The results of user studies conclusively show that the measured brain activities of subjects can serve as a very accurate proxy to estimate subjects fragmentary shape recognition process.",

However, in countries such as South Africa, the availability of social networks and support structures may improve patient capacity, especially when networks are governed by cultural patterns linked to the Pan-African philosophy of Ubuntu, which promotes solidarity through humanness and human dignity. We explore the mediating role Ubuntu plays in people's ability to self-manage HIV/NCD multimorbidity in underprivileged settings in urban and rural South Africa. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 patients living with HIV/NCD multimorbidity between February–April 2022. Patients attended public health clinics in Gugulethu, Cape Town and Bulungula, Eastern Cape. We analysed interviews using framework analysis, using the Cumulative Complexity Model (CuCoM) and Burden of Treatment Theory (BoTT) as frameworks through which to conceptualise the data. Results Despite facing economic hardship, people with multimorbidity in South Africa were able to cope with their workload. They actively used and mobilized family relations and external networks that supported them financially, practically, and emotionally, allowing them to better self-manage their chronic conditions. Embedded in their everyday life, patients, often unconsciously, embraced Ubuntu and its core values, including togetherness, solidarity, and receiving Imbeko (respect) from health workers. This enabled participants to share their treatment workload and increase self-management capacity. Conclusion Ubuntu is an important mediator for people living with multimorbidity in South Africa, as it allows them to navigate their treatment workload and increase their social capital and structural resilience, which is key to self-management capacity. Incorporating Ubuntu and linked African support theories into current treatment burden models will enable better understandings of patients’ collective support and can inform the development of context-specific social health interventions that fit the needs of people living with chronic conditions in African settings.",

Object assembly is one of them. For an AR aid to support Ready-to-Assemble (RTA) furniture particularly, the challenge is to effectively design the visual features and mode of interaction, so that the first-time users can quickly conceive spatial relations of its parts. However, AR developers and engineers do not have sufficient guidelines to achieve such performance-driven goals. The scientific evidence and account of how one could cognitively benefit in object assembly can be useful to guide them. This experimental research developed an Augmented Reality (AR) application on the Microsoft HoloLens™ headset, and tested it on the first-time users of RTA furniture. The controlled experiments and behavioral analyses of fourteen participants in working out the two RTA furniture with different assembly complexity showed that, the application was effective to improve spatial problem-solving abilities. Especially, the positive effects of the AR-based supports stood out against the assembly of higher complexity. The findings have implications for the information design of advanced AR applications to support assembly tasks with high demands of spatial knowledge. In addition, the extensive analyses of the participants’ performance, behaviors, cognitive workload, and subjective responses helped identify usability issues with the Microsoft HoloLens™.",

These factors are aggravated by neuromuscular dysfunction, collateral complications, and side effects of medication in motor-impaired people. We therefore proposed to develop a simulated living-environment platform (SLEP) that was tailored to severely paralyzed people and also allowed the progressive user–system adaptation through increasingly demanding scenarios. This platform consisted of a synchronous motor imagery based BCI system, an everyday assistive computer program, and a virtual dwelling place. The SLEP was tested in 11 healthy users, where the user–system adaptation was evaluated according to the BCI accuracy for classifying the user control tasks. The user heart rate was also incorporated in the evaluation in order to verify the progressiveness of such adaptation. The results of this study showed that user performance tended to increase from the least to the most challenging scenario in learning situations. The results also showed that nine of the eleven users controlled the BCI system in cue-driven mode, completing over half of the tasks. Two of the eleven users controlled the BCI system in target-driven mode, completing two tasks. Taken together, these results suggest that the progressive adaptation in BCI systems can enhance the performance, the persistence and the confidence of the users, even when they are immersed in simulated daily-living situations.",

The cognitive load was manipulated between subjects using three versions of the DIVA Task (intensive warming-up condition, moderate warming-up condition and the control one). Following the experimental manipulation, the availability of cognitive resources during vigilance task was checked. Some significant effects of experimental manipulation were observed. First, in the context of overall task performance, subjects from the intensive warming-up condition obtained lower total errors rate than subjects from the control one. Some moderate effect of cognitive warming-up on time-on-task performance was also observed, although it was isolated to false alarms rate. Those results, tentatively suggesting the occurrence of the cognitive warming-up effect in vigilance performance, are then discussed.

Many researchers propose the class complexity metrics for object oriented design. Aloysius et al., has proposed a class complexity metric called Attribute Weighted Class Complexity (AWCC) from Extended Weighted Class Complexity (EWCC).The metric AWCC was calculated by adding the complexity of methods, attributes and complexity due to inheritance. The main limitation of AWCC is that on calculating inherited complexity, the Cognitive Load (CL) assigned to Lth level in inheritance hierarchy was assumed to be 1 always, but the cognitive load to understand the different levels ofinheritance can’t be same. So, there is a need for a metric to overcoming the limitations of AWCC. Hence, a new metric namely Cognitive Weighted Inheritance Class complexity (CWICC) is proposed in this paper. In CWICC, cognitive weights are assigned for each level of inheritance and also calculate the complexity due to the reusing of different types of attributes. The proposed metric has been validated empirically and also theoretically by using the properties of Weyuker’s. The result is matched with otherexisting measures and it shows that the proposed metric is to be a more appropriate indicator to measure the complexity of the class.",

During surface machining, cutter workpiece engagement (CWE) area of the ball-end mill continuously varies with surface characteristics and the tool paths. Additionally, the actual position of the tool involved in cutting also changes, leading to uneven wear distribution on the ball-end mill, making tool wear prediction and evaluation challenging. In this paper, a discretization calculation method of tool path length for surface machining is proposed based on PowerMill post-processing development. The linear cutting length of tool path for each corresponding tool posture is calculated, and the approximate calculation model of average milling distance of single tooth for cutting edge element is established. The correlation mapping between NC machining program, tool posture and cutting workload of cutting edge element is realized. A tool wear model that considers effective cutting distance is developed, enabling the prediction of wear distribution along the flank of the ball-end mill under the surface machining conditions. Comparative experiments were conducted on tool wear under different feed directions during curved surface machining.

Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for Android Apps.

Specific characteristics of this model include the simultaneous consideration of production planning, coexistence of alternative process routings, lot splitting, workload balancing between cells and worker over-assignment to multiple cells. Motivated by the inefficiency of exact approaches, this paper proposes a hybrid approach combining combinatorial particle swarm optimization and linear programming (CPSO-LP) to efficiently solve real-sized problems. In CPSO-LP, decision variables corresponding to part routing selection and part operation assignment are fixed and other variables are allowed to be changed.

Its value has been predominantly demonstrated via analyses of the topological structure of graphs of arguments and its formal properties. However, limited research exists on the examination and comparison of its inferential capacity in real-world modelling tasks and against other knowledge-representation and non-monotonic reasoning methods. This study is focused on a novel comparison between defeasible argumentation and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning when applied to the representation of the ill-defined construct of human mental workload and its assessment. Different argument-based and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning models have been designed considering knowledge-bases of incremental complexity containing uncertain and conflicting information provided by a human reasoner. Findings showed how their inferences have a moderate convergent and face validity when compared respectively to those of an existing baseline instrument for mental workload assessment, and to a perception of mental workload self-reported by human participants. This confirmed how these models also reasonably represent the construct under consideration. Furthermore, argument-based models had on average a lower mean squared error against the self-reported perception of mental workload when compared to fuzzy-reasoning models and the baseline instrument. The contribution of this research is to provide scholars, interested in formalisms on knowledge-representation and non-monotonic reasoning, with a novel approach for empirically comparing their inferential capacity.",

In such simulations, laser heat source modeling remains a central concern as the mechanisms governing the material deformations and phase changes strongly depend on the input laser energy and its distribution details. Ray tracing (RT) is a realistic and accurate approach for high-fidelity heat source modeling that can capture surface heterogeneity and multiple reflections. However, RT heat source modeling for particle-based numerical methods faces additional challenges rooted in the lack of explicit surface representation, intensive computational efforts, and implementation complexities. This work addresses these issues by proposing an enhanced and efficient RT heat source model for particle-based laser manufacturing simulations with negligible computational overhead and without requiring background nodes or surface mesh reconstruction. After validating the RT heat source model versus analytical and experimental results, we assess its computational performance through two test cases, showing that the computing workload imposed by our RT model is between 0.1% and 25% of the total runtime in different SPH-based laser manufacturing simulations. With the achieved efficiency and robustness, it becomes convenient yet advantageous to simulate processes like laser drilling and laser powder bed fusion with precision far beyond the conventional approaches using volumetric heat sources.",

This study addresses the dynamic flexible job shop schedule problem with transportation resources (DFJSPT) in which new job insertion, the most common unexpected event in a manufacturing system, is treated as a dynamic disturbance. A proactive-reactive methodology is adopted to respond to dynamic disturbances. Correspondingly, a two-stage multi-objective mixed-integer programming model is formulated for the proposed DFJSPT. In the initial scheduling stage, the model aims to minimize makespan and workload imbalance. In the rescheduling stage, instability minimisation is introduced to deal with the impact of the disturbance. To solve this complex problem, a multi-objective adaptive large neighbourhood search (MOALNS) algorithm is developed. Its novel heuristic operators supporting multi-objective optimization are designed to explore the neighbourhood of a solution. Moreover, the amount of domination between the solutions from the Archive is applied in the acceptance criteria. Overall, we validate the efficiency of the developed model and algorithm through a number of numerical experiments. The computational results verify the accuracy of the mathematical model and demonstrate the superiority of MOALNS in several aspects, including convergence, diversity, and the ability to search for high-quality solutions. In addition to its effectiveness, the algorithm is able to handle dynamic events flexibly, which makes it a suitable option for real-world applications of the DFJSPT.",

In a real job shop, transportation and setup times account for a large percentage of the total processing flow, and with today's companies demanding higher delivery times, the feasibility and punctuality of scheduling will be considerably reduced if these time constraints are ignored. Recently, several companies have become green in their manufacturing processes. However, transportation, setup, and delivery times have rarely been combined with energy efficiency. To solve this problem, we employed an integer programming approach to develop a complete mathematical model of the problem and simultaneously optimized four objectives: maximum completion time, total energy consumption, workload of critical machines, and penalties for earliness/tardiness. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm incorporating reinforcement learning was proposed to solve the model. The algorithm had the following features: (1) four initialization strategies were designed to obtain high-quality populations; (2) a reinforcement learning-based parameter-adaptive strategy was proposed to guide the population to select the best parameters; (3) a critical path-based neighborhood structure with transportation and setup times was designed, and according to the objectives of this study, four additional neighborhood structures were designed; (4) a reference point-based non-dominated sorting selection was presented to guide the solution toward the Pareto-optimal front; and (5) an external archive was proposed to enhance the utilization of abandoned historical solutions. Finally, the effectiveness of this algorithm was demonstrated using 33 benchmark instances of variants and comparison experiments.",

In this paper, an experiment was designed to obtain the electroencephalogram (EEG) data under three levels of mental workload. The EEG data of multiple subjects were used for the mental workload classification based on the stochastic configuration network (SCN). The subject-specific classifiers (SSCs) were built by the individual EEG data. The results showed that the range of SSC test accuracy was between 56.5 % and 90.2 % with an average of 75.9 %. The SSC accuracy had a positive correlation with the operating accuracy (r = 0.852, p < 0.01). For comparison, the subject-multiple classifiers (SMCs) were established with the EEG data of multiple subjects. The results showed that the SSCs had a lower time-consuming and higher prediction accuracy than the SMCs. But the SMCs might embody the trend of statistical performance for a large number of subjects. This study provided an effective modeling method for the classification of mental workload, and it would bring great convenience to the practical application in the future.",

This leaves a gap in comprehending the efficiency and robustness of eHMIs during interactions with scalable AVs. To bridge the gap, this study pioneers an exploration of pedestrians' road-crossing decisions, perceived clarity, and gaze behaviour during synchronous interactions with multiple AVs equipped with different eHMIs. An eye-tracking experiment was conducted, involving 48 video stimuli depicting two AVs (with yielding patterns and eHMIs manipulated) approaching a predetermined road-crossing location from the same side of a two-way, four-lane, un-signalized road. Each yielding AV will present one of four eHMI manipulations (i.e., light band, smiling expression, pedestrian symbol, and no eHMI as baseline), resulting in 16 unique eHMI combinations and video stimuli. Eighty-seven participants were recruited and tasked to respond to approaching AVs, during which their road-crossing decision time, perceived clarity, and gaze metrics were recorded. Findings revealed that different eHMIs across AVs were associated with prolonged road-crossing decision times, diminished perceived clarity, and intensified visual attention as evidenced by increased fixation counts and durations. Regarding AVs equipped with the same eHMIs, the pedestrian symbol-based eHMIs resulted in heightened clarity perception, reduced crossing decision times and visual engagement, in contrast to eHMIs presented in abstract light bands or smiling expressions. Furthermore, for eHMI-different AVs, those featuring only one eHMI within AVL-AVR pairs were perceived as less clear, eliciting heightened visual cognitive load and decision times. Integration of a pedestrian symbol-based eHMI in AVL-AVR configurations garnered superior clarity ratings and facilitated time savings. These findings of this pioneering study provide insights for eHMI design for future AVs in complex traffic scenarios with scalable road users.",

Many of them are focusing on the parallel processing paradigm, such as MapReduce, Apache Hive, Apache Flink. However, in this jungle of frameworks, the performance evaluation of these technologies is not a trivial task, and strictly depends on the application requirements. The scope of this paper is to compare two of the most employed and promising frameworks to manage big data: Apache Flink and Apache Hive, which are general purpose distributed platforms under the umbrella of the Apache Software Foundation. To evaluate these two frameworks we use the benchmark BigBench, developed for Apache Hive. We re-implemented the most significant queries of Apache Hive BigBench to make them work on Apache Flink, in order to be able to compare the results of the same queries executed on both frameworks. Our results show that Apache Flink, if it is configured well, is able to outperform Apache Hive.",

This system enabled the robot to provide adaptive aid without the need for explicit commands from the human teammate, through the use of multiple physiological workload measures. Such measures of workload vary in sensitivity and there is large inter-individual variability in physiological responses to imposed taskload. Workload models enacted via closed-loop system should accommodate such individual variability. The present research investigated the effects of the adaptive robot aid vs. imposed aid on performance and workload. Results showed that adaptive robot aid driven by an individualized workload model for physiological response resulted in greater improvements in performance compared to aid that was simply imposed by the system.",

However, human factors/ergonomics dictates that in order to make the complex, cognitive work of healthcare delivery safer, health IT must properly support human cognition. This means, for example, that new health IT must reduce, not increase, workload during safety-critical tasks. The present study was the first to quantitatively assess the short- and long-term impact of bar coded medication administration (BCMA) IT on nurses' mental workload as well as on perceived medication safety. One-hundred seventy registered nurses across 3 dissimilar clinical units at an academic, freestanding pediatric hospital in the Midwest US participated in surveys administered before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the hospital implemented BCMA. Nurses rated their external mental workload (interruptions, divided attention, being rushed) and internal mental workload (concentration, mental effort) during medication administration tasks as well as the likelihood of each of three medication safety events: medication administration errors, medication errors on the clinical unit, and clinical unit-level adverse drug events. Clinical unit differences were assessed. Findings generally confirmed the hypothesis that external but not internal mental workload was associated with the perceived likelihood of a medication safety event. Comparisons of mental workload from pre- to post-BCMA revealed statistically significant changes in the critical care unit only. Medication safety appeared to improve over the long term in the hematology/oncology unit only. In the critical care and medical/surgical units, medication safety exhibited short-term improvements that were eliminated over time. Changes in mental workload and medication safety, two classically microergonomic constructs, were deeply embedded in macroergonomic phenomena. These included the fit between the BCMA system and the nature of nursing work, the process of BCMA implementation, and BCMA interactions with concurrent changes occurring in the hospital. Findings raise questions about achieving sustainable performance improvement with health IT as well as the balance between micro- and macroergonomic approaches to studying technology change. Relevance to industry Designers must consider how technology changes cognitive work, including mental workload. Hospitals and other implementers of technology must ensure that new technology fits its users, their tasks, and the context of use, which may entail tailoring implementation, for example, to specific clinical units. Evaluators must look over time to assess both changes in cognitive work and implementation issues. Healthcare practitioners must also recognize that new technology means a complex transformation to an already complex sociotechnical system, which calls for a macroergonomic approach to design and analysis.",

The combined effects of the cold exposure and work intensity on human cognitive performance remain unclear. In this paper, the experiments of six Chinese young men exposed to an extremely cold environment (-10 °C) were conducted in a climatic chamber. The work intensity level was graded according to the metabolic rate corresponding to three walking speeds. Nine cognitive functions and one perceived were recorded to evaluate the subjects’ cognitive performance, including NCTB (seven items), Stroop, and RPE were measured. The increase of workload from moderate to high could lead to the acceleration of fatigue speed and the aggravation of fatigue degree 5 min earlier. Moderate work intensity is a noteworthy work level in extremely cold environment, which is an inflection point in the impact of fatigue and cognitive levels. The manual dexterity significantly increases by the workload intensity, and the high work intensity makes the hands more dexterous (29% increase). Extremely cold environment has a significant effect on short-term memory (decreased 33%). The selective attention was reduced by 16% in the extremely cold environment. With the moderate work intensity in extremely cold environment, the perceived judgment response speed would decrease. The combined effects of the extremely cold environment and the workload on the cognitive functions of psychomotor ability and attention or sensorimotor speed should be paid more attention to.",

For the problem, blocks are assigned to assembly shops for processing; some blocks must be assigned as a group to a region, a collection of assembly shops, because of their mutual dependency. Each assembly shop has its target work level. The objective is to minimize the sum of workload deviations of the assembly shops during a specific planning period. Because the mathematical model could not be solved within a reasonable time, a two-stage matheuristic algorithm was proposed. The algorithm determines the region of blocks in the first stage and the assembly shop for each block in the second stage. Computational experiments were performed using a real-world instance provided by the shipbuilder, including instances of different sizes generated from real-world data. The experiment results demonstrated that the algorithm yielded remarkable reductions of 10.5% and 35.3% in assignment costs and factory workload violations compared with manual planning, respectively. The proposed decomposition-based algorithm also demonstrated superior effectiveness in solving the problem than the full mathematical model.

A key question regarding their interaction is how the decision-control is divided between the DSS and the user, represented by the system's level of automation (LoA). To investigate the need for an adaptable DSS where users can manually adjust the LoA across situations, we used a vignette design to examine whether users prefer different LoA in different situations (i.e., six situational criteria, each manipulated by two specifications; e.g., low vs. high workload). In the twelve vignettes, the 116 participants should imagine working in an emergency control-center—a setting they were familiar with from previous experiments. Our results showed significant differences between the two corresponding vignettes, indicating that users prefer different LoA across situations. However, after controlling for the participants' overall preference for a situation-independent baseline LoA, the significant differences between all paired vignettes disappear. Our results have implications for whether situational or individual criteria are more important regarding LoA preferences, adaptable DSS, and for human-centered design based on user profiles. We discuss our findings in relation to the broader literature on trust and acceptance of DSS.",

We employed a novel analysis method, deep autoencoder dynamical analysis (DADA), with 100 healthy adults selected from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set in rest and six cognitive tasks. The deep autoencoder of DADA described seven recurrent stochastic metastable substates from the functional connectome of BOLD phase coherence matrices. These substates were significantly differentiated in terms of their probability of appearance, time duration, and spatial attributes. We found that during different cognitive tasks, there was a higher probability of having more connected substates dominated by a high degree of connectivity in the thalamus. In addition, compared with those during tasks, resting brain dynamics have a lower level of predictability, indicating a more uniform distribution of metastability between substates, quantified by higher entropy. These novel findings provide empirical evidence for the philosophically motivated cognitive theory, suggesting on-line and off-line as two fundamentally distinct modes of cognition. On-line cognition refers to task-dependent engagement with the sensory input, while off-line cognition is a slower, environmentally detached mode engaged with decision and planning. Overall, the DADA framework provides a bridge between neuroscience and cognitive theory that can be further explored in the future.",

The present fMRI study investigates the functional brain networks that may facilitate such behavior by enabling temporal adaptation (error correction), prediction, and the monitoring and integration of information about ‘self’ and the external environment. Participants were required to synchronize finger taps with computer-controlled auditory sequences that were presented either at a globally steady tempo with local adaptations to the participants' tap timing (Virtual Partner task) or with gradual tempo accelerations and decelerations but without adaptation (Tempo Change task). Connectome-based predictive modelling was used to examine patterns of brain functional connectivity related to individual differences in behavioral performance and parameter estimates from the adaptation and anticipation model (ADAM) of sensorimotor synchronization for these two tasks under conditions of varying cognitive load. Results revealed distinct but overlapping brain networks associated with ADAM-derived estimates of temporal adaptation, anticipation, and the integration of self-controlled and externally controlled processes across task conditions. The partial overlap between ADAM networks suggests common hub regions that modulate functional connectivity within and between the brain's resting-state networks and additional sensory-motor regions and subcortical structures in a manner reflecting coordination skill. Such network reconfiguration might facilitate sensorimotor synchronization by enabling shifts in focus on internal and external information, and, in social contexts requiring interpersonal coordination, variations in the degree of simultaneous integration and segregation of these information sources in internal models that support self, other, and joint action planning and prediction.",

In practice, batch processes frequently produce new process modes due to various factors, such as changes in operating recipes, uncertainty in the external environment, and various product specifications. When this is the case, directly applying the historical model may lead to unexpected results. Moreover, it may be impractical to conduct enough trial runs and wait until sufficient batches are available before modeling for the new mode. Therefore, the problem of modeling for a new process mode with insufficient data brings challenges for the soft-sensor issue, which has rarely been addressed before. To solve the problem as mentioned above, a novel transfer and incremental soft-sensor scheme is developed for batch manufacturing processes with the support of multiple historical process modes, termed mode-cloud here. Using the proposed algorithm, the production data from the cloud of historical modes can be explored and utilized regarding their different phase-based relationships between process variables and product qualities. Thus, a new objective function is constructed to automatically identify and quantify the information buried in the vast ocean of historical data to determine the initial soft-sensor model for the new mode with limited data. Besides, with the constant increase of new samples, the initial soft-sensor model can incrementally update model parameters and release the workload of repetitive modeling. With both transfer modeling and incremental updating abilities, the proposed algorithm, which we call mode-cloud based transfer incremental learning (MTIL), can not only offer high adaptability and flexibility to accommodate a new process mode quickly, but also ensure the prediction accuracy. The MTIL based soft-sensor scheme is applied to the real injection molding process for the illustration purpose.",

Expense and imprecision are the two main issues in generating ground truth (GT) segmentations. In this paper, in an attempt to overcome these two issues jointly, we propose a method, named SparseGT, which exploit variability among human segmenters to maximally save manual workload in GT generation for evaluating actual segmentations by algorithms. Pseudo ground truth (p-GT) segmentations are created by only a small fraction of workload and with human-level perfection/imperfection, and they can be used in practice as a substitute for fully manual GT in evaluating segmentation algorithms at the same precision. p-GT segmentations are generated by first selecting slices sparsely, where manual contouring is conducted only on these sparse slices, and subsequently filling segmentations on other slices automatically. By creating p-GT with different levels of sparseness, we determine the largest workload reduction achievable for each considered object, where the variability of the generated p-GT is statistically indistinguishable from inter-segmenter differences in full manual GT segmentations for that object. Furthermore, we investigate the segmentation evaluation errors introduced by variability in manual GT by applying p-GT in evaluation of actual segmentations by an algorithm. Experiments are conducted on ∼500 computed tomography (CT) studies involving six objects in two body regions, Head & Neck and Thorax, where optimal sparseness and corresponding evaluation errors are determined for each object and each strategy. Our results indicate that creating p-GT by the concatenated strategy of uniformly selecting sparse slices and filling segmentations via deep-learning (DL) network show highest manual workload reduction by ∼80-96% without sacrificing evaluation accuracy compared to fully manual GT. Nevertheless, other strategies also have obvious contributions in different situations. A non-uniform strategy for slice selection shows its advantage for objects with irregular shape change from slice to slice. An interpolation strategy for filling segmentations can achieve ∼60-90% of workload reduction in simulating human-level GT without the need of an actual training stage and shows potential in enlarging data sets for training p-GT generation networks. We conclude that not only over 90% reduction in workload is feasible without sacrificing evaluation accuracy but also the suitable strategy and the optimal sparseness level achievable for creating p-GT are object- and application-specific.",

Previous studies have considered human resources as a number representing a fix quantity of available entities without considering their mental capabilities. This research measured mental workload using a perceptual tool, NASA-TLX, as well as physiological responses. The purpose was to balance patient appointments and increase resource utilization while taking into consideration the balance of human workload as a constraint in the mathematical model. Mental workload was included to assure a balance in the capacity of the human resources without overloading them. The mathematical model was able to successfully build a patient scheduling model considering nurses’ workload.

This situation has been reached by powerful data partitioning and data allocation techniques and algorithms. By analyzing these findings closely, we figure out that they are quickly stressed by the workload changes, which represents the usual case of business analytics applications. To deal with this challenge in the context of big data warehouses, several studies proposed to move to another processing paradigm outside the DBMS realm such as Spark by proposing adaptive partitioning solutions to tackle the workload changes. The majority of approaches are offline and those that are online cause significant random disk I/O costs. This is because the correlation that may exist between jobs and data blocks read from the disk is not captured to refine the adaptive partitioning algorithms. This represents one of the major causes of providing high performance of dynamic workloads. To solve such limitations, we propose in this paper a proactive framework for query-aware adaptive partitioning (called PROADAPT) that uses an AI-inspired methodology that can be connected to any query optimizer managing partitioned data. This methodology uses a genetic algorithm to solve our formalized problem that considers the interaction that may exist among workload queries. PROADAPT intensively rewrites queries by exploiting dimension hierarchies to skip irrelevant data and then improves I/O performance. Different technical modules of our framework are discussed. Finally, we conduct intensive experiments on Postgres-XL and a Spark SQL parallel cluster to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

In this paper, we define intuitive reward functions and show that these can be readily transformed for integration with the proposed POMDP model. We synthesize a near-optimal control policy using transparency as the feedback variable based on solutions for two cases: 1) increasing human trust and reducing workload, and 2) improving overall performance along with the aforementioned objectives for trust and workload. We implement these solutions in a reconnaissance mission study in which human subjects are aided by a virtual robotic assistant in completing a series of missions. We show that it is not always beneficial to aim to improve trust; instead, the control objective should be to optimize a context-specific performance objective when designing intelligent decision-aid systems that influence trust-workload behavior.",34

Here, we systematically studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under three experimental conditions — rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8Hz. We also measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest, found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a wider frequency range than the 8–12Hz band many studies tend to include in their analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results against certain subjects and conditions.",

Tele-operation is key in the exploration of the Moon, and allows for robotic elements to be controlled from orbital infrastructure and other planetary bodies such as the Earth. Considering that future missions aim to control rovers (amongst others for sampling tasks) from Earth (delay: 3s), the Gateway (delay: 0.5s) and the Moon (delay: 0s), control under the time-delay conditions for these locations must be studied. Time-delay can affect performance, and understanding the performance means that mission operations can be planned bottom-up, which benefits both the preparation of the crew and the design of rovers. An experiment was conducted with 18 engineers who were assigned to control a robotic arm under three time-delay conditions, representing the three control locations. Several metrics were derived from cardiac, ocular, subjective and behavioral measures. The analyses disclosed that the large time-delay condition statistically increased the perceived workload, the time to complete the mission and decreased heart rate variability compared to the other conditions. However, no effect of time-delay was found on attentional and executive abilities. The metrics proved to be effective in the study of performance quantification in human-robot interaction for tele-operations in lunar control scenarios. This approach can be implemented for a larger range of robotic activities, such as tele-operated driving.",

Error characteristics of human observers (often referred to as soft data sensors) have typically been artificially generated and lack contextual considerations that in a real-world application can drastically change the accuracy and precision of these characteristics. The proposed framework and method relies on error values that change based upon known and unknown states of qualifying variables empirically shown to affect observation accuracy under different contexts. This approach allows fusion systems to perform uncertainty alignment on data coming from human observers. The preprocessed data yields a more complete and reliable situation assessment when it is processed by data association and stochastic graph matching algorithms. This paper also provides an approach and results of initial validation testing of the proposed methodology. The testing approach leverages error characterization models for several exemplar categories of observation in combination with simulated synthetic data. Results have shown significant performance improvements with respect to both data association and situation assessment fusion processes with an average F-measure improvement of 0.16 and 0.20 for data association and situation assessment respectively. These F-measure improvements are representative of fewer incorrect and missed associations and fewer graph matching results, which then must be considered by human analysts. These benefits are expected to translate into a reduction of the overall cognitive workload facing human analysts in situations where they are tasked with developing and maintaining situational awareness.",

Further, recent work has found that reward and feedback have a unique role in modulating conflict processing and cognitive control. However, it is still not clear how conflict, especially concerning the processing and evaluation of feedback, impacts learning. To address this, we examined the effects of feedback competition on feedback evaluation in a reinforcement learning task. Specifically, we had participants play a simple two-choice gambling game while electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. On half of the experiment blocks, we reversed the meaning of performance feedback for each trial from its prepotent meaning to induce response conflict akin to the Stroop effect (e.g., ‘✓’ meant incorrect). Behaviourally, we found that participants’ accuracy was reduced as a result of incongruent feedback. Paralleling this, an analysis of our EEG revealed that incongruent feedback resulted in a reduction in amplitude of the reward positivity and the P300, components of the human event-related brain potential implicated in reward processing. Our results demonstrate the negative impact of conflict on feedback evaluation and the impact of this on subsequent performance.",

Sign languages offer a unique perspective on this issue, because prelingually Deaf children who receive access to complex linguistic input later in life provide a window into brain maturation in the absence of language, and subsequent neuroplasticity of neurolinguistic networks during late language learning. While the duration of sensitive periods of acquisition of linguistic subsystems (sound, vocabulary, and syntactic structure) is well established on the basis of L2 acquisition in spoken language, for sign languages, the relative timelines for development of neural processing networks for linguistic sub-domains are unknown. We examined neural responses of a group of Deaf signers who received access to signed input at varying ages to three linguistic phenomena at the levels of classifier signs, syntactic structure, and information structure. The amplitude of the N400 response to the marked word order condition negatively correlated with the age of acquisition for syntax and information structure, indicating increased cognitive load in these conditions. Additionally, the combination of behavioral and neural data suggested that late learners preferentially relied on classifiers over word order for meaning extraction. This suggests that late acquisition of sign language significantly increases cognitive load during analysis of syntax and information structure, but not word-level meaning.",

As a result, a framework including all of the effects (consolidated and inconclusive) found of AM adoption on a company's business was developed. While various effects (e.g., the feasibility of a complex product, the freedom of product design, mass customization capability, and product variety) have frequently been studied in the literature and are consolidated, some are still considered consolidated effects but presenting only conceptual studies (e.g., enterprise reliability, equipment reliability/availability for maintenance, information flow, and production democratization) then needed practical research.

PI is a new architectural approach in which the computing infrastructure, represented by resources, networks, storage, becomes dynamic and is controlled by the application, in contrast with traditional architectures where the application has to adapt to a static infrastructure. For MES applications, the adoption of PI has the potential to add a new layer of flexibility and optimization by allowing quick configuration and re-configuration based on environmental changes, especially in the context of virtualization in private cloud where workloads can be provisioned and de-provisioned in real time. In this context, this paper presents the main redundancy and scalability requirements for the workloads identified in ISA-95.03 based solutions and discusses in detail the strategies to assure the redundancy and scalability requirements of these workloads both individually and at the system level. The main contributions of this paper are therefore the introduction of PI combined with private cloud virtualization at the MES layer in order to achieve redundancy and scalability of the control solution. The pilot implementation presented is based on PI concepts and is realized in practice using SOA BPEL and IBM CloudBurst REST APIs. The MES system considered for the pilot implementation adopts a multi-agent vMES architecture having COBASA-type functionality. The experimental results presented in this paper show the system response in a set of failure scenarios, with focus on the reconfiguration time of workloads, and the dynamic response to perturbations in the system.",

Therefore, this study focuses on the fundamental principles of seru system balancing. For a seru, we define and formulate seru balance (SB) to describe workloads balance of the workers in the seru. For a seru system containing more serus, the seru system balance (SSB) needs to be evaluated from workloads balance of all workers and workloads balance among all serus. Consequently, we define and formulate intra-seru system balancing (Intra-SSB) and inter-seru system balancing (Inter-SSB) to evaluate the two perspectives respectively. We theoretically develop the lower and upper bounds of Intra-SSB and Inter-SSB respectively. In addition, we define and formulate the seru system balancing problem (SSBP) as a bi-objective model with maximizing Intra-SSB and Inter-SSB simultaneously. The property of solution space for SSBP is analyzed. Finally, we develop an improved algorithm based on ε-constraint for SSBP. The algorithm saves computation time by cutting non-Pareto-optimal solutions before performing ε-constraint.",

Performance on the SART was degraded when the semi-squatting posture was adopted and did not recover after 15 min of rest. The SART was rated as less frustrating when the exoskeleton was worn, while less time pressure and task conflict were reported and the need to exert self-control to maintain the posture was rated lower.

However, subjects’ increase in heart rate when squatting, without the exoskeleton, was positively correlated with an increase in their SART error rate.

Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection.",

Among these, the effects of emotional state and stress have received considerable attention in the context of crash analysis and safety research where driving behaviour has been found to be affected by drivers’ mental state/stress, cognitive workload and distraction. However, these studies are mostly based on questionnaire surveys and self-reports which can be prone to response bias and reporting/measurement errors. The analyses are also often descriptive in nature. In a parallel stream of research, advances in sensor technologies have made it possible to observe drivers’ stress through human physiological responses, e.g. heart rate, electro-dermal activity etc. However, these studies have primarily focused on detecting stress rather than quantifying or modelling its effects on driving decisions. The present paper combines these two approaches in a single framework and investigates the gap-acceptance behaviour of drivers during an intersection crossing, using data collected using a driving simulator. The participants are deliberately subjected to stress induced by time pressure, and their stress levels are measured using two physiological indicators, namely Electrodermal Activity (skin conductance) and heart rate. In addition to statistical analyses, discrete choice models are developed to link the accept-reject choices of a driver with the driver demographics, traffic conditions and stress levels. The results of the models indicate that increased stress levels significantly increase the probabilities of accepting a gap. The improvement in model fit and safety implications derived from model estimates are also discussed. The insights from the results can be used for designing appropriate intervention strategies to improve safety.",

The integrate view of mental human models, the cognitive demand of the working environment and the automation design is essential. Human-Syste Integration (HSI) constitutes a promising approach. Current model-based approaches offer possibilities to analyze and optimize tasks within a overall system, but they still lack integration. This leads to the research question: How can human factors be integrated into a system model of socio-technical, Cyber-Physical Production System? The paper at hand contributes an approach of human factor integration into the procedu of Model-Based Systems Engineering for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). The approach combines a system model of a CPPS wi HSI concepts. In accordance to the benefits of MBSE, SysML is selected to integrate human factors in the development process of a CPPS. Th approach is divided into five steps, which include the extension of the SysML meta model. This allows the optimization of skill-based huma machine interaction. Defined HSI-Profiles enable system developers to integrate employee requirements at early stages within the developme process.

A key position assumes these failures arise from insufficient monitoring of rapidly produced intuitions. These faulty intuitions are thought to arise from a proposed substitution process, by which reasoners unknowingly interpret more difficult questions as easier ones. Recent work, however, suggests that reasoners are not blind to this substitution process, but in fact detect that their erroneous responses are not warranted. Using the popular bat-and-ball problem, we investigated whether this substitution sensitivity arises out of an automatic System 1 process or whether it depends on the operation of an executive resource demanding System 2 process. Results showed that accuracy on the bat-and-ball problem clearly declined under cognitive load. However, both reduced response confidence and increased response latencies indicated that biased reasoners remained sensitive to their faulty responses under load. Results suggest that a crucial substitution monitoring process is not only successfully engaged, but that it automatically operates as an autonomous System 1 process. By signaling its doubt along with a biased intuition, it appears System 1 is “smarter” than traditionally assumed.",

A study was conducted to explore both a manual and assisted method for performing handoffs during manipulated contingency scenarios. The assisted handoff method allowed subjects to easily choose and group nominal and/or contingency vehicles. The number of contingencies was also manipulated to determine the effect workload had on how pilots utilized the ability to handoff vehicles. Results show subjects performed handoffs more often when there were more contingencies and when the assisted handoff tool was available. In addition, the assisted tool made subjects feel more comfortable, enabling them to feel like they could take longer to resolve contingency situations. Lastly, even during contingencies, subjects were able to successfully complete secondary tasks.",29

Two experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) to relieve the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation. In the first experiment, 35 participants completed N-back tasks at 8:00 a.m. for two consecutive days in a within-subject study. Then, the participants received either taVNS or earlobe stimulation (active control) intervention in two sessions at random orders after 24 h of sustained wakefulness. Then, they completed the N-back tasks again. In the second experiment, 30 participants completed the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and 32 completed the N-back tasks at 8:00 a.m. on the first and second days. Then, they received either taVNS or earlobe stimulation at random orders and finished the N-back and PVT tasks immediately after one hour. In Experiment 1, taVNS could significantly improve the accuracy rate of participants in spatial 3-back tasks compared to active control, which was consistent with experiment 2. However, taVNS did not specifically enhance PVT performance.

Existing workload pattern detection approaches suffer from two essential limitations which restrict their effectiveness in such environments. Specifically, they require massive human intervention, and are specific to particular types of workload data. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a generic workload pattern and periodicity detection technique that employs the prefix transposition approach from the molecular biology domain to detect workload periodicity in node-specific and aggregated cloud environments. The strengths of the proposed technique compared to the state of the art lie in its ability to be applied to any type of workload, and also to detect patterns of varying lengths, amplitudes, and shapes. Experiments conducted on cloud server nodes and aggregated CPU and throughput workload datasets collected from Information Technology (IT) and Telecom domains reveal that our solution improves the accuracy of the detections, especially in harsh environments, where the lengths, shapes, and amplitudes of patterns vary, as compared to the autocorrelation technique. Other findings show that the proposed approach is also highly efficient at detecting multiple short-term and long-term periodic patterns on any type of time series-based cloud computing workloads of different time granularity.",

The results show that there is a certain degree of correlation in the majority of the SPEC CPU2017 applications (79%). This observation differs from the SPEC CPU2006 in which the correlation of access behavior only exists in a small number of applications (27%).

As technology scales down, processing units become more susceptible to different types of faults due to radiations, manufacturing defects, wearout and aging. Some faults are detected and fixed before deployment, while others appear during infield operation. To address infield faults, continuous and periodic testing mechanisms are leveraged. In this paper, we propose a GPGPU-specific technique that takes advantage of a couple of GPGPU workloads characteristics to reduce the performance overhead of periodic testing. First, we show that many GPGPU workloads experience high probability of input similarity between threads of the same warp. Second, we show that GPGPU workloads have noticeable variation in the threads activity of their warps. Traditional periodic testing mechanisms, when applied to GPGPUs, fail to exploit these observations. Hence, we propose the half-SP deactivation technique to exploit these workload characteristics and reduce the performance overhead of the periodic testing in GPGPU platforms. The results show that the proposed technique can reduce the performance overhead of the testing from 29% to 8% with less than 1.8% area and power overheads.",

This study presented a stable Electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern over time. A data augmentation (DA) method and a deep neural network (NN) are developed accordingly based on the peculiarity of the EEG pattern for MW assessment. The EEG pattern consists of rhythmic energies in the Temporal–Spatial–Spectral domain, named energy tensor. The DA method for energy tensors is realized by randomly disrupting the temporal dimension which was certified to be irrelevant to MW levels in our previous study. The NN is designed based on deep transfer learning and Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (DS-CNN). Energy tensors after DA are used as the input of the proposed NN to construct MW classifiers and the entire operation is named transfer DS-CNN framework. The experiment results demonstrate that the optimal temporal resolution of EEG patterns for MW classification is 3.5 min. The transfer DS-CNN framework is effective enough to build a cross-session MW classifier for a specific subject in an average of 9.195 s, with an average prediction accuracy of 97.22%.

We adapt a set of well-known metaheuristics, including genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and water wave optimization (WWO), to solve this problem. Computational experiments on a variety of problem instances from real-world manufacturers show that the adapted WWO algorithm exhibits the best performance on both versions.",

Unlike previous studies, this research focused not only on the overall job satisfaction and job performance relationship but also provided enhanced insights into the relationship between employee satisfaction levels with different aspects of their jobs and the individual impacts of each of these on the employee’s overall job performance in a comprehensive manner by presenting the survey findings of 394 skilled laborers, engineers/architects, and managerial staff in the Turkish and North Cyprus construction markets. A further contribution of the current study is differentiating among various categories of construction professionals for potential approach variations in the analysis of the defined relationship. Both job satisfaction and job performance vary considerably based on different employee categories. The lowest job satisfaction and job performance were recorded by skilled laborers, while the greatest ones were recorded by engineers/architects, and there was a strong positive correlation between job satisfaction and performance across all respondent categories. Regression analysis findings revealed “workload conditions” as the only strong predictor of job performance existing in all three categories, indicating a need to reconsider the heavy workload tradition available in the construction industry. The distinct difference between the job satisfaction facets that predicted job performance in various employee categories was a noteworthy finding. This suggests that organizations may benefit from categorizing their employee groups, concentrating on each group’s distinct approach, and developing tailored strategies in response. Strikingly, numerous strong predictors of job performance identified in this research may be improved without significant investment, giving the organizations a competitive edge. This study provides a guide for construction organizations in identifying the key job satisfaction facets to prioritize while implementing tailored strategies to improve the job performance of three types of crucial construction professionals.",7

Teaching a kinematic behavior by demonstration and encoding it with dynamical systems that are robust with respect to perturbations, is proposed in order to address this issue. Given a kinematic behavior encoded by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), this work proposes a passive control scheme for assisting kinesthetic modifications of the learned behavior in task variations. It employs the utilization of penetrable spherical Virtual Fixtures (VFs) around the DMP’s virtual evolution that follows the teacher’s motion. The controller enables the user to haptically ‘inspect’ the spatial properties of the learned behavior in SE(3) and significantly modify it at any required segment, while facilitating the following of already learned segments. A demonstration within the VFs could signify that the kinematic behavior is taught correctly and could lead to autonomous execution, with the DMP generating the newly learned reference commands. The proposed control scheme is theoretically proved to be passive and experimentally validated with a KUKA LWR4+ robot. Results are compared with the case of using a gravity compensated robot agnostic of the previously learned task. It is shown that the time duration of teaching and the user’s cognitive load are reduced.",

Workload balancing among cells tends to increase CMS processing costs, and hence the use of multiobjective optimization methods is required for CMS solutions that are optimal and feasible.

Data glasses provide information directly in the field of view and could, therefore, reduce glances away from the roadway ahead to focus on the dashboard. This study aimed to examine whether providing information in data glasses while riding as compared to classical head down displays makes a difference. Therefore, a total of N = 24 riders completed the ISO lane change test on a motorcycle riding simulator. Meanwhile, riders had to react to changing turn-by-turn indications which were either displayed in the dashboard, in the data glasses or redundantly in both display technologies. The performance in the lane change test and the reaction times achieved in the secondary task were examined along with riders’ workload by means of the Detection Response Task (DRT) and questionnaire data. Results revealed that riders’ lane change performances did not differ between the conditions ‘data glasses’ and ‘dashboard’. Information displayed in the data glasses was recognized faster and fewer turn-by-turn indications were missed. The performance in the DRT remained unchanged throughout the test conditions, while the subjective workload experience decreased with the use of data glasses. Overall, the results suggest that data glasses did not provoke an attentional capture effect and were, therefore, not inferior compared to dashboards regarding riding performance. However, data glasses did reduce the perceived workload and may in particular provide a safety benefit when time-critical information, such as warnings, need to be displayed.",

A perception-driven situation awareness model is proposed and studied by implementing two distinct experimental protocols with different groups of participants. Results of a first study with a single-screen configuration are repeated by those of a second one on a multiple-screen context. Both experimental protocols rely on manipulating a between-subjects factor to compare two conditions - one with alarms activated synchronously with heart rate and one with alarms non-synchronized with heart rate - and a within-subjects factor to compare the impact of workload by increasing the level of task difficulty. Results about mono-screen and multi-screen configurations are homogenous. The synchronous condition makes people produce significantly more errors and fewer visual scans of the alarm display area. This degradation of perceptual abilities is non-conscious and is correlated with workload. Main people are not aware about their actual performance and this is confirmed by the evolution of subjective performance and frustration regarding task difficulty, display configuration and alarm activation condition. Such discrepancies between what it is looked at with what it is actually perceived and between actual and perceived indicators like performance are perceptual dissonances that are relevant for perception-driven situation awareness. The application of synchronizing dynamic events with heartbeats will be studied for different individual and collective work contexts in order to extend the proposed perception-driven situation awareness model based on perceptual dissonance management and on human capability parameters.",

The workload that a production machine undertakes influences its deterioration process and maintenance. Besides, different types of dependencies among production machines also influence the production and maintenance scheduling of manufacturing systems. Existing studies have not paid enough attention to the joint optimization of production and maintenance for make-to-order manufacturing systems considering different types of dependencies. In this paper, first, customer orders are predicted using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) according to their characteristics. Second, the model of daily working hours is proposed to represent the influence of customer orders on the deterioration process of production machines. Third, the reliability and imperfect maintenance models of production machines considering three types of dependencies are proposed, and the optimal maintenance time window (MTW) for opportunistic maintenance is obtained in order to minimize the maintenance cost. Fourth, the mathematical model of the entire cost of a new production line construction, covering maintenance cost, operators’ salary, and construction cost, is proposed, and the optimal construction time is obtained in order to minimize the entire cost. Finally, a real use case of the manufacturing system for the shell of air-conditioning compressor is given to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed model and method. The originality of this work lies in the consideration of the influence of customer orders on the deterioration process of production machines and the modelling of different types of dependencies among production machines in a single model.",

This could potentially cause mental stress in workplaces. Prolonged exposure to mental stress contributes to poor working experience and even severe health problems. Despite the growing demand, the existing intelligent stress detection methods are limited when applied to actual workplaces. They often measure physiological and physical signals, via intrusive devices, to detect stress. The intrusiveness hampers their accessibility and applicability in daily life and workplaces. To overcome that, behavior-based methods were proposed. Models that explore mouse and gaze behaviors during computer usages were demonstrated to be particularly effective. However, the current methods rely on using prior knowledge of the user interface (UI) layout to construct models. Their applicability thus is limited, especially in real workplaces where task UI is often dynamic. This paper presents a novel stress detection method to address the challenges. It attains non-intrusiveness and UI-agnostic by modeling the relative movement and coordination of mouse and gaze. The method is evaluated on a dynamic-UI task, namely, web searching. An accuracy of 78.8% is achieved using a commercial eye-tracker for gaze estimation, beating the state-of-the-art approaches by around 20%. We further use webcam to estimate gaze locations substituting for the eye-tracker, to enhance the model accessibility. The method yields 68.6% accuracy of stress detection without using any special devices. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our method. It opens up a new avenue for cognitive-aware adaptive user interface, intelligent working environment, and related applications.",

Wake vortices, generated by jet aircraft, pose a significant hazard to trailing or crossing aircrafts. Despite existing separation rules, incidents involving WVEs continue to occur, especially affecting smaller aircrafts like business jets, resulting in aircraft upsets and occasional cabin injuries. To address these challenges, the study focused on developing and validating an alert system that can be presented to air traffic controllers, enabling them to warn flight crews. This empowers the flight crews to either avoid the wake vortex or secure the cabin to prevent injuries. The research employed a multidimensional approach including an analysis of human performance and human factors (HF) issues to determine the potential impact of the alert on pilots' roles, tasks, and mental states. It also utilizes Human Assurance Levels (HALs) to evaluate the necessary human factors support based on the safety criticality of the new system. Realistic flight simulations were conducted to collect data of pilots' behavioural, subjective and neurophysiological responses during WVEs. The data allowed for an objective evaluation of the WVA impact on pilots' operation, behaviour and mental states (mental workload, stress levels and arousal). In particular, the results highlighted the effectiveness of the alert system in facilitating pilots' preparation, awareness and crew resource management (CRM). The results also highlighted the importance of avionics able to enhance aviation safety and reducing risks associated with wake vortex encounters.

Strategy 1: The discrete event simulation model in virtual space is updated when key parameters exceed the designed thresholds. Strategy 2: The simulated data used by clearing functions is updated after every production planning process. We fit clearing functions using both historical data and simulation prediction data.",10

Many current studies focus on the impacts of a single factor, such as physiological signal, lane changing, and so on, but these results are usually unsatisfactory due to the incapacity to account for other factors. In response, this work proposes a multi-factor quantification and analysis method to classify the driver's mental workload by incorporating physiological signal, traffic flow, and environment. For physiological signals, we use sensors to gather the driver's Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA). In order to quantify the traffic flow and environment, such as traffic volume, space headway, and weather. We use detection algorithms in images from the car's front and rear driving recorders in the real-world driving experiment on the expressway. Furthermore, we can estimate the distance between surrounding vehicles and the experimental vehicle using the detected car coordinates and camera parameters. This work then applies deep learning algorithms to classify the front driving recorder images into several weather classifications. Finally, the quantified multi-factor data can be utilized to classify the driver's mental workload. Drivers, on the other hand, annotate the data using the NASA Task Load Index Scale's results (NASA-TLX). In our experiments, we compare the classification results of single-factor and multi-factor data with three machine learning algorithms: neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF). The results demonstrate that for traffic volume and space headway from drive recorders, the detection performance of traffic volume in a monocular camera can reach up to 87.3%. Within sight distance, the accuracy of space headway can reach up to 87.1%. The RF algorithm achieves an outstanding classification result with strong stability by incorporating ECG, EDA, traffic flow, and environmental factors, and its classification accuracy achieves 97.8%. These findings further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multi-factor quantification and analysis method.",

Unobtrusive objective measures of mental workload (MWL) are therefore in high demand as indicated by both theory and practice. This pilot study explored the wearability and external validity of pupillometry, a MWL measure robustly validated in laboratory settings and now deployable in work settings demanding operator mobility. In an ecologically valid work environment, 21 participants performed two manual assemblies - one of low and one of high complexity - while wearing eye-tracking glasses for pupil size measurement. Results revealed that the device was perceived as fairly wearable in terms of physical and mental comfort. In terms of validity, no significant differences in mean pupil size were found between the assemblies even though subjective mental workload differed significantly. Exploratory analyses on the pupil size when attending to the assembly instructions only, were inconclusive. The present work suggests that current lab-based procedures might not be adequate yet for in-the-field mobile pupillometry. From a broader perspective, these findings also invite a more nuanced view on the current validity of lab-validated physiological MWL-measures when applied in real-life settings. We therefore conclude with some key insights for future development of mobile pupillometry.",

Submarines pose several unique challenges to fatigue mitigation, including requirements for continuous manning for long durations, a lack of access to critical environmental zeitgebers (stimuli pertinent to circadian physiology; e.g., natural sunlight), and work, rest and sleep occurring within an encapsulated environment. In this paper, we examine the factors that underlie fatigue in such a context with the aim of evaluating the predictive utility of a biomathematical model (BMM) of fatigue. Three experience sampling studies were conducted with submarine crews using a participant-led measurement protocol that included assessments of subjective sleepiness, workload (NASA-Task Load Index [TLX] and a bespoke underload-overload scale), and sleep. As expected, results indicated that predicting KSS with a BMM approach outperformed more conventional linear modelling approaches (e.g., time-of-day, sleep duration, time awake). Both the homeostatic and circadian components of the BMM were significantly associated with KSS and used as controls in the workload models. We found increased NASA-TLX workload was significantly associated with increased average KSS ratings at the between-person level. However, counter to expectations, the two workload measures were not found to have significant linear or quadratic relationship with fatigue at the within-person level. An important outcome of the research is that applied fatigue researchers should be extremely cautious applying conventional linear predictors when predicting fatigue. Practical implications for the submarine and related extreme work context are discussed. Important avenues for continued research are outlined, including directly estimating BMM parameters.",

In this work, we identify and formally define a new type of proactive attentional attacks called Informational Denial-of-Service (IDoS) attacks that generate a large volume of feint attacks to overload human operators and hide real attacks among feints. We incorporate human factors (e.g., levels of expertise, stress, and efficiency) and empirical psychological results (e.g., the Yerkes-Dodson law and the sunk cost fallacy) to model the operators’ attention dynamics and their decision-making processes along with the real-time alert monitoring and inspection. To assist human operators in dismissing the feints and escalating the real attacks timely and accurately, we develop a Resilient and Adaptive Data-driven alert and Attention Management Strategy (RADAMS) that de-emphasizes alerts selectively based on the abstracted category labels of the alerts. RADAMS uses reinforcement learning to achieve a customized and transferable design for various human operators and evolving IDoS attacks. The integrated modeling and theoretical analysis lead to the Product Principle of Attention (PPoA), fundamental limits, and the tradeoff among crucial human and economic factors. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed strategy outperforms the default strategy and can reduce the IDoS risk by as much as 20%. Besides, the strategy is resilient to large variations of costs, attack frequencies, and human attention capacities. We have recognized interesting phenomena such as attentional risk equivalency, attacker’s dilemma, and the half-truth optimal attack strategy.",

Theoretical frameworks explaining these dual-task interactions have been proposed and debated for decades. Therefore, we investigated postural control performance under different visual conditions using a virtual reality system, simultaneously measuring cortical activities with a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Twenty-four healthy participants were included in this study. Postural stability and cortical activities after perturbations were measured under several conditions consisting of postural and visual perturbations. The results showed that concurrent visual and postural perturbations could facilitate cortical activities in the supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobe. Additionally, visual distractors deteriorated postural control ability and cortical activation of the supplementary motor area. These findings supported the theoretical framework of the “Cross talk model”, in which concurrent tasks using similar neural domains can facilitate these task performances. Furthermore, it indicated that the cortical resource capacity and domains activated for information processing should be considered in experiments involving dual-task paradigms and training.",

Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen volunteer firefighters. Firefighters were asked about their experiences of sleep inertia and what strategies they use to manage sleep inertia when waking and responding to night calls. Results Firefighters perceive that the duration and risk of sleep inertia is less than what is commonly espoused in the literature. This presents a potential barrier to implementing sleep inertia countermeasures in this cohort. However, firefighters informally managed sleep inertia directly and indirectly. Several deliberate strategies to directly reduce sleep inertia (e.g., running to and from their car), and indirect strategies to manage the impact of sleep inertia (e.g., risk assessments) emerged. Moreover, it was identified that various aspects of the firefighting role have the potential to reduce sleep inertia through multifactorial physical and mental stimulation (e.g., through waking to the pager alarm and the cognitive demand of firefighting tasks). Conclusions The firefighting role can be inherently stimulating and has the potential to reduce the severity of sleep inertia for firefighters waking and responding to night calls. Regardless, informal strategies to manage sleep inertia could be incorporated into formal education procedures of organisations to improve the safety of firefighters. Relevance to industry Informal sleep inertia management strategies could be formalised to help educate less experienced firefighters on how to manage night-time calls and improve the safety of personnel in the firefighting industry.",

It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye-tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages.",

However, transaction performance and scalability has become the main challenges hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain. Due to its inability to meet the demands of high-frequency trading, blockchain cannot be adopted in many scenarios. To improve the transaction capacity, researchers have proposed some on-chain scaling technologies, including lightning networks, directed acyclic graph technology, state channels, and sharding mechanisms, in which sharding emerges as a potential scaling technology. Nevertheless, excessive cross-shard transactions and uneven shard workloads prevent the sharding mechanism from achieving the expected aim. This paper proposes a graph-based sharding scheme for public blockchain to efficiently balance the transaction distribution. By mitigating cross-shard transactions and evening-out workloads among shards, the scheme reduces transaction confirmation latency and enhances the transaction capacity of the blockchain. Therefore, the scheme can achieve a high-frequency transaction as well as a better blockchain scalability. Experiments results show that the scheme effectively reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio to a range of 35%–56% and significantly decreases the transaction confirmation latency to 6 s in a blockchain with no more than 25 shards.",3

As the AR HUD is vulnerable to be affected by changed ambient light, it weakens the legibility of the virtual interface and driver's visual comfort to a certain extent. The content color, as one of interface visual design elements, directly affects the performance of driver, which include the visual sensitivity and fatigue and further influences the vehicle safety. The selection between luminance contrast (affects sensitive and number of applicable environments) and driver performance (affects fatigue) are contradictory issues. In order to solve this contradictory problem in the design of AR HUD interface, and balance the cognitive load and situation awareness of driver, an extended analysis and optimization method of interface element was proposed. This method quantifies the discrete interface elements and makes the opposition problem consistent.

Relevant critical applications that benefit from such platforms, for instance autonomous driving, usually impose additional real-time requirements that must be met to guarantee the correctness of the systems. In this paper, we propose exploiting readily available and extensively validated techniques to model and analyze real-time systems with GPUs. Specifically, we propose a methodology to employ the MAST model to characterize such systems, and different variants of the Offset-Based Response-Time Analysis techniques to validate the real-time requirements. We verify our approach with a real industrial application sourced from the railway industry. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving synthetic and real task-sets, we characterize the applicability of the approach, and we also show how estimated worst-case response times are aligned with real measurements up to 87.2%.",

However, these benefits become less noticeable during off-nominal operations where aircraft are routinely interrupted from staying on PBN procedures due to disturbances such as missed approaches. This human-in-the-loop (HITL) study used multiple types of disturbance events to perturb the arrival schedule. Perturbed schedules were managed with different types of schedule adjustments, including a condition with no adjustments. The study collected data on a host of dependent variables, including human factors measures on controller workload and system performance measures such as schedule nonconformance (nc). Initial analyses showed strong correlations between aggregated controller workload and aggregated nc, as well as benefits of both automatic and manual schedule adjustments for increasing system performance, such as reduced PBN procedure interruptions. The goal of this paper is to further test these initial findings. The results indicated that an increase in schedule nonconformance correlated with an increase in controller workload at specific time intervals, and automated schedule adjustments consistently reduced controller workload associated with nonconformance.",

To date research has been conducted under the assumption that the relationship between the amount of resource allocated to a job and its processing time is independent of the number of tasks processed previously. However, there exist many manufacturing and service systems where workers and machines acquire, develop and refine skills through the repetition of identical or similar operations. In this paper we consider a scheduling model where job processing times are a convex function of the amount of resource they are allocated. In addition, we assume that the parameters of this function are position-dependent, i.e., vary with the job׳s position in the sequence. This assumption reflects general processes of learning or aging, or a combination of both. We first focus on a single machine setting and the makespan and total flowtime criteria. We show that the combined problem of finding an optimal job sequence and an optimal resource allocation can be solved in O(n3) time. We show that our algorithm can be used to address a bicriteria objective comprising of a linear combination of makespan and the total flowtime criteria on a single machine. We then extend the results to a parallel machine setting for the total flowtime criteria.",

The pupil dilation response (PDR) to noxious stimuli is thought to be a surrogate for LC responses, but PDR response to Peltier-controlled noxious heat stimuli, the most commonly used method in experimental pain research, has not been described. New method Healthy volunteers were presented with randomly presented heat stimuli of 5 sec duration and provided pain intensity ratings to each stimulus. Pupillometry was performed and a method developed to quantify the PDR relevant to these stimuli. The stimulus response, reliability, and effect of commonly used manipulations on pain experience were explored. Results A method of artifact removal and adjusting for lag from stimulus initiation to PDR response was developed, resulting in a close correlation between pain intensity rating and PDR across a large range of heat stimuli. A reliable assessment of PDR within an individual was achieved with fewer presentations as heat stimulus intensity increased. The correlation between pain rating and PDR was disrupted when cognitive load is increased by manipulating expectations or presenting a second pain stimulus. Comparison with existing methods The PDR began later after skin heating than electrical stimuli and this is the first examination of the PDR using standard nociceptive testing and manipulations of expectations and competing noxious stimulation. Conclusions A method is described applying PDR to standard heat nociceptive testing, demonstrating stimulus response, reliability, and disruption by cognitive manipulation.",

It was hypothesized that beneficial physiological effects would result by training with high eccentric workloads. Conventional rowing machines are utilized for performance improvements through concentric workloads alone; however for this research, a conventional machine was modified with an electric motor and an advanced control system to allow the machine to also include eccentric capabilities. The ability to combine concentric and eccentric actions in any exercise has the potential to improve training effectiveness. The study followed an experimental design, exposing ten subjects (5 male, 5 female) to multiple eccentric workloads generated by the powered rowing machine. Each subject participated in two 12-min exercise trials corresponding to full body row (FBR) and low body row (LBR). Each of these trials included four 3-min stages that gradually increased the eccentric workload. Increased eccentric muscle contractions and metabolic cost were confirmed in the experiments. The results on oxygen consumption reveal a significant increase between stages 1 and 2 for both exercises (FBR p=0.0001 and LBR p=0.004) with no significant increases between the remaining stages. Results on heart rate reveal a significantly increase with each stage for both exercises (p<0.05).

Mental workload depends on numerous factors: task difficulty, task complexity, level of traffic, additional activities required by the driving action or imposed by the driver, the contextual conditions, as well as the individual response to stress. The study of driver's workload is crucial in guiding future car design, in order to improve the user experience, comfort as well as driving performance and safety. Indeed, if task demands are too high in relation to the user's capabilities, errors may occur and may become critical for safety. The present paper defines a transdisciplinary approach based on monitoring the driver's workload during driving tasks in order to map the perceived user experience, and finally understand the interaction between the driver and the car systems. The approach is based on three layers: the human conditions to detect, the vital parameters to be monitored, and the adopted monitoring technologies. The paper proposes: a protocol to monitor the driver's workload during both real and simulated tasks, a technological set-up including physiological and performance data collection, and a proper data elaboration strategy. The key findings are: the selection of the most relevant subjective and objective parameters to measure the driver's mental workload, the definition of a preliminary technological set-up for monitoring the workload during simulated driving, and the evaluation of the effects of task complexity and of a secondary task on driver's performance. The research paved the way to further studies about how to miniaturize and embed sensors inside the car for a less intrusive application during real driving.

However, the specific role of frontal structures in planning is unclear. We used a novel and ecological task, that allowed us to separate the planning period from the execution period. The spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG recordings showed that planning induced a progressive and sustained increase of frontal-midline theta activity (FMθ) over time. Source analyses indicated that this activity was generated within the prefrontal cortex. Theta activity from the right mid-Cingulate Cortex (MCC) and the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) were correlated with an increase in the time needed for elaborating plans. On the other hand, left Frontopolar cortex (FP) theta activity exhibited a negative correlation with the time required for executing a plan. Since reaction times of planning execution correlated with correct responses, left FP theta activity might be associated with efficiency and accuracy in making a plan. Associations between theta activity from the right MCC and the left ACC with reaction times of the planning period may reflect high cognitive demand of the task, due to the engagement of attentional control and conflict monitoring implementation. In turn, the specific association between left FP theta activity and planning performance may reflect the participation of this brain region in successfully self-generated plans.",

Methods A 2k (k = 3) factorial experiment with factors namely, hazardous scenario, activity level, and trial was designed and conducted to demonstrate the proposed assessment approach. Throughout the experiment, we recorded the eye movements of 12 EOT crane operators of a steel industry of authors’ country.

In this study, a mathematical model to quantitatively compute the multiple sources of workload with a cognitive architecture, Adaptive Control of Thought – Rationale (ACT-R), is proposed, which at the same time reflects the effect of time pressure. Specifically, mathematical equations were developed to quantify each subscale of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the time pressure effect on information processing speed. The proposed method not only successfully estimates each subscale of NASA-TLX but also simulates the change of human performance and workload by time pressure, comparing the simulated values by the proposed method to performance time by the experiment and subjective ratings of NASA-TLX, as measured by participants on an experiment in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air Traffic Control (KA-ATC) task.

A cross-sectional study with 267 forest workers in rural properties in the Brazilian Central region was used. The following evaluations were performed for each of the activities (felling, delimbing, tracing, manual extraction and manual loading): physical workload evaluation; biomechanical evaluation; risk of repetitive strain injuries/work-related musculoskeletal disorders; environmental noise and vibration factors, where relevant, and thermal overload through the Wetbulb Globe Temperature index. The results showed that in general the physical workload was very high, exceeding the cardiovascular load limits and adding to the need for work reorganization. All activities exposed workers to serious and imminent risks of developing injuries to the spine and lower limbs. Likewise, in general the risk of the appearance of RSI/WMSDs was very high for all activities evaluated. Such results are due to the combination of organizational work factors and factors of the work environment such as exposure to bad weather, uneven terrain, lifting and handling loads above tolerable limits, excessive noise and thermal overload. All of this allows to conclude that ergonomic risks and workers’ health hazards in forest harvesting in rural properties are latent and very worrying, and that these workers are exposed to a form of labor exploitation that invariably leads to physical and emotional exhaustion and therefore to their decreased labor capacity and useful working life.",

In order to get the sufficient level of performance, arrangement of workloads is necessary. Rapid growth in data, maximum functionality and changing behavior tends the database workload to be more complex and tricky. Each DBMS experiences complex workloads that are difficult to manage by the humans; human experts take much time to manage database workload efficiently; even in some cases it may become impossible and leads toward malnourishment. This problem leads database practitioners, vendors and researchers toward new challenges. To achieve a satisfactory level of performance, either Database Administrator (DBA) or DBMSs must have the knowledge about the workload shifts. Efficient execution and resource allocation of workload is dependent on the workload type that may be either On Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support System (DSS).

Researches show electrocardiogram (ECG) physiological signals can be an appropriate indicator to reflect the level of human MW. When the operator is in the state of high MW, the cardiac load will increase, and the period and shape of ECG signals accordingly change. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the most widely used ECG feature to assess the MW. However, its classification precision is not high enough. In order to improve this, multiple features of ECG signals are extracted to classify the MW in this paper. Besides the RR interval feature of HRV, the other three features, T and P wave power, QRS complex power and Sample Entropy (SampEn) of ECG waveform, are further extracted and applied to assess MW. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to establish the classification model, and the grid search and cross-validation algorithm are used to optimize its parameters.

This device can measure electro-oculography, acceleration, and angular rate without load on the subject. The computer game widely known as TETRIS is selected as a test task because the task difficulty affecting the subjects’ workload can be controlled by varying game speed. NASA-TLX is utilized to measure the subjective mental workload of 12 subjects. First, the blink rate measured by JINS MEME focusses as a parameter to reflect mental workload. Consequently, 10 out of 12 subjects show negative correlation between blink rate and NASA-TLX score. Thus, basic validity using this device to estimate mental workload is confirmed. Second, a machine algorithm, i.e., a support vector machine (SVM), is applied to the measured data to categorize the subject’s conditions into either Normal or Degraded. Additional parameters measured by JINS MEME are introduced as input data to the SVM. It is demonstrated that the SVM can categorize the subjects’ conditions with 80-90% accuracy, and that the reduction of input variables using principle component analysis results in higher categorization accuracy.",19

While numerous investigations have examined the relationship between motor behavior and mental workload or self-efficacy in a performance context, a fairly limited effort focused on the combined examination of these notions during learning. Thus, this study aimed to examine their concomitant dynamics during the learning of a novel reaching skill practiced throughout multiple sessions. Individuals had to learn to control a virtual robotic arm via a human-machine interface by using limited head motion throughout eight practice sessions while motor performance, mental workload, and self-efficacy were assessed. The results revealed that as individuals learned to control the robotic arm, performance improved at the fastest rate, followed by a more gradual reduction of mental workload and finally an increase in self-efficacy. These results suggest that once the performance improved, less cognitive-motor resources were recruited, leading to an attenuated mental workload. Considering that attention is a primary cognitive resource driving mental workload, it is suggested that during early learning, attentional resources are primarily allocated to address task demands and not enough are available to assess self-efficacy. However, as the performance becomes more automatic, a lower level of mental workload is attained driven by decreased recruitment of attentional resources. These available resources allow for a reliable assessment of self-efficacy resulting in a subsequent observable change. These results are also discussed in terms of the application to the training and design of assistive technologies.",

Their finding of common intuitive concern with care and fairness supports the two-foundation perspective. In two high-powered preregistered experiments (N = 3275), we used time-pressure to induce intuitive thinking and tested Wright and Baril's finding that “we are all liberals at heart.” Although the manipulations worked as intended, Study 1 failed to identify an effect on the moral foundations questionnaire (MFQ). We conjectured that familiarity with standard survey items may weaken intuition manipulations by eliciting stable opinions.

Thirty-six volunteers were enrolled to participate into a driving simulator-based experiment. Each participant was required to complete twelve trials of simulated driving under different sets of scenarios. Driving outcome was measured by five dependent variables: frequency of speeding, frequency of lane deviations, number of correct sign recognition, completion time and workload. The results showed the frequency of speeding was significantly affected by weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density. Lighting condition had a significant effect on number of correct sign recognition. Weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density had significant effects on task completion time.

A full model describing the relationship between the workload and the selected important measurements is then trained via a support vector regression model. Real driving data of 10 participants, comprising 15 measured physiological and vehicle-state variables are used for the purpose of validation.

In this paper, we explore how 2–5-year-old children’s comprehension of negation changes depending on the context in which a negative sentence occurs. We collected eye-tracking data while children watched a video in which they heard positive and negative sentences. Negative sentences, such as “look at the boy with no apples,” referred to a boy with nothing (Experiment 1) or a boy with an alternative object (Experiment 2). All children showed greater difficulty in resolving the referent when negative sentences referred to the boy with nothing, despite suggestions that nonexistence negations of this type are produced early in development. In addition, 3- and 4-year-old children showed an initial tendency to look away from the target and towards the named noun when the referent of the negative utterance was an alternative object. We argue that the processing of negation in young children is influenced by the cognitive demands of the pragmatic context in which the negative utterance occurs.",

The company distributes its products partitioning the service region into delivery zones or districts that are served by a single deliveryman. Two objectives are considered when designing the delivery zones: balance the workload associated with each zone, and the minimization of the customers’ waiting times (latency). The former objective concerns a districting decision, and the latter objective is related to a routing decision. To support these planning decisions, an optimization framework based on a novel bi-objective optimization model is proposed. To approximate the frontier of non-dominated solutions of the bi-objective problem, an efficient heuristic algorithm inspired in the ε-constraint method is developed. The proposed algorithm exploits the characteristics of the problem, and it is used to solve a real case study. Obtained results are compared with the current solution employed by the company. Both objective function values are improved by any of the solutions in the approximated Pareto front. To show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, an additional set of instances derived from the case study is tested. The results indicate that the algorithm is able to approximate the Pareto fronts despite their shape. Hence, interesting managerial insights to improve the current decisions of the company are provided derived from the computational experiments.",

The focus of this paper is on multi-period optimization models for order release planning. We use a simulation study of a make to order manufacturer in a rolling horizon setting and compare the performance of an order release model that assumes fixed lead times and a model that allows for variable lead times: An input output control and a clearing function model, respectively. We analyze two different approaches to cope with the varying and tight due date slack and find that including more foreknowledge of demand is preferable. Finally, we show that the clearing function model outperforms the input output control model in all scenarios by yielding lower inventory levels with shorter shop floor throughput times. This advantage seems not to be affected by the predictability of the demand, but the IOC model narrows the gap when using near optimal parameters especially for a scenario with deterministic demand.",

Shape adjustment must be made to meet the surface precision requirement of space missions by changing the lengths of adjustable cables. It is desirable to find the optimum adjustment amount based on the current state of the actual prototype. However, it is hard to build an accuracy simulation model reflecting mechanical behavior of the actual prototype because only part information about the actual prototype can be measured. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with the parameter uncertainty of the actual prototype in order to provide a reliable structure state to guide the shape adjustment. This field has not been well studied because it involves an uncertainty analysis of parameters and the nonlinearity of high coupling of node displacements. To improve the efficiency of shape adjustment of uncertain mesh reflectors, this paper combines finite element model, actual prototype, and machine learning algorithm to develop a prediction model for precision analysis of the mesh reflector under multi-uncertainties using a machine learning algorithm (extreme gradient boosting), with the reflector surface node position as the input and the cable length adjustment amount required to displace it to a high precision surface as the output. First, based on the nominal design model, the sample data is collected by the Latin hypercube design method; the nonlinearity of the structure was taken into account by iterative solution during the data sampling, and the uncertain models containing different random errors are fused from the perspective of data sampling. The Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to obtain the optimal hyperparameters that enables strong generalization of the prediction model. Next, learning from the idea of K-nearest neighbor algorithm, the prediction model is updated based on the actual prototype data, which further improves the prediction ability of the current prototype to be adjusted. The incremental learning algorithm is used to reduce the time-consuming of the prediction model updating. Finally, numerical examples and experiments show that the proposed method has higher adjustment efficiency and precision with less workload.",

The robot needs to interact with the human to perform the target task while relieving the user from the workload. To do that, the robot should be able to recognize the human's intentions and guarantee safe and adaptive behavior along the intended motion directions. The robot-control strategies with such attributes are particularly demanded in the industrial field, where the operator guides the robot manually to manipulate heavy parts (e.g., while teaching a specific task). With this aim, this work proposes a Q-Learning-based Model Predictive Variable Impedance Control (Q-LMPVIC) to assist the operators in a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) tasks. A Cartesian impedance control loop is designed to implement a decoupled compliant robot dynamics. The impedance control parameters (i.e., setpoint and damping parameters) are then optimized online in order to maximize the performance of the pHRC. For this purpose, an ensemble of neural networks is designed to learn the modeling of the human-robot interaction dynamics while capturing the associated uncertainties. The derived modeling is then exploited by the model predictive controller (MPC), enhanced with the stability guarantees by means of Lyapunov constraints. The MPC is solved by making use of a Q-Learning method that, in its online implementation, uses an actor-critic algorithm to approximate the exact solution. Indeed, the Q-learning method provides an accurate and highly efficient solution (in terms of computational time and resources). The proposed approach has been validated through experimental tests, in which a Franka EMIKA panda robot has been used as a test platform. Each user was asked to interact with the robot along the controlled vertical z Cartesian direction. The proposed controller has been compared with a model-based reinforcement learning variable impedance controller (MBRLC) previously developed by some of the authors in order to evaluate the performance. As highlighted in the achieved results, the proposed controller is able to improve the pHRC performance. Additionally, two industrial tasks (a collaborative assembly and a collaborative deposition task) have been demonstrated to prove the applicability of the proposed solution in real industrial scenarios.",

Unfortunately, organizational NIDS solutions can often generate tens or hundreds of thousands of alerts on a daily basis, with a significant part of them having low importance or being false positives. Therefore, high priority alerts become hard to spot, which overloads security analysts and complicates their work. The current paper addresses this problem and introduces a machine learning framework for classifying NIDS alerts with the help of stream clustering and supervised learning. We propose a stream-clustering-guided method for creating labeled NIDS alert data sets. The small data sets created using this method can be used for training high-performance supervised NIDS alert classifiers. This significantly reduces the human labeling effort and eases the application of supervised machine learning for NIDS alert classification. The proposed machine learning framework was evaluated on NIDS alerts collected over 2 months from the network of a large academic organization. The experimental results indicate that combining stream clustering and supervised learning into a NIDS alert classification framework significantly decreases the number of false positives, and thus reduces the workload of human security analysts. The framework also features low CPU time and memory consumption and can thus be run on commodity hardware. In conclusion, the proposed framework provides a cost-effective means of integrating machine learning into Security Operation Centers (SOCs). This enables the identification of critical NIDS alerts using high-performance classifiers, thereby assisting in the automation of alert handling tasks for SOC personnel. To address the lack of public data sets in the problem domain and foster further research, we publicly share the large labeled NIDS alert data set used in our experimental setup.",

However, renewables are largely intermittent and can, negatively affect users’ applications and their performance, therefore, the profit of the service providers. Furthermore, services could be offered from those geographical locations where electricity is relatively cheaper than other locations; which may degrade the applications’ performance and potentially increase users’ costs. To ensure larger providers’ profits and lower users’ costs, certain non-interactive workloads could be either: moved and executed in geographical locations offering the lowest energy prices; or could be queued and delayed to execute later (in day or night time) when renewables, such as solar and wind energies, are at peak. However, these may have negative impacts on the energy consumption, workloads performance, and users’ costs. Therefore, to ensure energy, performance and cost efficiencies, appropriate workload scheduling, placement, migration, and resource management techniques are required to mange the infrastructure resources, workloads, and energy sources. In this paper, we propose a workload placement and three different migration policies that maximize the providers’ revenues, ensure the workload performance, reduce energy consumption, along with reducing ecological impacts and users’ costs. Using real workload traces and electricity prices for several geographical locations and distributed, heterogeneous, datacenters, our experimental evaluation suggest that the proposed approaches could save significant amount of energy (∼15.26%), reduces service monetary costs (∼0.53% - ∼19.66%), improves (∼1.58%) or, at least, maintains the expected level of applications’ performance, and increases providers’ revenue along with environmental sustainability, against the well-known first fit (FF), best fit (BF) heuristic algorithms, and other closest rivals.",

The present study tested the hypothesis that it reflects a modality and/or frequency specific mechanism. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (64 channels) were performed on 18 healthy subjects during visual, auditory, somatosensory, and pain oddball paradigms. Low- and high-frequency α-rhythm were analyzed on individual basis, and their sources were estimated by low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). α-ERD, served as an index of cortical activation, was computed on the cortical voxel level and compared across the conditions (target vs. non-target), α sub-bands (lower vs. higher frequency), and modalities (visual, auditory, somatosensory, and pain). The results showed that visual α-ERD was mainly generated from occipital cortex for both target and non-target conditions. Its magnitude was enhanced across widespread cortical regions (e.g., bilateral occipital, parietal, and frontal areas) in the target condition and was greater in high-frequency α-band. Finally, α-ERD difference between target and non-target conditions was not higher in visual than that in other control modalities. All these findings indicated that human high-frequency α-ERD reflects cognitive attention processes underlying reaction to oddball target stimuli regardless of stimulus modality.",

A fundamental, unresolved question is whether these fluctuations are ongoing and thus persist during task engagement, or alternatively, are quenched and replaced by task-related activations. Here, we examined this issue in the human visual cortex, using fMRI. Participants were asked to either perform a recognition task of randomly appearing face and non-face targets (attended condition) or watch them passively (unattended condition). Importantly, in approximately half of the trials, all sensory stimuli were absent. Our results show that even in the absence of stimuli, spontaneous fluctuations were suppressed by attention. The effect occurred in early visual cortex as well as in fronto-parietal attention network regions. During unattended trials, the activity fluctuations were negatively linked to pupil diameter, arguing against attentional fluctuations as underlying the effect. The results demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations do not remain unchanged with task performance, but are rather modulated according to behavioral and cognitive demands.",

At the current level of automation, the mixed right-of-control of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) with partial human involvement is of interest. This study investigates the factors affecting the successful take over of the control by a human driver in the conditionally automated vehicle upon operational design domain (ODD) exit under different sociodemographic, mental workload, traffic flow, weather, and lighting conditions. Data collected in Virtual and Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE) are used to study the successful taking of control back from automated driving. Apart from estimating the binary and mixed logit models, a latent structure was developed to incorporate the attitudinal indicators in the integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model. Results indicate that almost 80 percent of participants were successful in safely regaining control. However, participants with more sensitive attitudes about CAV safety, were more likely to fail. Heavy congestion positively impacts situational awareness in taking back control safely from a CAV. Moreover, multi-tasking based on non-driving related secondary task (NDRT) engagement in a rainy night scenario, mental workload, and reaction time were significantly positive indicators of unsafe control transition. The statistics suggest that the driver's familiarity with the concept of CAVs is not enough for the safe transition of control.",

In this context, working memory is defined as the short-term and temporary storage of information related to near future events to ensure the seamless execution of construction tasks. Although a strong relationship between engineering information format and task performance has been observed in the relevant literature, there remains an obvious theoretical disagreement—in particular, about the cognitive mechanisms for explaining why different information formats affect working memory development and retrieval in distinct ways. This study presents a human–subject experiment (n = 120) to examine the impact of information format on the performance of a pipe maintenance task, and the implications of cognitive costs in both working memory development (information encoding) and retrieval (information recalling). Participants were required to review the operational instructions for a pipe maintenance task for a short period, and then perform the task from memory. Participants were divided into four groups depending on the format of information they received: 2D isometric drawing of the plate heat exchanger with bulleted-text operational instructions (2D-simple group); 2D isometric drawing of the plate heat exchanger with rich-text operational instruction (2D-complex group); an interactive 3D model of the plate heat exchanger with bulleted-text operational instructions (3D group); or an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment with bulleted-text operational instructions (VR group). The results indicated that 3D and VR groups outperformed 2D-simple and 2D-complex groups in both operation time and maintenance accuracy. A further cognitive load analysis (based on surveys and pupil dilation) suggested that the superior performance of these groups is driven by more efficient usage of working memory, measured by how easily the encoded information can be recalled in the operation phase. Larger pupil dilation during encoding, indicative of successful working memory formation, was associated with better subsequent performance. These findings provide more evidence about cognitive mechanisms engaged by different information formats, help to resolve the current theoretical disagreement within the construction literature, and may inspire designs of cognition-driven information systems that can improve working memory in construction workers.",

Susceptibility to garden paths is sensitive to the availability of cognitive resources. These phenomena are well-explained by a Bayesian model in which humans stochastically update a sample-based representation of the posterior over a compositional hypothesis space.

These impair the ability for humans to successfully take over control. In this study, situation awareness prompts were used as a way to keep controllers cognitively engaged during their supervision of a fully automated ATC system.

However, in general, ground-fixed camera systems (GCS) have issues regarding the quality of the images, i.e., frequent image switching and insufficient viewpoint adjustment. Toward solving these problems, this study proposes a fundamental design method for a video presentation system using multiple flying cameras and investigates teleoperators' responses in terms of behavioral and mental aspects. The teleoperators need to rapidly understand the environment and precisely control the machine, so the video presentation system requires continuity to project consistent images by avoiding frequent changes in capturing parameters. It also requires complementarity between images to provide three-dimensional (3D) information with less mental rotation and translation. To investigate the feasibility of the framework of a multi-flying camera system (FCS), we implemented a prototype and ran experiments in which a construction machine in a virtual reality simulator moves over uneven terrain and carries objects. We found that FCS could reduce the work time and subjective workload and increase the subjective usability compared to a conventional GCS. Moreover, we could obtain the gaze distribution and view transition characteristics as well as their individual differences.

Due to the capabilities of smart objects to share their contents and interact with their social networks, the combined Social Internet of Educational Things (SIoET) for smart education is expected to provide users with more efficient services. The primary objective of this paper is to provide an efficient resource management by adopting edge intelligence technique for higher education system workloads on next-generation networks. As the number of tasks handled by these interconnected devices continues to rise, there is an escalating concern regarding resource competition and power consumption within the network. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an innovative edge intelligence-based resource allocation approach to intelligently allocate resources while minimizing latency and optimizing power consumption with increasing task volumes. The problem is dissected into two core sub-problems: computation resource optimization and power optimization. Leveraging the concept of Lagrangian and Bisection methods, our proposed algorithm, implemented within a Device-to-Device (D2D) -assisted edge intelligence network, demonstrates remarkable performance improvements. Network latency and energy consumption is reduced by up to 57.9 % and 82.3 % compared to the benchmark schemes.

Model-based flight simulation serves as our data source for landing risk analysis under uncertainties. A digital pilot in the loop that reflects the human piloting behaviors is employed to facilitate simulation efficiency. Eight types of unsafe events in landing are identified from statistics. On this basis, the landing safety boundary is extracted via stochastic simulation to divide safety and hazardous flight status domains, which contributes to flight status management and risk warning. The simulation results indicate that appropriate piloting behavior, which is active response and fast target acquisition with minimum overshoot and fluctuation, shows benefit to landing safety. The subset simulation technique is employed to further refine the boundary with less computational workload. Furthermore, the effect of airspeed, windspeed, and other factors on landing risk is also discussed.

Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) belong to this class of manufacturing systems. A profit-based objective function is considered. Clearing functions are used in the planning formulation to correctly represent the lead time behavior in the case of a congested system. Order acceptance decisions are made with respect to flexible due dates, i.e., it is possible to reject certain orders if there is not enough capacity. Such acceptance decisions are important, for instance, in short-term demand supply matching algorithms that are crucial for demand fulfillment and available to promise decisions in semiconductor manufacturing. The resulting planning problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. We first show that the resulting planning problem is NP-hard. Hence, computationally tractable approaches must be designed. Therefore, variable neighborhood search is hybridized with linear programming to solve large-sized problem instances in reasonable amount of computing time in the present paper. Results of computational experiments for problem instances that are derived from a scaled-down wafer fab simulation model are provided and analyzed.

Especially for the area of unmanned aviation, driven by the rise in drones, having human controllers might become unfeasible. One of the methods that is currently being investigated for replacing the conflict resolution task of Air Traffic Control is Reinforcement Learning. As violation of the required separation margins, also called an intrusion, is an event of relatively low frequency, using Reinforcement Learning for this task comes with difficulties that can potentially be attributed to data imbalance. This paper artificially increased the traffic density during the training phase of the Reinforcement Learning method to investigate what the importance is of a balanced data set on the performance of the Reinforcement Learning method. It was found that as the traffic density increased, the Reinforcement Learning methods started to outperform the analytical methods. Beyond this it was found that methods trained at higher traffic densities, but tested at lower traffic densities, outperformed the methods trained at that specific density. This indicates that it might be better to always ensure that the training scenarios are more complex than anticipated during the execution phase, even if that results in unrealistic scenarios.",

This is a new challenge to the production scheduling of the production line, which requires a faster and smarter response to changes in production demand. To meet the challenge, the reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) has emerged as a competitive and promising manufacturing model. The reconfigurable assembly system (RAS), a critical feature of RMS, can be seamlessly incorporated into multi-variety, variable-batch, multi-functional, and fast-delivery manufacturing modes, opening up the possibility of rapid changes for production scheduling. In this paper, we first build a RAS model that can more accurately represent scheduling problems that may occur in real-world industrial operations. More specifically, we consider the assembly process of products could be divided into a number of major steps which are performed in different stations and optimize the assembly sequence of products and the equipment selection within individual assembly stations. After that, three objective functions corresponding to the workload balance, reconfiguration/assembly cost, and lead time are proposed to jointly optimize the assembly sequence and the equipment selection in individual assembly stations. Finally, a hybrid particle swarm optimization (MOHPSO) method is utilized to solve the multiple-objective optimization problem, which combines the advantages of particle swarm optimization and the hybrid method. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed MOHPSO method over other alternatives including MOPSO and NSGA-II, achieving lower Spacing Metric (SM) and Mean Ideal Distance (MID) indexes and is suitable for solving production scheduling problems.",

Methods ISTHMUS is the consecutive acquisition of short-TE PRESS (32 transients) and long-TE HERCULES (224 transients) data with dual-TE water reference scans. Voxels were positioned in the centrum semiovale, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral thalamus regions. After acquisition, ISTHMUS data were separated into the PRESS and HERCULES portions for analysis and modeled separately using Osprey. In vivo experiments were performed in 10 healthy volunteers (6 female; 29.5±6.6 years). Each volunteer underwent two scans on the same day. Differences in metabolite measurements were examined. T2 correction based on the dual-TE water integrals were compared with: 1) T2 correction based on the default white matter and gray matter T2 reference values in Osprey and 2) shorter WM and GM T2 values from recent literature. Results No significant difference in linewidth was observed between PRESS and HERCULES. Bilateral thalamus spectra had produced significantly higher (p<0.001) linewidth compared to the other three regions. Linewidth measurements were similar between scans, with scan-to-scan differences under 1 Hz for most subjects. Paired t-tests indicated a significant difference only in PRESS NAAG between the two thalamus scans (p=0.002). T2 correction based on shorter T2 values showed better agreement to the dual-TE water integral ratio. Conclusions ISTHMUS facilitated data acquisition and post-processing and reduced operator workload to eliminate potential human error.",

According to cognitive visuo-motor theory, the human eye movements are a rich source of information about the human intention and behavior. According to Beatty's study, a task-evoked pupillary response is a consistent index of the human cognitive load and attention. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for a human's implicit intention recognition based on the eyeball movement pattern and pupil size variation. Based on the Bernard's research, we classify the human's implicit intention during a visual stimulus as informational and navigational intent. In the present study, the navigational intent refers to the human's idea to find some interesting objects in a visual input without a particular goal while the informational intent refers to the human's aspiration to find a particular object of interest. The proposed model utilizes the salient features of the eye such as fixation length, fixation count and pupil size variation as the inputs to classify the human's implicit intention. The experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve plausible recognition performance.",

The control circuit interface of the Chemical and Volume Control system (RCV) was redesigned based on some human factor criterions and it was compared to the original interface during the procedure of system boots. The multi-index evaluation method based on performance measures (i.e., time to complete and error rate), subjective rating (i.e., NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)) and physiological measure (i.e., eye movement) was used to evaluate MWL of operators. Twenty-two engineering students tested both interfaces in randomized order. The results showed that interface design has a significant effect on operators’ MWL. Specifically, the redesigned interface was rated significantly lower in overall workload, time to complete, and fixation indices, but higher blink rate.

The human ability to differentiate sound direction implies that spatial audio may be used to encode information. Therefore, it is hypothesized that spatial audio cues can be applied to aid differentiation of critical versus noncritical verbal auditory information. We used a human performance model and a laboratory study involving 24 participants to examine the effect of applying a notional, automated parser to present audio in a particular ear depending on information relevance. Operator workload and performance were assessed while subjects listened for and responded to relevant audio cues associated with critical information among additional noncritical information. Encoding relevance through spatial location in a spatial audio display system--as opposed to monophonic, binaural presentation--significantly reduced response time and workload, particularly for noncritical information. Future auditory displays employing spatial cues to indicate relevance have the potential to reduce workload and improve operator performance in similar task domains. Furthermore, these displays have the potential to reduce the dependence of workload and performance on the number of audio cues.",

Concurrently, the advancement of autonomous driving technologies reduces driver engagement, inadvertently eroding their proficiency. Integrating human cognitive flexibility and experiential insight with the machine’s precision and reliability offers a promising approach for the transitional phase towards fully automated driving. This study presents a human-machine collaboration approach to enhance the highly automated vehicles’ high-level flexibility and personalization attribute without the need for passengers’ prior driving experience. Firstly, we propose a tactical human–vehicle collaboration framework leveraging the hand-landmark extraction algorithm and augmented visual feedback. The proposed vision-based interface projects the gesture onto the ground and feeds it back to the driver through the augmented reality head-up display (AR-HUD) for intuitive interaction. The projection offers strategic decision-making guidance and planning recommendations for the vehicle. Utilizing these suggestions, the automation algorithm efficiently manages the remaining tasks, including collision avoidance and adherence to traffic regulations. This approach minimizes the driver’s engagement in routine driving tasks and negates the need for driving skills. Incorporating cooperative game theory, the methodology optimally balances personalization with system robustness. Finally, we compare our approach with conventional manual driving schemes that both can assist the self-driving car in avoiding unknown obstacles and reaching the personalized goal. Results demonstrate that the proposed decision-making and planning collaboration scheme significantly reduces human physical burdens without compromising driving performance and driver mental workloads.",

Most existing research in AR-based wayfinding has focused on the technological aspects of developing AR-based software or devices to realize navigation. No previous investigations have focused on understanding the impact of immersive augmented reality (IAR)–based systems on human wayfinding performance from the cognitive perspective. Aimed at investigating the influence of IAR-based systems on people’s cognitive map development and their subsequent wayfinding performance as well as the effect of using three-dimensional (3D) layout models in IAR environments in addition to superimposed guideposts, an experiment was carried out in a building with a complex floor plan. A total of 54 university students were evenly divided into three groups: a control group with no IAR assistance, a second group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes only superimposed guideposts, and a third group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes both guideposts and a 3D layout model. Each participant was asked to conduct a spatial exploration task in the environment, sketch a floor map based on their spatial cognition, and perform a wayfinding task to find eight specific locations in the building. An analysis of the participants’ performance and responses to a number of self-evaluation questionnaires collected in the experiment indicates that IAR technology can help people develop their cognitive maps more effectively and can substantially improve their wayfinding performance with a much lower workload. A second finding is that adding a 3D layout model can enhance the effect of an IAR-based navigation system in terms of cognitive map development. The findings from this research extend the existing knowledge about IAR-based navigation and further verify that AR technology has the potential to reduce human workload for cognitive tasks. The results also could support its more effective application in various scenarios that require assisted wayfinding and cognitive map training, such as emergency evacuation drills.",

To shorten lead times, it is permitted to start production at upstream stages without confirmed orders, hold semi-finished items within the system as make-to-stock, and then match orders to these items under the constraints of specifications and quantities. Eight make-to-stock policies are prepared by combining buffer selection rules, matching acceptance rules, and make-to-stock replenishment rules. Their performance is evaluated via computer simulation. In the case of relatively limited capacity, aggressively matching orders to make-to-stock items are preferable in terms of the average lateness of orders and the average inventory level of the make-to-stock items.

In this paper, we estimate the workload during the multitasking mental activities of human subjects. The estimation of mental workload is done using the “STEW” dataset [16]. The dataset consists of two tasks, namely “No task” and “simultaneous capacity (SIMKAP)-based multitasking activity”. Different workload levels of two tasks have been estimated using the composite framework consists of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and deep neural network. GWO has been used to select optimized features related to mental activities. Other optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are generally slower compared to the convergence rate of GWO. A deep hybrid model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been proposed for the classification of workload levels. The proposed deep model achieves 86.33% and 82.57% classification accuracy for “No task” and “SIMKAP-based multitasking activity,” respectively.

The results indicate that small modifications in a VR training application have a significant effect on learning outcome. In particular, a lower level of visual guidance can cause a higher level of mental workload during the training, forcing the user to actively deal with the learning content. Based on these findings, the opportunities and risks of current VR training simulations are discussed and recommendations to increase the learning effect are formulated.",

Measurement of workload should be included. However, subjective workload measurements could not provide detailed information and continuous monitoring of the changing workload. This study compared physiological (heart rate difference, heart rate variability, respiration rate and breathing wave amplitude) and activity (number of walking steps, peak acceleration, activity level, and inclination) measures with workload defined as intensity of task demand and estimated with a task complexity measure in an ISV test. The test was conducted on a full-scale simulator using a beyond design-basis accident scenario. The results show that heart rate difference and respiration rate are positively correlated with the estimated workload, while heart rate variability and breathing wave amplitude are negatively correlated with the estimated workload. For operations using traditional panels, high workload is accompanied by larger number of walking steps, higher activity level, and smaller angles of inclination. It is suggested that continuous monitoring of cardiovascular, respiration, and activity measures can detect workload change during the ISV test. Relevance to industry: This study provides recommendations for continuous monitoring of workload during an ISV test of a nuclear power plant. The identified physiological and activity measures can be applied in detecting workload change.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the input method and display mode of the situation map on EWA reconnaissance task performance with different information complexities. Eighteen participants attended a three-factor within-subject design experiment with input method (touch screen and mouse), display mode of the situation map (color and grayscale), and information complexity (high and low) as the independent variables. Participant behavior performance, subjective workload, heart rate/heart rate variability, and eye movements were recorded as the dependent variables. The results suggest that a touch screen requires greater task completion time and has greater physical demands than mouse operation; however, it also facilitates information processing by reducing the average fixation time. Color mode significantly decreases saccade counts compared to grayscale mode and is considered more appropriate for target search tasks as it induces less visual search load. High information complexity produces significant negative effects on behavior performance and subjective workload. It also has significant interaction effects with input method on fixation and saccade counts.

The system reliability is an indicator to evaluate the probability that an MSMN can provide sufficient capacity to meet a given demand. From the perspective of industrial and systems engineering, the MSMN is constructed as a network topology in which each node denotes an inspection point and arcs denote workstations. In particular, joint buffers with finite volume are embedded in such a topology. Based on the topology, workload processed by each workstation is derived according to a given demand. Subsequently, a simulation approach is applied to randomly generate the current capacity state for the MSMN and to compute the buffer usage under such a state. System reliability is estimated after several iterations of simulation to check if the generated capacity state is available to process the workload or not. Besides, sensitivity analysis is adopted to investigate the most potential location to increase buffer volume. Two practical examples are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed simulation approach. Experimental results show that using joint buffers is more reliable than using parallel buffers in separated production lines.",

The wider build customizability is a great advantage of this technology, but it adds complexity to the mix design. The compositions formed are far more complex than in conventional concrete, increasing the difficulty in designing mixtures for 3D concrete printing. As the number of materials in mix design increases, the workload increases exponentially during the development process. In this study, optimization methods are employed to automate the development of mortar mixes. The three objectives are the improvement of workability, buildability, and compressive strength. Eight factors are investigated in total, with three being qualitative and five quantitative. Those factors include cement, sand, and superplasticizer types as well as the water-to-binder ratio, the sand-to-binder ratio, and admixtures dosages. An initial D-optimal set of 18 mixtures is formed to drastically reduce the number of experiments. Feedforward neural networks are used to predict the properties of new mixtures. To increase the accuracy of the models, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of each network. Finally, the Pareto-optimization algorithm is used to control the materials and their dosages with the aim of simultaneously optimising the values of the three objectives. The proposed multiobjective approach generated mixtures with improved properties that met all three criteria after only five iterations and twenty-one additional mixtures were formed. The results indicate that this methodology can reduce the required workload while generating mixture compositions with improved properties by following an optimum trend.",5

In the present study, we investigated the neural dynamics underlying preserved behavioural performance after inducing cognitive fatigue (CF) in a sleep deprivation (SD) condition in which resources are naturally compromised. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we recorded cortical brain activity during task-related CF induction in the evening, in the middle of the night and early in the morning. Although cortical oxygenation similarly increased over the 3 sessions, decreased intra-hemispheric connectivity between left anterior frontal and frontal areas paralleled a sudden drop in task performance in the early morning. Our data indicate that decreased sustained attention after the induction of cognitive fatigue in a situation of high sleep pressure results from impaired connectivity between left prefrontal cortical areas rather than from a mere modulation in brain resources.",

This study evaluates the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions including engineering/technical and organizational interventions, and the involvement of the stakeholders in reducing musculoskeletal risk factors/symptoms. A pre-post-test experimental study in non-randomized groups was performed over three years in a sector of a truck assembly plant. The mean age of the operators in the sector for the initial and second assessment time was 42.0 (±7.6) years and 39.0 (±8.7), respectively. The mean length of work experience in the current job was 15.2 (±7.2) years and 13.9 (±7.3) for the initial and second assessment times, respectively. Five engineering ergonomic solutions and organizational interventions were implemented after a comprehensive ergonomic analysis. The organizational interventions consisted mostly of transferring and redistributing the tasks, i.e., ergonomically balancing and redesigning of the workstations. Before performing the interventions, the findings of the ergonomic study were presented at several meetings to encourage the involvement of the stakeholders (including managers, engineers, and operators) in the interventions. This study showed that a combination of ergonomic measures—engineering and organizational interventions—could reduce physical workloads. Musculoskeletal symptoms decreased after interventions although the difference was not significant.",

Most of the existing work focuses only on how to effectively schedule computing resources to execute computing requirements of simulation workflows in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Research on the scheduling of simulation workflows in consideration of task ordering, service selection, and resource allocation altogether has not been lacking. To fill in this void, this paper proposes a cloud-based 3-stage workflow scheduling model. Before scheduling computing resources to complete task requirements, the order of the tasks is determined and the services that can meet the task requirements are selected. In this model, the workload to satisfy task requirements is not fixed and takes on a different value depending upon the service selected with its unique complexity and accuracy. An optimization function that transforms and integrates makespan, cost, and accuracy in a unique way is proposed. For its solution, the relatively new symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm is modified and two SOS-based optimization strategies are developed, i.e., joint optimization-based SOS (JOSOS) and split optimization-based SOS (SOSOS). The simulation results reveal that SOS-based algorithms, especially the SOSOS method, outperform all compared algorithms. Based on the proposed method, simulation services and computing resources can be rationally selected and scheduled to ensure the requirements of IoT applications.",

This paper reinvestigates the modeling of the mental workload concept, by combining the model of Hart and Staveland (1988), which considers this concept as a multidimensional construction, and the models of Sperandio (1971) and Leplat (2006), which focus on the regulation of the activity by the operator. This combination reveals new relationships between the different dimensions of MWL, and especially points out a means of measuring and understanding the effect of regulation on the workload.

To address this, current study focuses on balancing a human-robot collaborative disassembly line. For the task operator allocation problem, a mapping constraint mechanism between the disassembly tasks and the task operators is established based on the remanufacture demand and hazard characteristics of components. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated, encompassing four optimization objectives: the number of workstations, the task operator idle balancing index, the demand index, and the hazard index. A novel modified teaching and learning optimization approach is proposed for the addressed human-robot collaborative disassembly line balancing problem. A two-layer encoding strategy is designed based on the solving characteristics of the problem and an embedded perturbation strategy based on randomly transforming the task operator is introduced to enhance the optimization performance of the proposed method. The validity of the mixed-integer programming model and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through two small-scale human-robot collaborative disassembly case studies. The proposed algorithm is then applied to two real-life cases of human-robot collaborative disassembly lines with different scales. The results of the proposed optimization method are compared with other advanced algorithms, demonstrating its superior performance in both single-objective and multi-objective optimization based on multiple evaluation indicators.",

In human neuroimaging, for example, avalanches occurring during resting-state show scale-invariant dynamics, supporting the hypothesis that the brain operates near a critical point that enables long range spatial communication. In fact, it has been suggested that such scale-invariant dynamics, characterized by a power-law distribution in these avalanches, are universal in neural systems and emerge through a common mechanism. While the analysis of avalanches and subsequent criticality is increasingly seen as a framework for using complex systems theory to understand brain function, it is unclear how the framework would account for the omnipresent cognitive variability, whether across individuals or tasks. To address this, we analyzed avalanches in the EEG activity of healthy humans during rest as well as two distinct task conditions that varied in cognitive demands and produced behavioral measures unique to each individual. In both rest and task conditions we observed that avalanche dynamics demonstrate scale-invariant characteristics, but differ in their specific features, demonstrating individual variability. Using a new metric we call normalized engagement, which estimates the likelihood for a brain region to produce high-amplitude bursts, we also investigated regional features of avalanche dynamics. Normalized engagement showed not only the expected individual and task dependent variability, but also scale-specificity that correlated with individual behavior. Our results suggest that the study of avalanches in human brain activity provides a tool to assess cognitive variability. Our findings expand our understanding of avalanche features and are supportive of the emerging theoretical idea that the dynamics of an active human brain operate close to a critical-like region and not a singular critical-state.",

First, for the set of 2D connected regions generated by slicing, we establish an optimized print sequence with a minimum idle stroke under interference constraints. Second, a continuous Zigzag path generation algorithm with controlled deposition direction is constructed for each 2D connected region, and path optimization is used to lessen the uneven deposition spacing. Finally, A separation axis theorem is used to prevent interference during the printing process, and we use a genetic algorithm to choose the connection points between 2D paths in a given spatial printing sequence to make the minimum idle stroke, creating a global continuous path with controllable deposition direction. The method proposed in this paper can provide the ability to customize the local deposition path direction and ensure the continuity of the global path to avoid interference and reduce the post-processing workload, so it is suitable for continuous path planning and multi-physics field optimization of complex structures, which can fully utilize the advantages of high-performance fibers to improve the customization ability and the performance of the fabricated parts for 3D printing and provide support for the manufacturing of high-performance structures in different fields.",

The present work differs from others in the literature by considering simple inventory control policies and using the simulation–optimization approach to calibrate their parameters. We consider two inventory control policies: (i) fixed cycling (First in Sequence - FIS) and (ii) dynamic scheduling based on inventory levels (Lowest Days of Supply - LDS), combined with an “order-up-to” lot sizing. The problem is solved using AnyLogic simulation software and the OptQuest search engine to minimize total inventory cost (ordering, holding and shortage costs). The experimental design included the following factors: number of items, coefficient of variation of demand, system workload, and degree of setup increment, allowing the comparison of the two inventory control policies in different scenarios. Experiments show that LDS outperforms FIS in all scenarios, achieving up to 4.6% cost savings for cases of more products, higher workload, and greater demand variance. The developed models proved to solve the problem, effectively generating reasonable solutions. Furthermore, as they are user-friendly, we believe they can be adapted, without great difficulties, to real-life scenarios of the process industry.",

The autonomous environmental camera control system we previously developed could provide operators with various visual information suited to the situation. To enable operators to adequately recognize environmental situations, multiple camera images are projected on multiple monitors, but this may increase the cognitive load of operators. The proposed situational understanding enhancer thus supports selective visual attention, situational awareness, and action decision, based on augmented visual prompts (AVPs). To support both work facilitation and danger avoidance, the AVPs include (i) monitor frame, (ii) obscuration, (iii) end-point vertical arrow, and (iv) distance arrow, with variable color and flashing effect. The system adaptively draws visual attention by changing the types and parameters of the AVPs according to the situations. Debris-removal tasks were conducted using a virtual reality simulator to compare the systems with and without AVP support. The results showed that the AVP support reduced the frequent changes in point of gaze, provided a sense of depth, and drew attention to potential collisions.",

It is observed that changes in parameter affects the visual feedback to the operator and also the complexity of the setups. Through user-studies using a human-in-the-loop simulator and questionnaires, we observe an increase in the perceived workload of the human operator for more complex setups.

In order to achieve scalability, thread pool system (TPS) has been used extensively as a middleware service in server applications. The size of thread pool is the most significant factor, that affects the overall performance of servers. Determining the optimal size of thread pool dynamically on runtime is a challenging problem. The most widely used and simple method to tackle this problem is to keep the size of thread pool equal to the request rate, i.e., the frequency-oriented thread pool (FOTP). The FOTPs are the most widely used TPSs in the industry, because of the implementation simplicity, the negligible overhead and the capability to use in any system. However, the frequency-based schemes only focused on one aspect of changes in the load, and that is the fluctuations in request rate. The request rate alone is an imperfect knob to scale thread pool. Thus, this paper presents a workload profiling based FOTP, that focuses on request size (service time of request) besides the request rate as a knob to scale thread pool on runtime, because we argue that the combination of both truly represents the load fluctuation in server-side applications. We evaluated the results of the proposed system against state of the art TPS of Oracle Corporation (by a client-server-based simulator) and concluded that our system outperformed in terms of both; the response times and throughput.",1

While many studies have focused on mental workload in relation to human performance, a modest body of work has examined it in a motor practice/learning context without considering individual variability. Thus, this work aimed to examine mental workload by employing the NASA TLX as well as the changes in motor performance resulting from the practice of a novel reaching task. Two groups of participants practiced a reaching task at a high and low nominal difficulty during which a group-level analysis assessed the mental workload, motor performance and motor improvement dynamics. A secondary cluster analysis was also conducted to identify specific individual patterns of cognitive-motor responses. Overall, both group- and cluster-level analyses revealed that: (i) all participants improved their performance throughout motor practice, and (ii) an increase in mental workload was associated with a reduction of the quality of motor performance along with a slower rate of motor improvement. The results are discussed in the context of the optimal challenge point framework and in particular it is proposed that under the experimental conditions employed here, functional task difficulty: (i) would possibly depend on an individuals’ information processing capabilities, and (ii) could be indexed by the level of mental workload which, when excessively heightened can decrease the quality of performance and more generally result in delayed motor improvements.",

Limiting the level of driver distraction caused by HMIs is an important concern. To explore the different positions and sizes of controls based on the multi-resource demands of the driver, a driving simulator experiment was conducted. The goal was to collect behavioral and subjective workload data from drivers performing secondary tasks under various conditions. Overall, the resources required by the driver to perform secondary tasks were relatively low on the left side of the HMI display and relatively high on the right side. Specifically, the lower-left position of the HMI display required the least resources, whereas the upper-right position required the most. Consequently, the results indicate that the resource demands of the secondary task on the driver decrease as the size of the controls increases. Most drivers preferred a “compromise” control size (18 mm). To reduce the resource demand, the control size of the HMI display should be set to at least 14 mm. This study has high industrial application value, and the results provide guidance for designing in-vehicle HMI displays with improved safety and usability.",

This parallel-group study, where each participant was exposed to one sound condition, had altogether 59 participants. Physiological stress was measured with stress hormone concentrations in plasma (cortisol and noradrenaline), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure. Psychological stress was measured with subjective noise annoyance, workload, and fatigue. Performance was measured in tasks requiring constant concentration (visual and auditory serial recall and N-back). Compared to quiet sound, impulsive sound caused more annoyance, workload, and lack of energy, raised cortisol concentrations, reduced systolic blood pressure, and decreased accuracy in the 3-back task. Compared with steady-state sound, impulsive sound was experienced as more annoying and causing a higher workload and more lack of energy. Impulsive sound caused physiological and psychological stress and decreased performance compared to quiet sound. Part of this load was due to the increased sound level, which was evident as a physiological stress reaction.

Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electrocardiography (ECG), the model's classifiers was above-chance to disentangle variations of mental workload from variations of acute stress. Both ECG and fNIRS could predict mental workload level, the best accuracy resulted from the two measures in combination. Stress level could not be accurately diagnosed through ECG alone, only with fNIRS or ECG and fNIRS combined. Individual calibration may be important since stress classification was more accurate for those with higher subjective state anxiety, perhaps due to a greater sensitivity to stress. Mental workload and stress were both better classified with activity in lateral prefrontal regions of the cortex than the medial areas, and the HbO2 signal generally lead to better classification than HHB. The current model represents a step forward to finely discriminate different mental states despite their rather analog physiological correlates.",

However, most previous research on wearable AR technology did not effectively supported situation-aware task assistance because of AR marker-based static visualization and registration. In this study, a smart and user-centric task assistance method is proposed, which combines deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to provide more effective visual guidance with less cognitive load. In particular, instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN and markerless AR are combined to overlay the 3D spatial mapping of an actual object onto its surrounding real environment. In addition, 3D spatial information with instance segmentation is used to provide 3D task guidance and navigation, which helps the user to more easily identify and understand physical objects while moving around in the physical environment. Furthermore, 2.5D or 3D replicas support the 3D annotation and collaboration between different workers without predefined 3D models. Therefore, the user can perform more realistic manufacturing tasks in dynamic environments. To verify the usability and usefulness of the proposed method, we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses by conducting two user studies: 1) matching a virtual object to a real object in a real environment, and 2) performing a realistic task, that is, the maintenance and inspection of a 3D printer. We also implemented several viable applications supporting task assistance using the proposed deep learning-based task assistance in wearable AR.",

Automating energy optimization tasks eases the workload on engineers and hastens energy savings. More than 85% of building data is unstructured and diverse, concealing energy insights that demand laborious extraction.

The framework includes three stages: building information processing, performance diagnosis, and retrofit recommendation, where LLMs injected with domain expertise act as agents for the roles of planner, researcher and advisor. We develop knowledge databases with retriever tools to inject knowledge and validate through experiments. In case studies, our framework delivered reliable results with only $5.15, effectively handling diverse inputs and tasks across cases. This demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce repetitive human labor and costs. We also discuss the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as trustworthy, generalized automated task solvers.",

However, the interpretation of these ratings is debated. In this study, empirical evidence for the measures' theoretical assumptions was investigated by comparing operators' ratings collected immediately after performing a scenario and ratings collected after operators' acquisition through a video review of the scenario, knowledge of actual system states. Eighteen licensed control room operators participated in the simulator study, running 12 relatively challenging scenarios. It was found that the interpretation of TLX items involving introspection remained stable after operators acquired factual scenario knowledge, while the interpretation of items involving the perception of external events, such as situation awareness and performance, depended on the operators' scenario knowledge. The result shows that operators’ ratings could discriminate between mental effort, performance, frustration, and situation awareness. No clear evidence for the SART index as a measure of situation awareness was found. Instead, a subjective situation awareness measure developed for this study was distinct from workload and related to operator performance, showing that this type of measure warrants future investigation of its validity. The study findings help in developing measurement procedures and interpreting subjective measures. Finally, the study reveals that informing operators about the scenario can provide useful subjective ratings of situation awareness and performance. Future research should include procedures for how to inform participants adequately and efficiently in subjective assessments.",

The quantification of these impacts requires the evaluation of both the manufacturing and use phase energy/environmental costs of major integrated circuit (IC) components, including processing units, memory, and storage. In particular, expansions of memory and cache can potentially increase manufacturing costs beyond what can be recovered through use phase advantages for reasonable usage patterns. With this holistic view of sustainability in mind, we provide evaluations of the environmental impacts of memory and cache options for Parsec and SPEC multi-program workloads. Using indifference point analysis, we determine which architectural decisions are the most sustainable in the context of these workloads for various usage scenarios. Through a form of break even analysis, we show the impact of upgrading to a new technology node. Our analysis of current processor trends indicates that upgrading may require upwards of 10 years of service time to break even, and that designing systems with smaller cache and main memory sizes may provide an overall positive environmental trend without dramatically reducing performance.",

Such an infrastructure must be reproducible so that several studies are able to compare themselves but also capable of diversity as otherwise it would risk to limit them to particular subcases. In this article, we propose a generic adaptable and reusable model of large scale workload. The original schema comes from the Google Cluster Workload Traces which is a perfect representative of large scale production workload. The methodology to produce the model can be used at different precision levels and can classify the input level without human supervision. Contrary to most model analysis of such traces, we propose along with our model a reference implementation in order for other studies using our results to produce comparable experiments.",

Identifying an optimal balance between total energy consumption and makespan presents a challenge due to the intricate nature of their relationship in real-world scenarios. This study introduces a mixed-integer programming model designed to determine optimal machine operating states for diverse workloads, meeting customer requirements while concurrently achieving energy savings for sustainability. An energy-aware batch scheduling deep Q-learning network (EBSDQN) framework has been created, encompassing sequencing policies, batching rules, and speed adjustment policies. This framework is explicitly crafted to tackle the NP-hard problem, a challenge that commonly perplexes commercial solvers like Gurobi when seeking optimal solutions within a 360-second time frame for small-scale instances. The EBSDQN design is fortified with efficient action decoding policies, refined reward assessments, exploitative neighborhood rules, and a streamlined buffer training process. This approach not only conserves training time but also adapts dynamically in accordance with the principles of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and deep neural network. The developed algorithm exhibits impressive robustness, reaching convergence after 600 episodes of training. In separate comparisons with a commercial solver, two single-objective algorithms, and two multi-objective algorithms, our algorithm consistently demonstrates superior overall performance across the same instances. In the worst-case analysis, further examination delves into the influences of job features. In summary, this study underscores the high sensitivity of both TEC and Cmax to job processing time distribution, suggesting the prioritization of TEC over Cmax in optimization for sustainable planning and operations. Furthermore, this research has the potential to accelerate the integration of artificial intelligence into the manufacturing sector.",

Several approaches exist that aim to better understand the causes for workload, and models have been derived to predict workload in new operational settings. These methods often relate workload to the diffculty, or complexity, that an average controller would have to safely manage all traffc in a sector with a particular traffc demand. In this paper, several of these complexity-based metrics for workload will be compared. Of special interest is whether the complexity measures transfer from one sector design to another. That is, does a metric that is well-tuned to predict workload for controllers working in one sector, also predict the workload for another group of controllers active in a different sector? Results from a human-in-the-loop experiment show that a solution space-based metric, which requires no tuning or weighing at all, has the highest correlations with subjectively reported workload, and also yields the best workload predictions across different controller groups and sectors.",19

A novel multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is formulated with the following objectives: minimizing the number of workers, the number of workstations, workload imbalance, maximizing worker satisfaction, and worker performance. Moreover, this study is proposing heuristics to utilize game theory-oriented approaches in the context of the addressed problem. Some comparative studies were carried out to compare the performance of the proposed heuristics. The effects of the factors were revealed by the statistical analysis conducted on the solutions for newly generated test problems. After the superiority of the proposed heuristics was indicated through comparative studies, they were applied to a washing machine disassembly system in the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) industry.

Developed and implemented from a predictive analytics perspective in the particular context of a Portuguese aircraft maintenance organization, the tool integrates four main modules: (1) a forecasting module used to predict future and unprecedented maintenance workloads from historical data; (2) a Bayesian inference module used to transform prior workload forecasts, resulting from the forecasting module, into predictive forecasts after observations on the maintenance interventions being predicted become available; (3) a simulation module used to characterize the forecasted total workloads through sets of random variables, including maintenance work types, maintenance work phases, and maintenance work skills; and (4) a Bayesian network module used to combine the simulated workloads with historical data through probabilistic inference. A linear programming model is also developed to improve the efficiency of the decision-making process supported by Bayesian networks. The tool uses real industrial data, comprising 171 aircraft maintenance projects collected at the host organization, and is validated by comparing its results with real observations of a given maintenance intervention to which predictions were made and with a model simulating current forecasting practices employed in industry. Significantly more accurate forecasts have been obtained with the proposed tool, resulting in an important cost saving potential for maintenance organizations.",

Existing systems, however, can be criticized for their limited applicability and scope. First, card-based systems have not been successful in the production environments that are arguably most in need of their help: complex job shops that produce low-volume, high-variety products. Second, while most existing systems simplify shop floor control, other planning tasks – such as the estimation of short, feasible due dates during customer enquiry management – are not supported. To overcome these limitations, a card-based version of Workload Control – known as COBACABANA (COntrol of BAlance by CArd-BAsed Navigation) – was recently proposed that uses cards for both due date estimation and order release control. This unique combination makes COBACABANA a potentially important means of controlling production, particularly for small job shops with limited resources. However, the original approach had several shortcomings. This paper refines the due date estimation procedure of COBACABANA to make it more practical and consistent with the order release method applied. It then uses simulation to demonstrate – for the first time – the potential of COBACABANA as an integrated concept that combines customer enquiry management and order release control to improve job shop performance. Results also suggest that the need for processing time estimations can be simplified, further facilitating the implementation of COBACABANA in practice.",

A crucial challenge for HHC providers is to optimize routes and schedules for their caregivers to serve customers. Inspired by the practices in the HHC industry, this paper addresses a multi-objective home healthcare routing and scheduling problem (HHRSP) with several conflicting objectives: minimizing routing cost and improving service consistency and workload balance. We refer to the problem as a multi-objective consistent home healthcare routing and scheduling problem (MoConHHRSP). To be more practical, uncertain travel and service times are also considered and defined based on uncertainty theory. Next, the uncertain programming model for the proposed MoConHHRSP is formulated and then reduced to its deterministic equivalent. Due to the NP-hard essence of the problem, an improved multi-objective artificial bee colony (IMOABC) metaheuristic, integrating the large neighborhood search heuristic and an adapted non-dominated solution set update strategy into the multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) framework, is developed. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the competitive performance of the designed algorithm by comparing it with other multi-objective algorithms from multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the trade-off analysis reveals that a better caregiver consistency can be achieved at a high price of total costs and workload balance, while a great improvement on the workload balance can be provided with little deterioration in caregiver consistency. In many cases, low total costs and a high level of workload balance can be achieved simultaneously.",

A multi-objective function is used to minimize makespan, resource’s idle time, and job’s lateness. Alternative encoding schemes and deadlock prevention mechanisms are also investigated. The results show that the initial heuristic purely based on the earliest finish concept performs as well as more information intensive heuristics; another heuristic based on the localization approach also shows good performance.

One of the issues is the Transient Stability Assessment, due to multiple hindrances, the power system aims to maintain its synchronism. In the power system, ensuring reliability in planning, control, and monitoring is essential. With the development of new techniques like electric components, power electronics, renewable power generations, etc., to ensure safety and reliability, and improve economic conditions, human interference is complicated. Therefore, a computer-based assessment is needed. Transient stability assessment (TSA) ensures security and provides stable operation in the power system. This paper proposed support-vector machines(SVM)-based support-vector machines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to assist the operation of the power system (SVM-CNN). The novelty of the proposed work is, it minimizes the workload of operational staff and improves efficiency and ability using SVM-based CNN. With the proposed accuracy rate for the training data set was 97.02 %, and the testing data set was 96.83 %. SVM got 96.44 %, and CNN got 96.68 % in the training data set. and the testing data set produces 95.24 % in SVM and 95.74 % in the CNN model.",

However, the human element adds great risk to systems and cannot be ignored. This research explores the human elements related to security communications and intention to comply with security directives. Security communications are more-commonly being sent using richer computer-based channels. While the goal of security communications is the gain compliance, there is still much to learn related to what influences a user to comply. This research explores the effects that (im)politeness has on intention to comply with security directives. The research utilized an experiment that focused on secure browser setting directives using several types of online communication. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive communications/directives that were text-based, text/image-based, or video-based. The communications were also grouped into polite and impolite messaging. The results for the overall model indicated perceived richness had a negative influence on perceived mental workload. Additionally, perceived mental workload resulted in a decreased intention to comply with security directives. There were no significant differences between polite and impolite groups for the treatment groups with text-based and text/image-based messaging. However, in the video-based treatment, the relationship between perceived richness and intention to comply with security directives was significantly different between the polite and impolite groups.",

However, three challenges impede accurate separation errors forecasting: 1) compounding relationships between many human factors and control processes require sufficient operation process data to capture how separation errors occur and propagate within controller-in-the-loop processes; 2) previous human factor measurement approaches are disruptive to controllers’ daily operations because they use invasive sensors, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), 3) errors accumulated in using the tasks and human behaviors for estimating system dynamics challenge accurate separation error predictions with sufficient leading time for proactive control actions. This study proposed a separation error prediction framework with a long leading time (>50 s) to address the above challenges, including 1) a multi-factorial model that characterizes the inter-relationships between task complexity, behavioral activity, cognitive load, and operational performance; 2) a multimodal data analytics approach to non-intrusively extract the task features (i.e., traffic density) from high-fidelity simulation systems and visual behavioral features (i.e., head pose, eyelid movements, and facial expressions) from ATCOs’ facial videos; 3) an encoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict long-time-ahead separation errors by integrating multimodal features for reducing accumulated errors. A user study with six experienced ATCOs tested the proposed framework using the Phoenix Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) simulator. The authors evaluated the model performance through two types of metrics: 1) point-level metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, and 2) sequence-level metrics, including alignment accuracy and sequence similarity. The results showed that 1) the model using the task and visual behavioral features significantly improved the prediction performance compared to the model using one single feature (eyelid movements), with an improvement of up to 26.95% in alignment accuracy for 10s-ahead prediction; 2) the model that combined task and visual behavioral features had a higher or comparable performance to models with different hybrid features, achieving an alignment accuracy of 82.38% for 50s-ahead error prediction; and (3) the proposed method outperformed three baseline models – Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and classic LSTM – by 8.21%, 3.47%, and 3.14% in alignment accuracy, respectively, for predicting 50s-ahead separation errors. These results suggest that the proposed model can effectively predict separation errors in air traffic control.",

In Industry 4.0, this task is critical when the costs associated with maintenance and stoppages on the productive processes are high. Nowadays, many preventive maintenance techniques employ supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms. However, the definition of which features should be processed by such algorithms is not a simple task, being crucial to the proposed technique’s success. Against this background, we consider whether unsupervised algorithms combined with time-series decomposition can enhance the estimate of a machine’s health. This article proposes HealthMon as a novel approach to compute a health index of machines based on sensor measurements. HealthMon extracts time-series from such sensors, which are decomposed in an unsupervised way to present the health state along time. The health index is related to the degradation of the considered machine, thus optimizing the machine maintenance schedule. This work advances the state-of-the-art in the following ways: (i) it proposes a novel index of machines health, which yields a more direct and intuitive view of machine degradation; (ii) it devises the first approach capable of estimating the health index of a machine in a completely unsupervised way; (iii) it generalizes vibrating and rotating machines, thus being able to monitor a wide range of industrial equipment. We evaluated our method using both simulated and real data. The results show that the evolution of vibrating machines’ failures can be effectively detected under various input workloads. Finally, through HealthMon, industry decision-makers benefit from the guidelines for preventive actions at appropriate times, thus meeting Industry 4.0.",

It is a visual control system that manages the flow of jobs though the shop floor by making use of overlapping loops of cards between pairs of successive manufacturing cells. These overlapping loops of cards realize a decentralized decision-making structure for job release. This means that jobs do not await release in a centralized pre-shop pool. Rather jobs are immediately forwarded to a gateway manufacturing cells at their shop arrival, where they wait in release lists for available POLCA cards. However, the Workload Control literature has shown that using a centralized pre-shop pool provides important benefits. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of centralized job release on POLCA performance. Using simulation, we demonstrate that centralized job release outperforms decentralised release if the right card acquisition rule for job release is used. This has important implications for both research and practice calling for more research on POLCA systems.",13

Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is a multisession transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy protocol that can treat a range of common co-morbid mental and behavioral mental health problems, including UAU. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we previously reported that CETA was clinically effective in reducing UAU and mental health comorbidities among PWH in Zambia. In this qualitative evaluation we sought to explore health worker, key policymaker and patient perspectives on the acceptability and feasibility of integrating CETA within existing HIV services. Methodology We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with PWH who reported alcohol use, lay and profession HIV clinic staff, and key informant interviews with policy-makers. Following trial completion, we conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) among people with HIV and UAU who received CETA, and HIV peer counsellors that provided CETA. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed in NVivo 12 using thematic analysis. Emerging themes were organized according to acceptability and feasibility. Results All participant types reported CETA to be acceptable due to the perceived need and relevance to HIV-related behavioral health issues. HIV peer counselors, successfully provided CETA with a rigorous supervision structure using an apprenticeship model. Participants receiving CETA also remained motivated throughout the sessions as they learned new problem-solving skills, which they continued to use following the close of the study. Implementation factors related to limited behavioral health infrastructure, workloads, and human resources were seen as challenges to the scale-up and sustainability of CETA within HIV care. Conclusion CETA was feasible and acceptable at 2 urban sites in Zambia. Future studies integrating of CETA into HIV care should consider implementation factors such as infrastructure, workloads, and human resources to support integration into HIV care.",

Manual effort required for the evaluation of these assessments is very high. Automation of the evaluation process and grading helps in making the review process more efficient, objective, and scalable, thereby reducing the workload of human reviewers. Automating the grading process for multiple-choice and short-answer assessments is relatively straightforward, but it poses significant challenges when applied to the evaluation of formal languages, particularly in the context of mathematical assessments. In this paper a model that automatically evaluates and grades the Quadratic Equation problems is presented. The study is conducted using a manually curated dataset comprising 1200 solutions to various quadratic equation problems. Embeddings of the quadratic solutions are generated using Google’s T5 Model. These embeddings are then used to train different traditional and ensembled machine learning models along with complex Deep learning models like LSTM and Bi LSTM. An in-depth analysis of the fine-tuned T5 model’s performance, evaluating its effectiveness in comparison with the pretrained T5 model in automatic grading of quadratic equation problems has been explored. Fine-tuning significantly contributes to the reduction of error by 70% and a noticeable increase in the R2 value to 97%.",

In the case of railroad networks, hierarchical organizations denoted as traffic control centers (TCCs) operate 24/7 in order to maintain successful network operations. Interacting social and technical factors influence TCC operational environments and thus the overall performance of the railroad system. This research presents a novel data envelopment analysis (DEA) application along with its implementation and validation by investigating the workload boundary of human performance through a case study built for the Belgian railway (INFRABEL) TCCs. We pursue two research foci. The first is to identify organizational, socio-economic, and technical factors that describe the performance environments in which TCC personnel operate. We use these factors to determine relatively homogeneous performance environments using multivariate statistical methods. The second focus is to design and implement on-site a socio-technical performance measurement framework, based on a new and unique dataset at the workstation level that is capable of considering socio-technical heterogeneity. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we apply a two-stage clustering approach to generate statistically relatively homogeneous groups. Second, we calculate meta - and in-cluster efficiency scores. Finally, we assess the validity of our results with INFRABEL. Results reveal three insights: (i) efficiency improvement strategies require further investigation based on temporal trends; (ii) disregarding performance environment heterogeneity leads to over estimation in target setting; and (iii) socio-technical system design could be informed by applying DEA, provided that, domain specific expertise is used in the model formulation.",1

However, non-contact sensors must collect reliable and accurate signals. This study aims to compare the in-seat, non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor to the gold standard, contact Biopac sensor. Thirty participants took part in five-minute simulated autonomous vehicle journeys in a city environment and a rural environment, and a five-minute resting condition. To ensure the seat sensor was sensitive to elevated heart rate values, heart rate was also collected following the energetic Harvard Step Test. Lin concordance coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses were employed to assess the level of agreement between the non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor and the contact Biopac sensor for heart rate and heart rate variability. Analyses revealed a high level of agreement (rc > 0.96) between both sensors for one-minute averaged heart rate and five-minute averaged heart rate variability during simulated autonomous driving and rest, and one-minute averaged heart rate following the Harvard Step Test. In addition, the non-contact sensor was sensitive to significant differences during tasks. This proof of principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using the non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor to accurately detect heart rate and heart rate variability during simulated autonomous driving environments.",

To improve staffing efficiency and service quality, we propose a double-resource queueing model (DRQM) with referral and a single-resource queueing model (SRQM) with inner classification. We solve the problems of police staffing and workload assignment by optimizing the referral threshold in the DRQM and the inner classification criterion in the SRQM. Results show that the SRQM with inner classification can always achieve higher staffing efficiency than the DRQM with referral. On service quality, dependent on the optimal referral threshold in DRQM or the optimal inner classification criterion in SRQM, either DRQM or SRQM is preferred.",2

Specifically, we present a bi-objective threshold optimization model to achieve a trade-off between human costs and scoring fairness in HMCSSA problems. Moreover, four well-known MOEAs are employed for solving the optimization model to search the Pareto optimal thresholds. Meanwhile, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is utilized to determine the best human–machine task allocation schemes based on the preferences of decision makers.

A situation awareness support system (SASS) has therefore been developed to handle uncertain situations [1]. This paper aims to systematically evaluate the enhancement of SA in SASS by applying a multi-perspective approach. The approach consists of two SA metrics, SAGAT and SART, and one workload metric, NASA-TLX. The first two metrics are used for the direct objective and subjective measurement of SA, while the third is used to estimate operator workload. The approach is applied in a safety-critical environment called residue treater, located at a chemical plant in which a poor human-system interface reduced the operator׳s SA and caused one of the worst accidents in US history. A counterbalanced within-subjects experiment is performed using a virtual environment interface with and without the support of SASS. The results indicate that SASS improves operators׳ SA, and specifically has benefits for SA levels 2 and 3. In addition, it is concluded that SASS reduces operator workload, although further investigations in different environments with a larger number of participants have been suggested.",

In particular, why do humans make near-rational inferences in some natural domains where the candidate hypotheses are explicitly available, whereas tasks in similar domains requiring the self-generation of hypotheses produce systematic deviations from rational inference. We propose that these deviations arise from algorithmic processes approximating Bayes’ rule. Specifically in our account, hypotheses are generated stochastically from a sampling process, such that the sampled hypotheses form a Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior. While this approximation will converge to the true posterior in the limit of infinite samples, we take a small number of samples as we expect that the number of samples humans take is limited. We show that this model recreates several well-documented experimental findings such as anchoring and adjustment, subadditivity, superadditivity, the crowd within as well as the self-generation effect, the weak evidence, and the dud alternative effects.

We also partially confirm our model’s prediction about the effect of time pressure and cognitive load on these effects.",

The support structures are needed for an overhang, or severe overhang distortion may be caused by repeated rapid heating and cooling cycles in the layer-by-layer manufacturing process. Current overhang support generation methods usually utilize certain types of structures to fill the overhang space. They may overestimate the amount of support, thus, the post process time can be potentially increased. The objective of this study is to investigate an effective support design method to reduce support material usage and post process workload in EBAM process. In this research, a combined heat support and support anchor design method has been proposed. The stress and deformation of overhang configuration has been evaluated by a thermomechanical model. The design procedure has been introduced in details for a typical overhang example. The simulations have demonstrated that overhang warping can be effectively reduced by the application of a heat support beneath overhang region and support anchors which connect overhang and heat support.",

Human errors affect the machine that the person operates in a MMU and contribute to dependent competing failure processes (DCFPs) of unit (DCFPsU): soft and hard failure processes. Random shocks affect all MMUs and contribute to DCFPs of system (DCFPsS): unit soft/hard failure one after another until the system failure and common cause failures. In addition, once a MMU fails, more workloads are shared on surviving MMUs due to load-sharing characteristic, which increase not only machine degradation rates but also human error intensities. We incorporate human errors into reliability analysis besides degradation processes and random shocks and develop an analytical reliability model of load-sharing man-machine system. A Poisson-type human error model considering the effects of workload is proposed first. To model the DCFPsU, DCFPsS, and load-sharing characteristic, conditional distributions of DCFPsU and conditional probability density functions of MMU failures are investigated. A system reliability model is then developed based on total probability formula through analytical derivation. Finally, a load-sharing 2-out-of-3:G lathe system and small-, medium- and large-scale examples are implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the reliability model.",

Thus, it is of great significance to improve the wear resistance of low-alloy abrasion-resistant steels without increasing their hardness. A series of TiC-reinforced low-alloy abrasion-resistant steels with different hardness was developed by a conventional smelting-casting method. The microstructure of the TiC-reinforced steels was martensite, and micro- and nano-sized TiC particles were distributed in the martensite matrix. The three-body abrasive wear behaviors of a series of TiC-reinforced steels and conventional steels under dry and wet sand conditions were studied using dry and wet sand/rubber wheel testing machines, respectively. Under dry sand conditions, the main wear mechanism of TiC-reinforced steels was plastic deformation and fatigue spalling, and the wear resistance of the TiC-reinforced steels was more than 1.5 times that of conventional steels with the same hardness. Under wet sand conditions, the wear mechanism of TiC-reinforced steels was slight micro-cutting and peeling, the relative wear resistance of the TiC-reinforced steels was more than 1.4 times that of conventional steels.",

Each berthing could also be divided into five phases, three during the execution and two resting periods, one before and one after the execution (dedicated to baseline physiological data collection). Mental workload was measured through two self assessment scales: the NASA TLX and a Likert scale. Power spectral densities on Beta bands 1 and 2 were obtained from EEG.

However, the traditional design of ventilation and cooling for high geothermal tunnel construction only considers the control of environment temperature and ignores the thermal comfort state of the workers, which will increase the potential risk of tunnel safety accidents. Therefore, this paper adopted the methods of scene testing, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation to establish a modified evaluation model applicable to the thermal comfort of workers in high geothermal tunnels. By analyzing the temperature distribution pattern of heat-sensitive parts of workers engaged in different labor intensity under different air supply parameters, the design strategy for ventilation and cooling of high-temperature tunnels was refined on the basis of ensuring that the environment temperature and thermal comfort meet the requirements. The results show that ventilation design parameters that satisfy the environmental temperature control criteria are equally adequate for worker thermal comfort at light-intensity work. However, when the ambient temperature is higher than 40 °C, the thermal comfort of workers engaged in medium-intensity work still does not meet the requirements, even if the ambient temperature already meets the criteria. It is recommended that the wind speed be increased by at least 8.3 %, 15.6%and 28.6 % for ambient temperatures of 40 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C, respectively. More effective cooling techniques should be tried to further enhance thermal comfort for workers engaged in heavy workloads especially in hot environments exceeding 40 °C.",

In the past few decades, crack detection was highly depended on human-conducted on-site inspections. It was not transformed to automatic crack defection until a spot light on deep learning. Although automatic detection based on deep learning is of advantage in both of efficiency and accuracy, the heavy workload of manual annotation is the first challenge we face. Collecting rich and well-balanced crack defect datasets is the second one. To rise to the challenges, this paper proposes two improved CycleGANs, named Tiny Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network (Tiny-CycleGAN) and Multi Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network (Multi-CycleGAN). Additionally, inside of the neural networks we propose, we introduce spectral normalization into the discriminators of them to boost synthesis quality and stabilize training. Experimental results demonstrate that these approaches not only translate from bridge crack images to their paired high-quality label images, but also augment crack images from unpaired label images effectively. Lastly, a deep learning based semantic segmentation network, U-Net with attention gate (AttU-Net), is trained on the augmented dataset to evaluate the performance of improved CycleGANs. The evaluations of semantic segmentation show that dataset of augmentation with Multi-CycleGAN outperforms dataset without augmentation by up to 0.5417 on mIoU and 97.45% on mPA, respectively.",

The TDAE consists of three consecutively-connected modules, which are termed as feature filter, abstraction filter, and transferred MW classifier. The feature and abstraction filters introduce dynamical deep network to abstract the EEG features across adjacent time steps to salient MW indicators. Transferred MW classifier exploits large volume EEG data from an source-domain EEG database recorded under emotional stimuli to improve the model training stability.

Because of the increasing complexity of customer personalization, the cognitive information from both sides becomes uncertain and fuzzy. Linguistics is used to describe uncertain preferences, especially in platforms. Also, the cloud model is adopted to convert the linguistics to reflect the randomness and fuzziness. Meanwhile, as the rapid development of communication techniques has strengthened the connections between different agents, the final matching results are affected by connections. Hence, the peer effect, which describes the mutual influences among individuals, is introduced in our study. In addition, considering the different strengths of the connections, the peer effect is improved by integrating grey relations, which are used to evaluate the diverse connections. Finally, the workload is introduced in the form of adjustment parameters. Consequently, we establish a bi-objective model that aims to maximize satisfaction and minimize the differences among individuals.

The optimization of the simulator numerical parameters plays a vital role as it could save considerable computational efforts. State-of-the-art optimization techniques are based on running numerous simulations, specific for that purpose, to find good parameter candidates. However, using such an approach is highly costly in terms of time and computing resources. This work presents TunaOil, a new methodology to enhance the search for optimal numerical parameters of reservoir flow simulations using a performance model. In the O&G industry, it is common to use ensembles of models in different workflows to reduce the uncertainty associated with forecasting O&G production. We leverage the runs of those ensembles in such workflows to extract information from each simulation and optimize the numerical parameters in their subsequent runs. To validate the methodology, we implemented it in a history matching (HM) process that uses a Kalman filter algorithm to adjust an ensemble of reservoir models to match the observed data from the real field. We mine past execution logs from many simulations with different numerical configurations and build a machine learning model based on extracted features from the data. These features include properties of the reservoir models themselves, such as the number of active cells, to statistics of the simulation’s behavior, such as the number of iterations of the linear solver. A sampling technique is used to query the oracle to find the numerical parameters that can reduce the elapsed time without significantly impacting the quality of the results. Our experiments show that the predictions can improve the overall HM workflow runtime on average by 31%.",

Fortunately, there have been no significant attacks on civil aircraft to date, which allows the handling of these emerging threats to be approached proactively. Although an ample body of research into technical defense strategies exists, current research neglects to take the human operator into account. In this study, we present an exploratory experiment focusing on pilots confronted with a cyber-attack. Results show that the occurrence of an attack affects all dependent variables: pilots' workload, trust, eye-movements, and behavior. Pilots experiencing an attack report heavier workload and weakened trust in the system than pilots whose aircraft is not under attack. Further, pilots who experienced an attack monitored basic flying instruments less and their performance deteriorated. A warning about a potential attack seems to moderate several of those effects. Our analysis prompts us to recommend incorporating cyber-awareness into pilots' recurrent training; we also argue that one has to consider all affected personnel when designing such training. Future research should target the development of appropriate procedures and training techniques to prepare pilots to correctly identify and respond to cyber-attacks.",

It is known that various neuroimaging technologies can be used to identify the MWL variations. In order to classify MWL into a few discrete levels using representative MWL indicators and small-sized training samples, a novel EEG-based approach by combining locally linear embedding (LLE), support vector clustering (SVC) and support vector data description (SVDD) techniques is proposed and evaluated by using the experimentally measured data. The MWL indicators from different cortical regions are first elicited by using the LLE technique. Then, the SVC approach is used to find the clusters of these MWL indicators and thereby to detect MWL variations. It is shown that the clusters can be interpreted as the binary class MWL. Furthermore, a trained binary SVDD classifier is shown to be capable of detecting slight variations of those indicators. By combining the two schemes, a SVC–SVDD framework is proposed, where the clear-cut (smaller) cluster is detected by SVC first and then a subsequent SVDD model is utilized to divide the overlapped (larger) cluster into two classes. Finally, three-class MWL levels (low, normal and high) can be identified automatically. The experimental data analysis results are compared with those of several existing methods. It has been demonstrated that the proposed framework can lead to acceptable computational accuracy and has the advantages of both unsupervised and supervised training strategies.",3

Therefore, SPADs provide a practical and applied safety relevant context within which to structure a discussion on fatigue. Focus groups discussing contributing factors to SPADs were undertaken at eight passenger rail organisations across Australia and New Zealand (n = 28 drivers). Data relating to fatigue was extracted and inductively analysed identifying three themes: causes, consequences, and countermeasures (to fatigue). Drivers experienced negative consequences of fatigue, despite existing countermeasures to mitigate it. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue management. A fatigue assessment tool consistently informed rostering, however, shift swapping was commonplace and often unregulated, reducing any potential positive impact. In discussing fatigue countermeasure strategies, drivers talked interchangeably about mitigating task related fatigue (e.g. increasing cognitive load) and sleepiness (e.g. caffeine).

Especially for the area of unmanned aviation, driven by the rise in drones, having human controllers might become unfeasible. One of the methods that is currently being investigated for replacing the conflict resolution task of Air Traffic Control is Reinforcement Learning. As violation of the required separation margins, also called an intrusion, is an event of relatively low frequency, using Reinforcement Learning for this task comes with difficulties that can potentially be attributed to data imbalance. This paper artificially increased the traffic density during the training phase of the Reinforcement Learning method to investigate what the importance is of a balanced data set on the performance of the Reinforcement Learning method. It was found that as the traffic density increased, the Reinforcement Learning methods started to outperform the analytical methods. Beyond this it was found that methods trained at higher traffic densities, but tested at lower traffic densities, outperformed the methods trained at that specific density.

Human-Centered Design (HCD) and Human Factors (HF) principles are recommended to improve the usability of health IT and reduce its negative impact on patients and clinicians; however, challenges persist. The objective of this study is to understand how an HCD process influences the usability of health IT. We conducted a systematic retrospective analysis of the HCD process used in the design of a CDS for pulmonary embolism diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). Guided by the usability outcomes (e.g., barriers and facilitators) of the CDS use “in the wild” (see Part 1 of this research in the accompanying manuscript), we performed deductive content analysis of 17 documents (e.g., design session transcripts) produced during the HCD process. We describe if and how the design team considered the barriers and facilitators during the HCD process. We identified 7 design outcomes of the HCD process, for instance designing a workaround and making a design change to the CDS. We identify gaps in the current HCD process and demonstrate the need for a continuous health IT design process.",

These components act as secondary, and independent structural systems, that allow civil construction to autonomously reconfigure their internal structure to adapt to severe loading conditions in real-time. As a result, an autonomous infrastructure can achieve higher levels of structural resilience under extreme events (i.e. fire, earthquake etc.). This improved performance mitigates premature failure (collapse), thus providing occupants with sufficient time to evacuate, and allowing first responders to tackle the adverse effects of disasters. The practicality of the proposed concepts is illustrated through a comprehensive case study that covers fundamental aspects of structural performance and human evacuation in a super-tall 80-storey high-rise building undergoing an extreme event.",

Although attempts have been made to alleviate the problem by providing external assistance to operators and laborers, being struck by objects and equipment remains the third leading cause of construction fatalities (behind falls and transportation incidents) for the past decade. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of how operators respond to the external assistance has great potential to improve operation safety from a human-centered perspective.

To evaluate the role of limb movement frequency in determining the fast exercise drive to breathe, endurance runners and recreationally-active controls performed two sinusoidal exercise protocols on a cycle ergometer. One protocol was performed at constant workload with sinusoidal pedaling cadence, and a second with sinusoidal workload at constant cadence. Metabolic rate (VO2) increases and means were matched between these two experiments. The ventilatory response was significantly faster when limb movement speed was varied, compared to when pedal loading was varied (18.49±15.6s vs. 50.5±14.5s, p<0.05). Ventilation response amplitudes were significantly higher during pedal cadence variation versus pedal loading variation (3.99±0.25 vs. 2.58±0.17L/min, p<0.05). Similar findings were obtained for endurance athletes, with significantly attenuated ventilation responses to exercise versus control subjects. We conclude that fast changes in limb movement frequency are a potent stimulus for ventilation at submaximal workloads, and that this response is susceptible to attenuation through training.",

In particular, the computer-mediated interaction affects customers' perceived accessibility into self-services. Thus, we posed the following research question: “How does an individual's ability to use a computer influence the need for direct person-to-person interaction in services?” The study is based on a postal survey conducted in south-eastern Finland. Data were collected using a random sample of N = 3000 people ranging from 60 to 90 years of age. A total of 1121 valid responses were received. The data were slightly biased towards respondents who are coping well. We employed structural equation modelling with a multi-group moderation approach in the analysis. The findings indicate that satisfaction is related to routines in the service process. Customers' ability to perform the requisite role in the service process influences their preference for human interaction. Interestingly, the value of human interaction is driven by customers' expected abilities, whereas physical restrictions have a minor influence. We contribute to the literature explaining co-creation in computer-mediated services by applying human behaviour models to assess the customers’ value expectations.",

A two-channel wireless in-ear EEG system was used to record EEG signals while subjects performed the task using a joystick to manipulate an object displayed on a monitor. A highly comparative time series analysis was employed on the processed signals to extract and select the top features for each subject individually. The features sets were trained and tested with support vector machines, random forest, linear discriminant analysis, subspace discriminant, and neural network to compare their performances. Models trained on two trials, each 14 minutes in duration and tested on the other trial were able to yield an accuracy of 79.30 ± 4.85% on average across the ten participants with an individualized moving average threshold filter and classifier.

Due to this they have great potential impact on future labor practices. However, powered exoskeleton controllers must first be developed that are able to directly assist with task objectives and truly collaborate with users. To address this need we present a shared autonomy control framework that separates the human and exoskeleton control objectives. This allows for creating a feedback-based exoskeleton controller that will help accomplish the user’s task goals rather than just assisting in specific motions. We introduce Positive Power control for the human-based controller that is designed to allow the human to directly command work that accomplishes the desired task. While a standard robotic controller can be used for the feedback-based control, we introduce ‘acceptance’ as a measure of how well the exoskeleton’s control objective matches the human’s. Both control objectives are implemented in an optimization-based Whole-Body-Control structure. Finally, we introduce a method to update the exoskeleton’s objectives to match the humans’ such that after operating for a time the exoskeleton can learn to assist the user in accomplishing their task. This framework is implemented on a 10-DoF upper-body powered exoskeleton. The results verify that the control framework works as desired and can form a basis for developing extended methods for directly improving cooperative control for powered exoskeletons.",

Major issues in cloud computing relate to security and load balancing. Load balance of a node relates to two important parameters namely request time and response time.

In this paper, an efficient resource provisioning approach is presented. This approach is inspired by autonomic computing model using Bayesian learning technique to make decisions about the increase and decrease in the dynamic scaling fog resources to accommodate the workload from IoT services in the fog computing environment. Also, we design an autonomous resource provisioning framework based on the generic fog environment three-tier architecture. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our solution under three workload traces.

These levels are described in terms of a Rail Automation Model based on previous automation theory (Parasuraman et al., 2000). Performance, subjective workload, and signaller activity were measured for each level of automation running under both normal operating conditions and abnormal, or disrupted, conditions. The results indicate that perceived workload, during both normal and disrupted phases of the experiment, decreased as the level of automation increased and performance was most consistent (i.e. showed the least variation between participants) with the highest level of automation. The results give a strong case in favour of automation, particularly in terms of demonstrating the potential for automation to reduce workload, but also suggest much benefit can achieved from a mid-level of automation potentially at a lower cost and complexity.",

Using empirical data to inform a neuroscience-based firing-rate model, we found that integration of negative feedback and network dynamics in a honeybee, Apis mellifera, hive demonstrates strong similarities to the neuronal interactions of the human brain, where very brief perturbations of feedback in the system result in more rapid and accurate decisions. We show that honey bees used an inhibitory ‘stop’ signal towards dancing honey bees that reduced both waggle dancing and waggle dance pheromone production. Stop signals were probably elicited by individuals with no individual knowledge of food quality change in the external environment. Therefore, we demonstrate that collective behaviour across different biological levels of organization exhibits a dynamic complex system that is self-organized, but is governed by simple feedback mechanisms, facilitating efficient group decision making by optimally aggregating individuals that have relatively limited cognitive capabilities within a society or cell in a multicellular organism. We discuss how despite being on two different levels of biological organization, both neurons in the brain and honeybee individuals, within the hive, can operate collectively, which is probably a result of convergent evolution.",

Mental workload ratings were then assigned to each horizontal curve to calculate the perception–reaction time needed by drivers to maintain control of their vehicles while negotiating these curves. Finally, a curve advisory speed was calculated based on the available sight distance and the mental workload perception–reaction time needed to ensure a safe driving environment. This study presents a unique approach that incorporates human factors, including the responses of drivers based on their perception of the driving environment, in the development of speed advisory systems.

One innovation of this paper is that an intelligent shared control architecture is developed based on the intelligent active inceptor technique, i.e., Smart Adaptive Flight Effective Cue (SAFE-Cue). A deep reinforcement learning approach namely Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method is chosen to design a gain adaptation mechanism for the SAFE-Cue module. By doing this, the gains of the SAFE-Cue will be intelligently tuned once nonlinear PIOs triggered; meanwhile, the human pilot will receive a force cue from the SAFE-Cue, and will consequently adapting his/her control policy. The second innovation of this paper is that the reward function of the DDPG based gain adaptation approach is constructed according to flying qualities. Under the premise of considering failure situation, task completion qualities and pilot workload are also taken into account. Finally, the proposed approach is validated using numerical simulation experiments with two types of scenarios: lower actuator rate limits and airframe damages. The Inceptor Peak Power-Phase (IPPP) metric is adopted to analyze the human-vehicle system simulation results. Results and analysis show that the DDPG based sharing control approach can well address nonlinear PIO problems consisting of Categories II and III PIO events.",6

A tool is needed that can proactively test these changes — Discrete Event Simulation (DES) may help. While computerized simulation models have existed before, there remains a gap to affirm the validity of these models. Objective: Develop an approach to creating a valid computerized simulation model that quantifies the effects of operational decisions on nurse-workload and quality-of-care. Methods: The DES model simulates the process of care delivery for nurses on a task-by-task basis. In an effort to validate this approach, the DES model was adapted to a real-world medical-surgical unit. Model inputs include: historical patient-care data; unit-layout; and programming logic, developed via focus-groups. Nurse-workload outcomes were distance-walked, task-in-queue, direct-care time, and nurse-movement. Quality-of-care outcomes included missed-care; and care-task waiting-time. The model is validated via internal validity checks and a field study that consisted of a ‘step-counter study’, a ‘MISSCARE survey’, ‘nurse job shadowing’, and a ‘time and motion study’. An Intraclass-correlation (ICC) and Spearman ranked correlation analysis were used to compare modelling outcomes to field-study outcomes. Results: The DES model, when adapted to a real-world medical-surgical unit, has been validated. The ICC coefficients show an “excellent” agreement of 0.99, 0.99, 0.85, 0.85, 0.84 between simulation and real-world outcomes, along with a “good” agreement of 0.86 for Spearman ranked correlation. Specific modelling results include a ‘distance walked’ of 7 to 10.6 km with a ‘direct care time’ of 8.3 to 10.4 h with a total of 77 to 84 trips for an average of 12 to 15 ‘tasks in queue’. Quality-of-care was represented by a ‘care task waiting time’ of 0.9 to 1 h that lead to 25 to 31 ‘missed-care’ tasks, where, 27% were ‘non-patient care’; and ‘missed-care delivery time’ was 2 to 2.9 h. Conclusion: This research provides a decision support-system that can help test and inform healthcare system policies that support both care quality and safety. By validating the DES model of a medical-surgical unit, we suggest that the modelling approach will also yield valid result when applied in similar settings. However, the modelling approach needs to be adapted to other healthcare settings and tested before concluding that this approach will consistently yield valid models.",

However, there is limited understanding of the driver acceptance of various types of in-vehicle HMIs and the impact of such systems on driving behaviour. Forty drivers participated in a simulated driving experiment to evaluate three variations of an eco-safe in-vehicle HMI: visual advice only; visual feedback only; or visual advice and feedback. To evaluate the impact of the different HMIs, subjective and objective measures were analysed, including fuel consumption, eco-safe driving behaviour, driver acceptance, and workload. Results indicate that all system types were associated with the relatively high levels of driver acceptance, with the advice only system accepted the most. While all system types produced relatively low levels of workload for drivers, systems involving feedback significantly increased the workload associated with using the interface. The findings suggest that the combined advice and feedback system has the potential to simultaneously reduce fuel consumption and improve eco-safe driving behaviour. Specifically, both advice and feedback appeared to be critical in encouraging positive changes in eco-safe driving behaviour. Our contribution can inform the design and development of future in-vehicle HMIs to improve eco-safe driving style that are accepted by drivers and have minimal adverse impacts on driver workload.",

However, there are certain tasks like soft fruit harvesting, where human skills are still required. In this case, the robot’s job is to cooperate/collaborate with human workers to alleviate their physical workload and improve harvesting efficiency. To accomplish that in a safe and reliable way, the robot should incorporate a safety system whose main goal is to reduce the risk of harming human co-workers during close human–robot interaction (HRI). In this context, this paper presents a theoretical study, addressing the safety risks of using collaborative robots in agricultural scenarios, especially in HRI situations when the robot’s safety system is not completely reliable and a component may fail. The agricultural scenarios discussed in this paper include automatic harvesting, logistics operations, crop monitoring, and plant treatment using UV-C light. A human injury assessment is conducted based on converting the HRI in each agricultural scenario into a formal mathematical representation. This representation is later implemented in a probabilistic model-checking tool. We then use this tool to perform a sensitivity analysis that allows us to determine the probability that a human may get injured according to the occurrence of failures in the robot’s safety or perception systems. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that an agricultural robot with a robust human perception system can still harm people if they are not well-trained to interact with the robot for certain scenarios. This illustrates how the probabilistic modeling methodology presented in this work can be used by safety engineers as a guideline to construct their own HRI models and then use the results of the model-checking to enhance the safety and reliability of their robot’s safety system architectures and on-site safety policies.",

This paper describes a non-intrusive, objective method to estimate mental workload in an immersive virtual reality system, through analysis of frequencies of pupil fluctuations. We tested changes in mental workload with a number of task-repetitions, level of predictability of the task and the effect of prior experience in predictable task performance, on mental workload of unpredictable task performance. Two measures were used to calculate mental workload: the ratio of Low Frequency to High Frequency components of pupil fluctuations, and the High Frequency alone, all extracted from the Power Spectrum Density of pupil fluctuations. Results show that mental workload decreases with a number of repetitions, creating a mode in which the brain acts as an automatic controller. Automaticity during training occurs only after a minimal number of repetitions, which once achieved, resulted in further improvements in the performance of unpredictable motor tasks, following training in a predictable task. These results indicate that automaticity is a central component in the transfer of skills from highly predictable to low predictable motor tasks. Our results suggest a potentially applicable method to brain–computer-interface systems that adapt to human mental workload, and provide intelligent automated support for enhanced performance.",1

This article describes an approach of building human operator behavior models to determine both, the current task of the operator, and derivations in task accomplishment, the latter observable by self-adapting strategies exposed during high workload conditions. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted utilizing a virtual flight simulator to stimulate pilot's workload during the guidance of multiple UAVs and to record their manual and visual interactions.

Shop scheduling is a subsection of scheduling related to manufacturing shops. The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) aims to minimize the makespan of a product value of the production process. This issue is related to optimizing the sequence of the jobs on appropriate machines. With globalization, manufacturing shops are scattered around the world. The distributed job shop scheduling problem (DJSP) tries to solve the optimizing sequence on these scattered facilities. DJSP is more complex than JSP. DJSP is solved by exact and heuristic solvers. Exact solvers more time-consuming processes for huge problems. In this work, a discrete version of the spotted hyena optimizer (DSHO) is proposed for solving DJSP. A workload-based facility order mechanism and a greedy heuristic approach are combined with the DSHO algorithm. 80 distributed job shop scheduling problems (DJSP) are solved by DSHO. For evaluating the performance of the DSHO, numerical results of the 480 (2 facilities to 7 facilities) large instances that are derived from well-known JSP benchmarks are compared with four different discrete meta-heuristic algorithms.

Little is known about the effect of the number of problems per encounter (NPPE) on the resulting clinician workload (CWL), as measured using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Methods We evaluated the relationship between NPPE and CWL across 608 adult patient visits, conducted by 31 clinicians, using hierarchical linear regression. Clinicians were interviewed about outlier visits to identify reasons for higher or lower than expected CWL. Results Mean NPPE was 3.30 ± 2.0 (sd) and CWL was 47.6 ± 18.4 from a maximum of 100. Mental demand, time demand and effort accounted for 71.5% of CWL. After adjustment for confounders, each additional problem increased CWL by 3.9 points (P < 0.001). Patient, problem, environmental and patient-physician relationship factors were qualitatively identified from interviews as moderators of this effect. Conclusion CWL is positively related to NPPE. Several modifiable factors may enhance or mitigate this effect. Our findings have implications for using a Human Factors (HF) approach to managing CWL.",

Also, artificial intelligence and automatic control techniques play an important role in enhancing the performance of mobile robot navigation. In contrast to previous simulation studies, this paper presents a new intelligent mobile robot for accomplishing multi-tasks by tracking red-green-blue (RGB) colored objects in a real experimental field. Moreover, a practical smart controller is developed based on adaptive fuzzy logic and custom proportional-integral-derivative (PID) schemes to achieve accurate tracking results, considering robot command delay and tolerance errors. The design of developed controllers implies some motion rules to mimic the knowledge of experienced operators. Twelve scenarios of three colored object combinations have been successfully tested and evaluated by using the developed controlled image-based robot tracker. Classical PID control failed to handle some tracking scenarios in this study. The proposed adaptive fuzzy PID control achieved the best accurate results with the minimum average final error of 13.8 cm to reach the colored targets, while our designed custom PID control is efficient in saving both average time and traveling distance of 6.6 s and 14.3 cm, respectively. These promising results demonstrate the feasibility of applying our developed image-based robotic system in a colored object-tracking environment to reduce human workloads.",2

However, autonomous human motion/intention perception is a primary barrier in e-waste remanufacturing. To address the research gap, this study combined experimental data collection with deep learning models for accurate disassembly task recognition. Over 570,000 frames of motion data were collected from inertial measurement units (IMU) worn by 22 participants.

To meet the rapidly increasing demand for e-commerce, more data centers are expected to provide new or significantly improve existing cloud services that can better support hybrid workloads (e.g. online purchase jobs and batch jobs that support ranking or recommendation systems). Successful cloud systems need to efficiently handle and quickly respond to huge volume of traffic with such hybrid workloads. Meanwhile, it is critical to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) for profitability. Improving system utilization is one of the effective techniques to achieve the twin goals of high performance and low TCO. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis on the 2017 and 2018 cluster traces released by Alibaba, which provides a case study about Alibaba's best practices in improving the performance and cost efficiency of its large-scale cloud systems by consolidating time-sensitive online service jobs with time-insensitive batch jobs. Our investigation indicates that the over-subscription (causing resource waste and low utilization) and under-subscription (causing performance degradation) problems co-exist in the current Alibaba system. We develop a simulator that allows us to evaluate possible solutions to address this problem and their impact on the performance, energy consumption, and TCO. Our experiments show that the estimated TCO can be reduced by $600,000 for the 2018 trace running on over 4,000 machines without compromising performance. The TCO can decrease by nearly $68 million if similar strategy is extrapolated to Alibaba's 432,000 web facing servers.",

In particular in aging populations workability is suffering increasingly from these epidemiological facts. Mainly Human Resources departments take care of this problem in Occupational Health Management programs, organizing activities, which do not touch, however, the work processes themselves. In work system design and Ergonomics, on the other hand the problem of providing a minimum of mobility and resistance during work is not addressed. The tools applied in ergonomic design provide typically upper limits of workload and do not limit workload at the lower end. Some of them are over-conservative, enforcing mechanization and automation, restricting unnecessarily the flexibility in design and preventing positive physical workload. This paper discusses the potentials and risks of integrating added motion and resistance into work processes in order to achieve a balanced physical load situation for staff members. For this purpose, it combines findings from Life Sciences with those of Ergonomics and suggests how to approach the required minimal physical load problem. An Added Time Concept (ATC) and Work Process Redesign (WPR) are proposed and discussed for supporting a balanced physical load. It is shown that such concepts can only be implemented based on an individual physical load management. It is also shown that WPR alone will not suffice to fulfill physical activity recommendations. It has to be combined with ATC and work separated training concepts (STC). WPR works best in case the workplace design provides for configurable or adaptive physical workload. Furthermore, it is concluded that more research on recommendable physical workload is needed and that the prevailing paradigms in Ergonomics have to be re-discussed in that respect.",

To close these external referral loops, referring primary care physicians (PCPs) need to receive patient information from consultants at different healthcare institutions. Although existing studies investigated the early phases of external referral loops, we lack sufficient knowledge about the closing phases of these loops. This knowledge could allow health care institutions to improve care coordination and rates of closed referral loops by implementing socio-technical interventions for patient information exchange throughout a referral loop. Human factors engineering (HFE) provides a systematic approach to advance our understanding of barriers perceived by physicians. Using HFE, our objective was to characterize referring and consulting physicians’ barriers to closing referral loops and implications for care. Methods This qualitative cross-sectional study included semi-structured interviews with referrers and external consultants. We used the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 framework to conduct rapid qualitative analyses, determining perceived barriers and related implications. Main measures were consultants’ and referrers’ perceptions of, and experiences with, barriers to external referrals. Results Six referring PCPs and 12 consultants participated from two healthcare systems and four medical specialties. Physicians perceived three main barriers in external referrals: receipt of excessive and unnecessary faxed documents, missing or delayed documentation, and organizational policies regarding information privacy interfering with closing the loop. Compared to internal referrals, physicians reported increased staff burden, patient frustration, and delays in diagnosis with external referrals. Consultants reported the ability to provide the same level of care to patients with internal or external referrals. However, consultants described communication breakdowns that prohibited confirmation of follow-up plan retrieval, initiation, or effectiveness. Conclusion Physicians reported technological and organizational barriers to closing cross-institutional referral loops. Promises of HIE technology for external referrals have not fully materialized. Among physicians and patients, retrieval and exchange of medical information increases perceived workload, burden, and frustration. These increases are not accurately captured by traditional organizational metrics. This study provides evidence that informs future human factors engineering research to address perceived barriers and guide future HIE design or implementation.",

Operators are increasingly reliant on technology to aid and improve harvest performance. New harvest technology is under development that will advise harvest operators on the proper adjustment of machine harvest settings, as well as automatically adjust these machine settings without operator intervention, improving the harvest performance of the machine, and reducing the cognitive load of the operator. In this work a high-fidelity, interactive harvest combine simulator is used to understand how harvest operators currently use existing harvest technology, and to evaluate the performance improvements provided by new prototype machine control algorithms and human control interface designs. The interactive harvest simulator is used to assess an intermediate advising step for machine controls adjustment compared with a path using fully autonomous machine adjustment. Testing novel harvest technologies using the virtual environment of the combine simulator introduces a specific set of constraints and challenges that are not found in most other vehicle simulation applications, including the need for accurate physical and visual crop flow representations and a requirement for realistic machine responses to a wide variety of operator input commands. Using a high-fidelity combine simulator for testing allows unique harvest scenarios to be repeated by experienced operators in a controlled virtual environment. This study evaluates operator acceptance, performance, and feedback for two novel pieces of harvest technology, Advisor and Director. Advisor is an operator-in-the-loop system providing feedback on proper machine control adjustments during normal harvest operations. Director is designed to continuously monitor the overall harvest health and autonomously adjust the combine harvest settings. In this study, operators harvested the same virtual field twice, first using Advisor, and a second time using Director. Operators overwhelmingly perceived both the Advisor and Director systems as optimizing the harvest performance of the combine and recommended both Advisor and Director. The results presented in this work show that both systems improved the perceived harvest performance, although the Advisor was not as highly rated. Participants recommended the automated nature of Director, and both operator feedback and physiological measures indicates that this harvest technology reduced the cognitive load of the operator. This work demonstrates two main points. First, the interactive combine simulator can be used for evaluating novel harvest technology in the lab. Second, that operators can quickly acclimate to automation within the combine and were able to harvest in a more productive manner when using higher levels of automation.",

It changes the way human interacts with systems. We have less empirical knowledge about its potential negative effects on human. In our study, we compared conventional and digital main control rooms (MCRs) in nuclear power plants (NPPs) from a task complexity perspective. Complexity factors in MCRs were quantified in terms of three aspects, frequency of occurrence, complexity induced by their being, and impact caused by them. A total of 69 licensed operators participated in the study. The study consists of two parts. In Part I, overall results and analysis were reported. Generally, operators in digital MCRs perceived higher frequency and higher impact of complexity factors than those in conventional MCRs, no matter in abnormal/emergency or normal situations. Operators in digital MCRs perceived higher complexity than those in conventional MCRs in abnormal/emergency situations. These findings suggest that operators in digital MCRs experience higher complexity and workload which may reduce their reliability. These findings imply that we should caution the side-effects of ubiquitous digitalization in complex industrial systems. Relevance to industry Digital technologies are widely deployed in the nuclear industry. They change the working environments in which operators interact with NPP systems. There is insufficient research on operator experience on the changes brought by technological developments in NPP control rooms. Our findings imply that we should take care of the potential negative effect of digitalization on operator working environments.",

However, recent studies suggest using auditory-vocal systems can be mentally taxing for drivers, and require long interaction times. Low accuracy and menu complexity are believed to negatively affect the usability of the system, but a systematic analysis of the role of different design components on driver workload and user experience within a real-world setting is missing. This study investigates the role of voice system design components in determining levels of driver workload with participants driving twelve on-road vehicles and interacting with on-board infotainment systems. Menu depth, delay times and system accuracy are recorded for twelve different auditory-vocal systems, and one aggregate score is assigned to each system. Total delay time and menu depth were found to be significant predictors of task duration time and mental workload. Longer delay times also had a direct effect on lower usability ratings, measured by the System Usability Scale and sentiment analysis. Delay times recorded on seven additional vehicles were used to validate the regression model for task duration. This study provides findings of primary importance for researchers and automotive manufacturers to be used in the assessment and development of in-vehicle auditory-vocal systems.",

Thus, electronic support systems intend to reduce ATCos' workload. Automatic speech recognition can extract controller command elements from verbal clearances to deliver automatic input for air traffic control systems, thereby avoiding manual input. Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) with high command recognition rates and low error rates has proven to dramatically reduce ATCos’ workload and increase capacity in approach scenarios. However, ABSR needs accurate hypotheses on expected commands and accurate extractions of command annotations from utterance transcriptions to achieve the required performance. Based on the experience of implementation for approach control, a hypotheses generator and a command extractor have been developed for speech recognition applications regarding tower control communication to face current and future challenges in the aerodrome environment. Three human-in-the-loop multiple remote tower simulation studies were performed with 16 ATCos from Hungary, Lithuania, and Finland at DLR Braunschweig from 2017 to 2019. Roughly 100 h of speech with corresponding radar data were recorded. Around 6000 speech utterances resulting in 16,000 commands have been manually transcribed and annotated. Some parts of the data have been used for training prediction models and command extraction algorithms. Other parts were used for evaluation of command prediction and command extraction. The automatic command extractor achieved a command extraction rate of 96.7%. The hypotheses generator showed operational feasibility with a sufficiently low command prediction error rate of 7.3%.",

A biomechanical model of work-cycle loading is combined with a discrete event simulation model which provides work cycle patterns over the shift resulting in a load-time trace for the entire shift. This trace was tested with four different muscle endurance-recovery model pairs yielding a fatigue-time history for the entire shift. An electronics assembly case with shift-long perceived fatigue data was compared to the simulation model results. Sensitivity testing of the input work-rest ratios found the best correlation (r2 = 0.84) at 17% of the modeled rest level. The need for this adjustment is discussed in terms of limitations of available muscle endurance and recovery models. Muscle model limitations notwithstanding, this approach allows system designers to understand the mechanical exposure and fatigue-related effects of proposed alternatives in system design stages and can contribute to ‘Virtual Human Factors’ approaches for pro-active ergonomics capability. Relevance to Industry This paper demonstrates an approach to quantifying operator exposure patterns and fatigue levels using dynamic simulations of the proposed operations. This allows system designers to understand the ergonomic impacts of proposed alternatives in system design.

Traditional approaches to autonomous driving have heavily relied on conventional machine learning methodologies, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for tasks such as perception, decision-making, and control. Presently, major companies such as Tesla, Waymo, Uber, and Volkswagen Group (VW) leverage neural networks for advanced perception and autonomous decision-making. However, concerns have been raised about the escalating computational requirements of training these neural models, primarily in terms of energy consumption and environmental impact. In the situation of optimisation and sustainability, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the temporal processing of the human brain, have come forth as a third-generation of neural networks, famed for their energy efficiency, potential for handling real-time driving scenarios and processing temporal information efficiently. However, SNNs have not yet achieved the performance levels of their predecessors in critical AD tasks, partly due to the intricate dynamics of neurons, their non-differentiable spike operations, and the lack of specialised benchmark workloads and datasets, among others. This paper examines the principles, models, learning rules, and recent advancements of SNNs in the AD domain. Neuromorphic hardware, hand in hand with SNNs, shows potential but has challenges in accessibility, cost, integration, and scalability. This examination aims to bridge gaps by providing a comprehensive understanding of SNNs in the AD field. It emphasises the role of SNNs in shaping the future of AD while considering optimisation and sustainability.",

Assembly operations are recognized with high potential to increase productivity by using the best skills of humans and robots in a combination. Components and parts to be assembled need to be structured and presented to the robot in a known location and orientation. The process of presenting parts to the robot for assembly tasks is referred to as parts feeding. Feeding system needs to be adaptable to dynamics of parts’ design, shape, location, and orientation to have flexibility in the production. The traditional automation methods for parts feeding are part-specific mechanical devices e.g. vibratory bowl feeders which are inflexible towards part variations. This comes as a hindrance in getting maximum advantage of the flexibility potential of human-robot collaboration in assembly. The recent years have seen advances in machine vision and has potential for feeding applications. This paper explores the developments in machine-vision for flexible feeding systems for human-robot assembly cells.

It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers’ performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces.",

Distinguished from traditional scheduling model that only considers sequential operation precedence constraints defined by process routings, FJSSP-JPC takes additional hierarchical job precedence constraints defined by Bills-of-Materials (BOMs) of final products into account. A mixed integer programming mathematical model is formulated to describe FJSSP-JPC. To represent feasible solutions that satisfy the hybrid precedence constraints, a novel three-vector encoding scheme and a job precedence repair mechanism based on binary tree are elaborated. Subsequently, this paper proposes an efficient evolutionary multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (EMOGWO) to tackle FJSSP-JPC with minimizing the objectives of makespan, maximum machine workload and total machine workload simultaneously.

The emergence of highly automated vehicles (HAVs) may have the potential to allow older adults to drive longer and safer. In HAVs, when operating in automated mode, drivers can be completely disengaged from driving, but occasionally they may be required to take back the control of the vehicle. The human-machine interfaces in HAVs play an important role in the safe and comfortable usage of HAVs. To date, only limited research has explored how to design age-friendly HMIs in HAVs and evaluate their effectiveness. This study designed three HMI concepts based on older drivers’ requirements, and conducted a driving simulator investigation with 76 drivers (39 older drivers and 37 younger drivers) to evaluate the effect and relative merits of these HMIs on drivers’ takeover performance, workload and attitudes. Results showed that the ‘R + V’ HMI (informing drivers of vehicle status together with providing the reasons for the manual driving takeover request) led to better takeover performance, lower perceived workload and highly positive attitudes, and is the most beneficial and effective HMI. In addition, The ‘V’ HMI (verbally informing the drivers about vehicle status, including automation mode and speed, before the manual driving takeover request) also had a positive effect on drivers’ takeover performance, perceived workload and attitudes. However, the ‘R’ HMI (solely informing drivers about the reasons for takeover as part of the takeover request) affected older and younger drivers differently, and resulted in deteriorations in performance and more risky takeover for both older and younger drivers compared to the baseline HMI. Moreover, significant age difference was observed in the takeover performance and perceived workload. Above all, this research highlights the significance of taking account older drivers’ requirements into the design of HAVs and the importance of collaboration between automated vehicle and cooperative ITS research communities.",

The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.",

To meet the challenge, there is an increasing number of enterprises adopting distributed storage systems. Frequently, in these systems, storage nodes intensively holding hotspot data could become system bottlenecks while storage nodes without hotspot data might result in low utilization of computing resource. This stems from the fact that almost all the typical distributed storage systems only provide data-amount-oriented balancing mechanisms without considering the different access load of data. To eliminate the system bottlenecks and optimize the resource utilization, there is a demand for such distributed storage systems to employ a workload balancing and adaptive resource management framework. In this paper, we propose a framework of workload balancing and resource management for Swift, a widely used and typical distributed storage system on cloud. In this framework, we design workload monitoring and analysis algorithms for discovering overloaded and underloaded nodes in the cluster. To balance the workload among those nodes, Split, Merge and Pair Algorithms are implemented to regulate physical machines while Resource Reallocate Algorithm is designed to regulate virtual machines on cloud. In addition, by leveraging the mature architecture of distributed storage systems, the framework resides in the hosts and operates through API interception. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments to evaluate it. And the experimental results show the framework can achieve its goals.",

However, our observation of supply chain practice reveals that warehousing decisions are not included when developing a distribution plan for the supply chain. This lack of integration has resulted in a substantial variation in workload (42–220%) at our industry partner’s warehouse costing them millions of dollars. To address this real-world challenge, we introduce the warehouse-inventory-transportation problem (WITP) of determining an optimal distribution plan from vendors to customers via one or more warehouses in order to minimize the total distribution cost. We present a nonlinear integer programming model for the WITP considering supply chains with multiple vendors, stores, products, and time-periods, and one warehouse. The model also considers worker congestion at the warehouse that could affect worker productivity. A heuristic based on iterative local search is developed to solve industry-sized problems with up to 500 stores and 1000 products. Our experiments indicate that the distribution plans obtained via the WITP, as compared to a sequential approach, result in a substantial reduction in workload variance at the warehouse, while considerably reducing the total distribution cost. These plans, however, are sensitive to aisle configuration and technology at the warehouse, and the level and productivity of temporary workers.",2

This paper addresses these problems and proposes an online anomaly detection approach for Web applications. We present an incremental clustering algorithm for training workload patterns online, and employ the local outlier factor (LOF) in the recognized workload pattern to detect anomalies. In addition, we locate the anomalous metrics with the Student's t-test method. We evaluated our approach on a testbed running the TPC-W industry-standard benchmark.

These Embedded IoT devices are mostly battery-driven. It has been analyzed that usage of Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) centered core memory is considered the most significant source of high energy utility in Embedded IoT devices. For achieving the low power consumption in these devices, Non-volatile memory (NVM) devices such as Parameter Random Access Memory (PRAM) and Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random-Access Memory (STT-RAM) are becoming popular among main memory alternatives in embedded IoT devices because of their features such as high thickness, byte addressability, high scalability and low power intake. Additionally, Non-volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) is widely adopted to save the data in the embedded IoT devices. NVM, flash memories have a limited lifetime, so it is mandatory to adopt intelligent optimization in managing the NVRAM-based embedded devices using an intelligent controller while considering the endurance issue. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a powerful, lightweight machine learning-based workload-adaptive write schemes of the NVRAM, which can increase the lifetime and reduce the energy consumption of the processors. The proposed system consists of three phases like Workload Characterization, Intelligent Compression and Memory Allocators. These phases are used for distributing the write-cycles to NVRAM, following the energy-time consumption and number of data bytes.

A driving simulator study was conducted to examine the impact of non-driving related tasks on drivers’ ability to take over vehicle control. The task consisted of reading or proofreading a text (low vs. high visual-cognitive task load) on a tablet which was either handheld or mounted in the vehicle (low vs. high manual task load). Data from 95 participants (mean age 38years, 47 females) were used to examine reaction times and take-over quality in time-critical steering and braking maneuvers. Manual task load was found to prolong reaction times and to deteriorate take-over quality. Surprisingly, drivers needed even longer for the first gaze at the roadway when holding the tablet in their hands. As expected, these effects were stronger in the steering compared to the braking maneuver. Effects of cognitive task load were found to be dependent on the type of driver intervention. While reaction times and take-over quality deteriorated with increasing cognitive load in the steering maneuver, hardly any effects were found in the braking maneuver. A possible explanation for this surprising finding could be that especially drivers who are intensively engaging in non-driving related tasks spontaneously react with braking to defuse the situation and gain more time. It is thus argued that cognitively demanding non-driving related tasks during automated driving do not necessarily lead to deteriorated take-over performance. Depending on situational characteristics like the required reaction or the perceptual complexity of the situation, these might have different effects on the drivers’ ability to take over.",

The new trend of mass customization brings a higher level of disturbances and uncertainties to production planning. Traditional manufacturing systems analyze data and schedule orders in a centralized architecture, which is inefficient and unreliable for the overdependence on central controllers and limited communication channels. Internet of things (IoT) and cloud technologies make it possible to build a distributed manufacturing architecture such as the multi-agent system (MAS). Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used to solve scheduling problems in the manufacturing setting. However, it is difficult for scheduling algorithms to process high-dimensional data in a distributed system with heterogeneous manufacturing units. Therefore, this paper presents new cyber-physical integration in smart factories for online scheduling of low-volume-high-mix orders. First, manufacturing units are interconnected with each other through the cyber-physical system (CPS) by IoT technologies. Attributes of machining operations are stored and transmitted by radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Second, we propose an AI scheduler with novel neural networks for each unit (e.g., warehouse, machine) to schedule dynamic operations with real-time sensor data. Each AI scheduler can collaborate with other schedulers by learning from their scheduling experiences. Third, we design new reward functions to improve the decision-making abilities of multiple AI schedulers based on reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated in a smart factory by real-world case studies. Experimental results show that the new architecture for smart factories not only improves the learning and scheduling efficiency of multiple AI schedulers but also effectively deals with unexpected events such as rush orders and machine failures.",

A next milestone is highly automated driving (HAD), a system that automates both longitudinal and lateral motion. We investigated the effects of ACC and HAD on drivers’ workload and situation awareness through a meta-analysis and narrative review of simulator and on-road studies. Based on a total of 32 studies, the unweighted mean self-reported workload was 43.5% for manual driving, 38.6% for ACC driving, and 22.7% for HAD (0%=minimum, 100=maximum on the NASA Task Load Index or Rating Scale Mental Effort). Based on 12 studies, the number of tasks completed on an in-vehicle display relative to manual driving (100%) was 112% for ACC and 261% for HAD. Drivers of a highly automated car, and to a lesser extent ACC drivers, are likely to pick up tasks that are unrelated to driving. Both ACC and HAD can result in improved situation awareness compared to manual driving if drivers are motivated or instructed to detect objects in the environment. However, if drivers are engaged in non-driving tasks, situation awareness deteriorates for ACC and HAD compared to manual driving. The results of this review are consistent with the hypothesis that, from a Human Factors perspective, HAD is markedly different from ACC driving, because the driver of a highly automated car has the possibility, for better or worse, to divert attention to secondary tasks, whereas an ACC driver still has to attend to the roadway.",

The effects of these work organization factors on subjective fatigue or discomfort were also analyzed. This review was based on relevant articles published in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The studies included in this review were performed in humans and assessed muscle fatigue in upper limbs. 14 articles were included in the systematic review. Few studies were performed in a real work environment and the most common methods used to assess muscle fatigue were surface electromyography (EMG). No consistent results were found related to the effects of job rotation on muscle activity and subjective measurements of fatigue. Rest breaks had some positive effects, particularly in perceived discomfort. The increase in work pace reveals a higher muscular load in specific muscles. The duration of experiments and characteristics of participants appear to be the factors that most have influenced the results. Future research should be focused on the improvement of the experimental protocols and instrumentation, in order to the outcomes represent adequately the actual working conditions.

The city traffic control center (TCC) is a complex work system, and it is important to describe MW as a condition related to this. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mental workload of operators while monitoring traffic loads in the city TCC. Methods Electroencephalography and electrooculography data were collected from 16 operators while performing their daily work, in four conditions: resting state, low traffic density, high traffic density, and recovery. The Simplified-Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (S-SWAT) was used to evaluate the subjective workload of operators. Results The findings indicate that operators experience a larger mental workload during high traffic density than during low traffic density (p < 0.001). TCC stressors led to significant changes in EEG bands, such as theta, alpha, and eye activity. Significant differences were observed for subjective ratings of MW (p < 0.001). Conclusion Although the working situations of TCC operators are repeated daily, their mental fatigue and stress level gradually increase, leading to deterioration in their mental health. It may be necessary periodically to monitor their mental health and to consider their organizational behavior during traffic density monitoring. Relevance to industry complex work systems have increased the requirement for many operators to conduct mental tasks in real work conditions such as city traffic density monitoring. When evaluating such workplaces, it is important to identify situations requiring increased mental workload that might impose additional stress on operators, decreasing their performance. Based on the results, the traffic control center director would be aware of the MW condition of the operators.",

Owing to the inherent non-rigid nature of garments, current methods prioritise flexible deformation through appearance flow with high degrees of freedom. However, existing appearance flow estimation methods solely focus on the correlation of local feature information. While this strategy successfully avoids the extensive computational effort associated with the direct computation of the global information correlation of feature maps, it leads to challenges in garments adapting to large deformation scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose the GIC-Flow framework, which obtains appearance flow by calculating the global information correlation while reducing computational regression. Specifically, our proposed global streak information matching module is designed to decompose the appearance flow into horizontal and vertical vectors, effectively propagating global information in both directions. This innovative approach considerably diminishes computational requirements, contributing to an enhanced and efficient process. In addition, to ensure the accurate deformation of local texture in garments, we propose the local aggregate information matching module to aggregate information from the nearest neighbours before computing the global correlation and to enhance weak semantic information. Comprehensive experiments conducted using our method on the VITON and VITON-HD datasets show that GIC-Flow outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in cases involving complex garment deformation.",

These results can be used in the workstation-designing phase. When driving a tractor for a long time, the position of the human body influences the working comfort and can lead to disorders. To assess the working comfort on a mobile workstation as well as a farm tractor, surface electromyography was used. Based on the given parameter maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), the lowest workload for the forearm, arm and wrist was determined, considering the position of the steering column and the angle between arm and forearm (elbow angle). Experimental tests showed that the most comfortable position for a driver's hands was recorded when the tested elbow angle was 100°, as well as when the inclination angle of the steering column against the horizontal plane was approximately 50°. In this study, the MVC parameter was determined on the basis of muscle tension amplitude related to the maximum muscle isometric contraction. Based on this parameter, the percentage of developed force of tested muscle in relation to its maximum force-generating capabilities was described. This approach helped to define a relationship between human body position and generated load in human muscles.",

Therefore, this study investigated whether worked examples and modeling examples with and without a visible model would be equally effective in fostering learning of a problem-solving task. In Experiment 1, secondary education students (N=78) learned how to solve a probability calculation problem by watching two videos that, depending on the assigned condition, provided worked examples (written text, pictures of problem states), modeling examples with a visible model (spoken text, a demonstration of the task), or modeling examples without a visible model (spoken text, pictures of problem states). Results showed that all three conditions were equally effective at fostering learning, near transfer, effort reduction, self-efficacy, and perceived competence. Experiment 2 (N=134) replicated these results with a younger student population that only studied one example. These findings suggest that the format of examples does not affect learning outcomes for this task; future research should investigate whether this would generalize to other problem-solving tasks.",

The design of these complex socio-technical systems is continuously evolving to accommodate larger populations, and their adaptation is essential in supporting the successful and sustainable development of cities and regions. An essential part of this adaptation includes working to increase passenger safety and to minimise their risk of injury. With this focus, key objectives of the current study were to identify the causes of slip, trip and fall (STF) incidents attributable to the rail user and to train and station characteristics. An investigation of historical STF records of 1247 train and station incidents in two Australian jurisdictions was conducted. Various contributing factors to STF events were identified, including locations such as stairs, ramps, escalators, the train's entry and exit step, doorway areas, and passenger running or rushing. A mixed-method field study was then conducted at three train stations and on trains. To further investigate the contributing factors, participants (N = 40) wore an eye tracker as they navigated the stations and trains. The research illustrates that their continuous search for information, and a disconnect between the information needed and the information provided, might be a cause of passenger distraction and an increase in their risky behaviour. Therefore, we suggest that improvements in information design to reduce the high visual workload for passengers might also reduce the incidence of STFs.",

Alarms are used to inform the operator about possible process deviations from the normal so that the operator can take appropriate corrective action. Alarm activation and the corresponding response from the operator together serve as one of the critical layers of protection during the occurrence of a process fault. With the rapid advancement in control systems technology over the past few decades, the number of process sensors deployed for a particular plant has dramatically increased. In addition, due to the ease in configuring the alarms in control systems, the number of alarms in a plant has also gone up. This has led to poor system performance, increase in the operator workload due to alarm overload, and catastrophic incidents in some cases. This review paper discusses such issues, provides details about the existing regulations, standards and guidelines, and challenges related to alarm management. In addition, it summarizes some of the open research problems in the area of effective alarm management.",

We examined the novel question of whether increased automation transparency improves the accuracy of automation use under conditions with/without concurrent (non-automated assisted) task demands. Participants completed an uninhabited vehicle (UV) management task whereby they assigned the best UV to complete missions. Automation advised the best UV but was not always correct. Concurrent non-automated task demands decreased the accuracy of automation use, and increased decision time and perceived workload. With no concurrent task demands, increased transparency which provided more information on how the automation made decisions, improved the accuracy of automation use. With concurrent task demands, increased transparency led to higher trust ratings, faster decisions, and a bias towards agreeing with automation. These outcomes indicate increased reliance on highly transparent automation under conditions with concurrent task demands and have potential implications for human-automation teaming design.",

However, limited research has been done to understand user interaction with AR interfaces, which may lead to poor usability, risk of occupational hazards, and low acceptance of AR systems. This paper uses a theoretically-driven approach to interaction design to investigate the impact of different AR modalities in terms of information mode (i.e. video vs. 3D animation) and interaction modality (i.e. hand-gesture vs. voice command) on user performance, workload, eye gaze behaviours, and usability during a maintenance assembly task. The results show that different information modes have distinct impacts compared to paper-based maintenance, in particular, 3D animation led to a 14% improvement over the video instructions in task completion time. Moreover, insights from eye gaze behaviours such as number of fixations and transition between Areas of Interest (AOIs) revealed the differences in attention switching and task comprehension difficulty with the choice of AR modalities. While, subjective user perceptions highlight some ergonomic issues such as misguidance and overreliance, which must be considered and addressed from the joint cognitive systems’ (JCSs) perspective and in line with the predictions derived from the Multiple Resources Model.",

Currently, most of CSDs are mainly manipulated by human operators, and a large amount of instrument data needs to be monitored in real time in case of unforeseen accidents. In order to reduce the heavy workload of the operators, we propose a data-driven offline learning approach, named Preprocessing-Prediction-Learning Control (PPLC), for obtaining the optimal control policy of the excavating operation of CSDs. The proposed framework consists of three modules, i.e., a data preprocessing module, a dynamics prediction module realized by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a deep reinforcement learning based control module. The first module is responsible for filtering out irrelevant variables through correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction of raw data. The second module works as a state transition function that provides the dynamics prediction of the excavating operation of a CSD. To realize the learning control, the third module employs the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to control the swing speed during the excavating operation. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can provide an effective and reliable solution to the automated excavating control of a CSD.",

For this purpose a fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, which is an extension of the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) approach using Ordered Fuzzy Numbers (OFNs), is used. The paper includes a case study of the application of this method as a flow controller for the transport trolley in a flexible manufacturing system. The immediate aim of control is to choose the transport trolley’s destination (production line). A set of criteria (parameters) for the evaluation of the flow’s destination is suggested, related to time efficiency and equal workload of machines. The advantage of the proposed method is its ability to distinguish the type of criteria (benefit, cost) by using the orientation of ordered fuzzy numbers. An example of calculations using the presented method is shown and the results of the method, based on the simulation of a manufacturing system, are presented. The results thus obtained are compatible with flexible automation. In order to test the FTOPSIS method with OFNs the proposed flow control method is compared with the TOPSIS method and other simple control methods (dispatching rules). The proposed method is more efficient than the methods used for comparison and can be effective and efficient for diversified production and fast, automatic changeovers on production lines.",

However, several existing transfer learning methods assume identical feature spaces between the source and the target domains. This assumption limits the possible real-world applications of such methods, since two separate, although related, domains could be described by totally different feature spaces. Heterogeneous transfer learning methods aim to overcome this limitation, but they usually i) make other assumptions on the features, such as requiring the same number of features, ii) are not generally able to distribute the workload over multiple computational nodes, iii) cannot work in the Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning setting, which we also considered in this study, or iv) their applicability is limited to specific application domains, i.e., they are not general-purpose methods. In this manuscript, we present a novel distributed heterogeneous transfer learning method, implemented in Apache Spark, that overcomes all the above-mentioned limitations. Specifically, it is able to work also in the PU learning setting by resorting to a clustering-based approach, and can align totally heterogeneous feature spaces, without exploiting peculiarities of specific application domains. Moreover, our distributed approach allows us to process large source and target datasets. Our experimental evaluation was performed in three different application domains that can benefit from transfer learning approaches, namely the reconstruction of the human gene regulatory network, the prediction of cerebral stroke in hospital patients, and the prediction of customer energy consumption in power grids. The results show that the proposed approach is able to outperform 4 state-of-the-art heterogeneous transfer learning approaches and 3 baselines, and exhibits ideal performances in terms of scalability.",

Participants performed an ulnar deviation task at a frequency of 15 repetitions per minute for seven hours: at their psychophysically chosen acceptable torque (day 1), and at 25% above the acceptable torque (day 2). Hemodynamic responses (Tissue oxygenation index [TOI] and Tissue Hemoglobin Index [THI]) from the carpi ulnaris flexor and extensor muscle regions of the right hand were collected for the last 5 min of every hour of task performance. Participants selected their acceptable torque as 3.97 ± 2.5 N.m. (minimum: 1.0 and maximum: 9.8 N.m.). During task performance from 1 to 7 h, both tissue hemodynamic responses were not influenced by increasing the workload to above their acceptable level (P > 0.05). Therefore, increasing the acceptable load by 25% will not diminish the adequate supply and delivery of oxygen to the muscle regions recruited. When blood flow to the forearm was occluded (for 1 min) immediately after the final repetition of the seven-hour task, the half-time recovery, a noninvasive indicator of muscle oxidative capacity, was not significantly different between workloads (average TOI: 10.2 s at the acceptable workload versus 10.8 s at 25% above the acceptable workload, P > 0.05; and average THI: 10.1 s at the acceptable workload versus 10.0 s at 25% above the acceptable workload, P > 0.05). This is a remarkable finding as we hypothesized that recovery in each muscle might be longer for a workload that is greater than the acceptable level for an individual. The fact that hemodynamic responses were also similar during recovery from the task performance across both workloads imply the protectiveness of the psychophysical approach in assessing the physical ability of workers without anoxia or tissue hypoxia, thereby posing no injury to the muscles recruited. Relevance to industry Scientific discipline of “Psychophysics” has been instrumental in developing safe levels of workload to workers exposed to variety of occupational activities without risking injury or adverse health effects. The present optical spectroscopy-related study is an excellent example of integrating two scientific disciplines: Psychophysics and Work physiology in examining the influence of a seven-hour repetitive work exposure on muscle hemodynamics of the upper extremity.",2

Of the different sorts of noise and vibration, which a brake system may generate, squeal as an irritating high-frequency noise costs the manufacturers significantly. Despite considerable research that has been conducted on brake squeal, the root cause of squeal is still not fully understood. The most common assumption, however, is mode-coupling. Complex eigenvalue analysis is the most widely used approach to the analysis of brake squeal problems. One of the major drawbacks of this technique, nevertheless, is that the effects of variability and uncertainty are not included in the results. Apparently, uncertainty and variability are two inseparable parts of any brake system. Uncertainty is mainly caused by friction, contact, wear and thermal effects while variability mostly stems from the manufacturing process, material properties and component geometries. Evaluating the effects of uncertainty and variability in the complex eigenvalue analysis improves the predictability of noise propensity and helps produce a more robust design. The biggest hurdle in the uncertainty analysis of brake systems is the computational cost and time. Most uncertainty analysis techniques rely on the results of many deterministic analyses. A full finite element model of a brake system typically consists of millions of degrees-of-freedom and many load cases. Running time of such models is so long that automotive industry is reluctant to do many deterministic analyses. This paper, instead, proposes an efficient method of uncertainty propagation via surrogate modelling. A surrogate model of a brake system is constructed in order to reproduce the outputs of the large-scale finite element model and overcome the issue of computational workloads. The probability distribution of the real part of an unstable mode can then be obtained by using the surrogate model with a massive saving of computational time and cost. The established model can be used subsequently for design, reliability analysis and optimisation.",

The discovery of a shared neural network between action observation and execution (Action-Observation Network) led us to hypothesize that watching human motor action might improve cognitive and motor aspects of performance and proneness for exercise. Design/Methods Sixty participants viewed a Motor (M) (n = 30) or a Non-Motor (NM) (n = 30) movie with strong or weak content of motoric features of human action, respectively. Performance in d2 Attention test, Fitts' Motor task, and a Proneness for Exercise Visual Analog Scale was assessed before and after movie visualization, in a cross-sectional study. Psychophysiological measures were recorded throughout the experiment. Results Our results demonstrate an increase in proneness for exercise, and greater improvement in attention-related cognitive aspects in the M group. The aforementioned benefits of action observation did not modulate motor performance. A mental effort deployment was associated to the decrease in heart rate variability after visualization of the NM movie. This was not conducive to attention channeling on task performance. Conversely, M movie observation seemed to be associated to a cognitive load release, affording attention deployment for the resolution of the subsequent tasks. Conclusions It seems that some benefits associated to physical practice can result from the mere visualization of movies with human motor action content. These are the improvement in attention-related cognitive skills associated to psychophysiological changes that support a disengagement from mental effort. Crucially, the observation of exercise behavior seems to be a key factor for exercise adherence.",1

This research investigates pilot's visual parameters while interacted with two different designs of crew alerting system by eye tracking technology. There are 24 aviation professionals that participated in this experiment including commercial pilots, private pilots and avionic engineers. Compared with traditional design, the new integrated design applied proximity compatibility principles to assist pilots in searching necessary information to deal with urgent situations. The results demonstrated that the integrated design is superior to traditional design in providing accurate instructions as determined by visual behaviors. However, the integrated design increases pilot's situation awareness by redirecting attention from current task to the most critical task with the cost of a longer total fixation duration time. Pilot's visual parameters demonstrated significant differences while interacting with PFD mainly numeric, ND mostly by symbols and EICAS with presented text messages. Therefore, flight deck design has to adopt a holistic approach as pilot's visual attentions is shifting among all types of different displays to gain situation awareness rather than focus on only one display. The design of integrated EICAS can provide detailed instructions to deal with urgent situations which induced higher cognitive loads as pilot's pupil dilation is significant bigger than interacted with traditional design. By eye tracking technology, it is applicable to design human-centred flight decks to improve safety and human performance in aviation.",

While in-vehicle driver advanced systems are designed to support a single driving task (e.g. reducing emissions), they also imply the adoption of a different driving behavior and different driving attitudes in order to be efficient. Adopting for the first time a new driving style could affect driver's acceptance and undermine new technologies' efficacy. Purpose of the present research is to measure and evaluate the user's responses to first-time use of eco-driving assisting technology. Driver's performances in a virtual simulator were compared between experimental and a control group. The actual driving parameters and CO2 emissions were recorded and compared to the optimal eco-driving style calculated by CarMaker software. The cognitive costs of the new driving style were measured by changes in the modulation of autonomic nervous system and NASA-TLX workload scale. Acceptance of the assisted driving style and general eco-friendly attitudes were analyzed by self-reported measures. Results show that being exposed for the first time to eco-driving technology produces a reduction of cumulate fuel consumption only due to speed reduction, and not to changes in the driving style parameters, as recommended by the assisting software. Overall CO2 emissions of eco-driving group were not different from the control group. Rather, the first time use of the eco-driving assistance increases perceived fatigue and the physiological cardiac autonomic balance related to increased workload over time. These difficulties show that eco-driving style cannot be simply adopted by following the assistance device indications. It seems rather a process, which requires specific support during in the first driving-interaction with eco-driving technology. The design of assistance device that aims to change the driving style, could benefit from the measurement of the user's workload to avoid primacy effect that potentially undermine technology efficacy in supporting user-sustainable behaviors.",

However, the snake robot teleoperation remains a nontrivial task due to the unique locomotion mechanism (e.g., helical motion) and the constraints of the workplaces including the low visibility and indistinguishable features. Most snake robot feedback systems are based on the live camera view only. It is hard for the human operator to develop a correct spatial understanding of the remote workplace, leading to problems such as disorientation and motion sickness in snake robot teleoperation. This study designs and evaluates an innovative haptic assistant system for snake robot teleoperation in the in-pipe inspection. An upper-body haptic suit with 40 vibrators on both the front and back sides of the human operator was developed to generate haptic feedback corresponding to the bottom and up sides of the snake robot, transferring the egocentric sensation of the snake robot to the human operator. A human-subject experiment (n = 31) was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the developed system. The results indicate that the proposed haptic assistant system outperformed other feedback systems in terms of both task performance and subjective workload and motion sickness evaluations. It inspires new control and feedback designs for the future snake robot in industrial operations.",

The main obstacle to the adoption of fully automatic methods is the requirement for the highest possible deforestation detection accuracy, which arises from the official nature of the deforestation reports, used as a basis for deforestation prevention policies and international treaties. This work addresses such a high accuracy constraint by introducing a semi-automatic method that aims at limiting visual analysis to areas where automatic classification is characterized by high uncertainty. We hypothesize that classification uncertainty is correlated with classification error. Therefore, by trusting automatic detections with low uncertainty and subjecting areas of high uncertainty to visual audit, the amount of human intervention in the whole process could be limited to a small fraction of the forest area, while very high accuracies would be achieved. In this work we investigate various uncertainty estimation strategies, including multiple and single inference approaches, and evaluate different uncertainty metrics. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify the natural factors and deforestation practices that contribute to high uncertainty in automatic classification. We draw interesting conclusions from the analysis of selected regions of two distinct target sites, which exemplify common causes of uncertainty and indicate how uncertainty may be related with ongoing forest degradation processes. Through experimental evaluation at those sites, we demonstrate that the proposed semi-automatic methodology can achieve impressive accuracies in terms of F1-score values, exceeding 97%, while reducing the total human audit workload to just 3% of the target area.",

The methodological approach includes 1) expert-based methods—specifically, representational analysis (focused on interface elements), keystroke level modeling (KLM), and cognitive walkthrough; and 2) quantitative analysis of interactive behaviors based on video-captured observations. Medication administration record (MAR) tasks completed by nurses during preoperative (PreOp) patient assessment were studied across three Mayo Clinic regional campuses and three different EHR systems. By analyzing the steps executed within the interfaces involved to complete the MAR tasks, we characterized complexities in EHR navigation. These complexities were reflected in time spent on task, click counts, and screen transitions, and were found to potentially influence nurses’ performance. Two of the EHR systems, employing a single screen format, required less time to complete (mean 101.5, range 106–97 s), respectively, compared to one system employing multiple screens (176 s, 73% increase). These complexities surfaced through trade-offs in cognitive processes that could potentially influence nurses’ performance. Factors such as perceptual-motor activity, visual search, and memory load impacted navigational complexity. An implication of this work is that small tractable changes in interface design can substantially improve EHR navigation, overall usability, and workflow.",

The first aim of this research project is to analyze the various work postures associated with manual assembly work, within a plastics manufacturing company. The analysis of these work postures will help in understanding the ergonomic conditions of different workstations within the company. The second aim of this project is to study the OSHA incident reports and determine whether correlation exists between a specific workstation and specific body parts. The ultimate objective of this research is to find solutions and to recommend changes that improve the workstations. One way this can be accomplished is by taking ergonomic measures that can be used to evaluate working postures and physical workloads for manual assembly tasks to prevent ergonomic injuries which may lead to WRMDs. This is expected to result in improved productivity, better product quality, and lower medical costs.",

Traditionally capacity demand at each worksystem is determined from standard operating processes and estimated production flow rates, accounting for a desired level of utilization or required throughput times. However, for distributed production control systems, the flows across multiple possible production paths are not known a priori. In this contribution, we use methods from algorithmic game-theory and traffic-modeling to predict the flows, and hence capacity demand across worksystems, based on the available production paths and desired output rates, assuming non-cooperative agents with global information. We propose an iterative algorithm that converges simultaneously to a feasible capacity distribution and a flow distribution over multiple paths that satisfies Wardrop's first principle. We demonstrate our method on models of real-world production networks.",

Habitual actions are adaptive, learned behaviours that are automated in order to reduce cognitive load and to allow for efficient interaction with the environment. Goal-directed and habitual actions are mediated by distinct neurocircuits which centre on the dorsal striatum and involve different cortical and limbic inputs. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) has yet to be considered in this neurocircuitry despite its anatomical connections with these neurocircuits and its established role in motivated behaviour. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the LH has a role in the development of habitual actions in rats by knocking down protein expression in the LH with short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). Two shRNAs were utilised, both of which were shown to reduce the expression of two neuropeptides within the LH, orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone, compared to a saline-vehicle control. This was unexpected given that one shRNA was a control vector (i.e, scrambled sequence), and the other shRNA was supposed to selectively target orexin’s precursor protein. Given this lack of specificity and that shRNA’s are known to be neurotoxic, the current study examined the impact of non-selective dysfunction of the LH on habitual actions. Adult male Long-Evans rats were trained to press a lever for a food outcome and were tested for goal directed and habitual behaviour following devaluation of the food. The shRNA groups displayed goal-directed actions following moderate instrumental training, but did not develop habitual actions following extended training. That is, control rats developed the expected habitual behaviour where lever-response rates were insensitive to outcome value when tested, whilst the shRNA groups reduced rates of responding on the lever under devalued conditioned and hence remained goal-directed. This failure to demonstrate habitual actions was unlikely to be secondary to changes in motivation or arousal as the shRNA groups did not show altered food consumption, body weight, lever response rates, or motor performance on a rota rod or tapered balance beam. However, locomotor activity was reduced in an open field test, consistent with the proposed role of the LH in spontaneous locomotor activity. Therefore, this study implicates the LH in habitual learning, and adds to the emerging evidence that the LH has a role in associative learning processes. This finding has implications for human conditions where there is dysfunction or neurodegeneration in the LH, as well as altered habitual actions, such as in Parkinson’s disease and drug addiction.",

At the end of the battle with the enemy, many weapons are destroyed. Damaged weapons are classified as complete, medium, or minor destruction. Among them, a minor destruction-weapon can be reused immediately after repair by simply replacing a damaged or lost part. However, it is almost impossible to carry thousands of weapon parts due to the nature of troops that constantly move to different places in the battlefield. In order to improve this situation, it is possible to carry the 3D printer at a specific unit and produce necessary parts in the field to repair the minor destruction-weapon. For this purpose, this study proposes a scheduling model to produce the necessary parts in the shortest time after the end of each battle. The set of 3D printers is a parallel machine and can produce all sorts of parts, and it can have different ability to produce. 3D printers can produce finished product for each part at a time, or can produce two subparts separately for each part, but if they separately manufacture subparts, it increases the workload for that part because of additional production of attachment for assembly. That is, the total production time for that part in the case of manufacturing subparts separately is longer than that in the case of producing the finished product at once. Nevertheless, this study confirms that it is possible to shorten the makespan when planning the production schedule of 3D printer by introducing the subpart-split manufacturing concept for weapon parts.",

This study aimed to analyze the impact of two military boots, standard boot (STD) and minimalist boot (MIN) on slip events, before (PRE) and after (POST) a military type load carrying task. Methods Sixteen male participants (age: 27 ± 3.9 years; height: 178 ± 6.2 cm, mass: 87 ± 12.4 kg) were tested for heel kinematics using motion capture, during unexpected (US) and expected slips (ES) both before and after the task. Slip parameters of heel slip distance (HSD) and mean heel slip velocity (MHSV) were analyzed with a 2 (STD × MIN) × 2 (PRE × POST) × 2 (US × ES) repeated measures ANOVA. Results Significantly greater HSD (p = 0.002) and MHSV (p = 0.001) were demonstrated in STD compared to MIN, regardless of the load carrying workload and the type of slip. No significant interactions between boots, workload and slip type were found. MIN exhibited a greater percent of non-hazardous slips compared to STD. Conclusions Greater HSD and MHSV seen in STD, suggests that MIN performed better under slippery conditions. The military type workload and the type of slip did not appear to influence slip parameters, with boot differences seen as the major influence on these slip outcomes. MIN boot's better performance could be attributed to the minimalist sole, tread and groove pattern, lighter mass and flexible shaft aiding in better maneuvering under slippery conditions. Relevance to industry Slip outcomes in two different military boots, before and after a military type load carrying workload are addressed. The lighter minimalist tactical boot outperformed the standard tactical boot, under slippery conditions. Findings from this study will help offer suggestions for footwear design in the military, especially for maneuvering slippery environment.",

Single board computer (SBC) clusters, predominantly adopting Raspberry Pi (RPi), have been employed to explore the potential of MapReduce processing in terms of low power and cost because, capital costs aside, power consumption has also become a primary concern in many industries. After building SBC clusters, it is prevalent to consider adding more nodes, particularly newer generation SBCs, to the existing clusters or replacing old (or inactive) nodes with new ones to improve performance, inevitably causing heterogeneous SBC clusters. The Hadoop framework on these heterogeneous SBC clusters creates challenging new problems due to computing resource discrepancies in each node. Native Hadoop does not carefully consider the heterogeneity of the cluster nodes. Consequently, heterogeneous SBC Hadoop clusters result in significant performance variation or, more critically, persistent node failures. This paper proposes a new Hadoop Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) architecture design to improve MapReduce performance on heterogeneous SBC Hadoop clusters with tight computing resources. We newly implement two main scheduling policies on Hadoop YARN based on the correct computing resource information that each SBC node provides: (1) two (master-driven vs. slave-driven) MapReduce task scheduling frameworks to determine more effective processing modes and (2) ApplicationMaster (AM) and reduce task distribution mechanisms to provide the best Hadoop performance by minimizing performance variation. Thus, the proposed Hadoop framework makes the best use of the performance-frugal SBC Hadoop cluster by intelligently distributing MapReduce tasks to each node. To our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first redesigned Hadoop YARN architecture to address various challenging problems particularly on heterogeneous SBC Hadoop clusters for big data processing. The extensive experiments with Hadoop benchmarks demonstrate that the redesigned framework performs better performance than the native Hadoop by an average of 2.55× and 1.55× under I/O intensive and CPU-intensive workloads, respectively.",

In road traffic, cooperation means that drivers (cooperation partners) coordinate their driving behaviour in a way that they facilitate each other’s intended driving manoeuvres. An experimental study was conducted with 30 participants in a static high-end simulator. The test scenarios included merging onto a motorway and turning left at a rural intersection. As independent variables, the HMI (Baseline vs. Sensor vs. C2X (Car-to-everything)) was varied in addition to the cooperation situation (merging vs. turning left). All HMI variants were based on a HUD (Head-Up Display). In the Baseline condition, the HMI only showed information about speed and navigation. The Sensor HMI visualised additionally the driving situation as it can be detected by the vehicle's own sensors. The C2X HMI was based on C2X communication and also represented the different phases of manoeuvre coordination with the cooperation partner. The traffic flow and the behaviour of the surrounding traffic did not differ between the different HMI variants, in order to ensure that the traffic situation did not influence the participants’ evaluation of the HMI variants. The dependent variables included subjective (e.g. acceptance, usability) and objective measures (e.g. driving and gaze behaviour). The results showed that a system supporting cooperative interactions is generally accepted by drivers. The most preferred system was the C2X HMI. The advantages of a C2X based HMI were an improved user experience leading to a greater intent to use the ADAS for cooperative driving interactions, increased system trust, and an easier handling of the system. The workload of the C2X HMI did not exceed the level reported for the Baseline or the Sensor HMI – although the C2X HMI presented more information. The results are used to derive indications for the design of assistance systems supporting cooperative driving behaviour.",

A breach of these SLAs results in a heavy economic loss for the service provider. We study a queueing model of data backup systems with a focus on the age of data. The age of data is roughly defined as the time for which data has not been backed up and is therefore a measure of uncertainty for the user.

It is critical to ensure that the tail probabilities are small so that the system stays within SLAs with a high probability. Therefore, we also analyze the tail distribution of the age of data by performing dominant singularity analysis of its generating function.

Two such measures, surprisal and next-word entropy, suffer from shortcomings when employed for a predictive processing view.

Subsequently, we put them to the test by analysing how well the estimated measures predict human processing effort in three data sets of naturalistic sentence reading. Our results replicate the well known effect of surprisal on word reading effort, but do not indicate a role of next-word entropy or lookahead information gain. Our computational results suggest that, in a predictive processing system, the costs of predicting may outweigh the gains. This idea poses a potential limit to the value of a predictive mechanism for the processing of language. The result illustrates the unresolved problem of finding estimations of word-by-word prediction that, first, are truly independent of perceptual processing of the to-be-predicted words, second, are statistically reliable predictors of experimental data, and third, can be derived from more general assumptions about the cognitive processes involved.",

The intensive manual effort needed makes this process time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated compliance checking (ACC) could be a promising upgrade of the traditional manual code compliance checking. With a reduced workload on design reviewers, ACC is cheaper, faster, and immune to human errors. To support ACC, building code requirements need to be represented in a computer-processable format to enable automated reasoning, which will in turn allow an automated assessment of the building design's compliance status with building codes. A major limitation of many existing ACC systems/methods is their limited range of checkable building code requirements. To address that, the state of the art uses pattern matching-based rules to transform building code requirements into computable formats automatically, but the ruleset was developed and tested only on a few chapters of building code requirements. An efficient ruleset expansion method is needed to increase its range of checkable building code requirements at a low cost, to bring ACC systems closer to full deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a new regulatory information transformation ruleset expansion method for expanding an existing ruleset. This method can expand the range of checkable code requirements of ACC systems without significant manual effort. The proposed ruleset expansion method takes an iterative approach to ensure the generality and validity of new pattern matching-based rules and the quality of information transformation results. The expanded ruleset was tested on generating logic clauses from Chapter 5 of the International Building Code 2015.

Traditional power management techniques, though efficient, is not designed to handle such unseen scenarios. Furthermore, the variation in performance requirements is one of the challenges faced in the era of machine learning. We propose a self-aware power management scheme for multi-core microprocessors in this work to address the above-mentioned issues. We perform application-level power management in this work to overcome the overheads imposed by core-level power management and system-level power management inefficiency. The power management unit employs a linear predictor for workload prediction to perform DVFS. On top of the power manager, the self-aware controller is hierarchically placed to monitor the system components’ health and adapt the power manager's decision to meet the performance requirements and handle changes in system components’ health. We evaluate the proposed self-aware power manager under externally provided high performance goals, and resource contention. A power saving of up to 16% compared to existing power management techniques, and 2.4× speedup with 25% additional power to satisfy high performance compared to power management without self-awareness for a microprocessor with up to 32-cores is achieved.",

In order to realize such a process, it is necessary to bring together the manufacturing, function-simulating and logistics-oriented disciplines in an integrated system. For this, data management along the process chain is an important success factor. In particular, the provision and linking of the data and data formats required for simulation and the production environment is of fundamental importance. This paper presents a data architecture that can serve as a framework for data integration within a representative process chain for regeneration.",

Temporal property graphs are a recent variant where time is a first-class entity to be queried over, and their properties and structure vary over time. These are seen in social, telecom, transit and epidemic networks. However, current graph databases and query engines have limited support for temporal relations among graph entities, no support for time-varying entities and/or do not scale on distributed resources. We address this gap by extending a linear path query model over property graphs to include intuitive temporal predicates and aggregation operators over temporal graphs. We design a distributed execution model for these temporal path queries using the interval-centric computing model, and develop a novel cost model to select an efficient execution plan from several. We perform detailed experiments of our Granite distributed query engine using both static and dynamic temporal property graphs as large as 52M vertices, 218M edges and 325M properties, and a 1600-query workload, derived from the LDBC benchmark. We frequently offer sub-second query latencies on a commodity cluster, which is 149×–1140× faster compared to industry-leading Neo4J shared-memory graph database and the JanusGraph/Spark distributed graph query engine. Granite also completes 100% of the queries for all graphs, compared to only 32–92% workload completion by the baseline systems. Further, our cost model selects a query plan that is within 10% of the optimal execution time in 90% of the cases. Despite the irregular nature of graph processing, we exhibit a weak-scaling efficiency of ≥60% on 8 nodes and ≥40% on 16 nodes, for most query workloads.",

This dual task was used to investigate the effects of workload and resource competition in distinct parts of the dual-task process. The results demonstrated that increasing the tracking speed adversely affected the tracking performance but led to positive arousal to the secondary discrete response task. Visual spatial signals gave the shortest reaction time due to the optimal time-sharing of the visual resources in the focal and ambient channels. Compared with visual spatial signals, spatial signals of auditory and tactile modalities did not lead to an improved performance because of their cross-modality nature. These findings provided practical design guidelines for dual tasks in which the operators need to complete a continuous monitoring task visually and elicit timely and accurate responses to spatial information.",

In line with this, a team-based approach is generally adopted for task assignment to workers in construction operations. However, this approach tends to disregard the differences between skill level, experience, capabilities, learning rates and fatigue rates of different individual workers forming the team. In particular, due to differences in visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor capabilities of different workers and brain resource demands of different activities, the traditional approach may result in inconsistent workloads and uneven fatigue rates within a crew, affecting the workers' and crew's safety negatively. This paper proposes a novel framework for task assignment to construction workers in which safety of individual workers and thus the crew is ensured through optimizing workload distributions within a crew. The framework computes visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor requirements of the jobs assigned to a worker and minimizes the identified workload imbalances through collaborative execution of shared tasks. The application of the proposed framework is examined on a pipe spool fabrication operation of a refinery project in a simulation environment.",

In this paper, we focused on the supervision interfaces used in engine room of Merchant Navy vessels. There is no regulation about color use on these interfaces, despite the color code playing an important role in showing information. The ISO Standard 14726-2008 regulates the color code printed on physical pipes and is used to represent the fluids flowing through it. The purpose of this study is to determine if we could use this standardized color code on the interfaces and create a connection between the physical pipes and their graphical representation. Two experimentations are presented, in which we compared the effects of two color codes on the performance at searching tasks carried out by novices and experts. One code is extracted from ISO Standard 14726-2008 (Normative Pipe Identification Color Code), and the other is created by taking into account general guidelines and common uses (Ergonomic Recommendations Color Code). The results showed that the NPICC, and its bicolor version in particular, increased the mental workload and the searching time required by novices. Experts had more difficulties to recognize the fluids represented by two colors and they used the two-colored fluid system less frequently than novices to retrieve an information.",

The system is capable of performing most of the tasks in an autonomous and intelligent manner, which minimizes the workload of medical staffs, and consequently minimizes the associated psychological stress and improves the quality of patient care as well as the system performance. We show how the different actors in the e-Healthcare society can interact with each other in a secure manner. To ensure data privacy, the mechanism involves intelligent authentication based on random distributive key management, electronic certificate distribution, and modified realm Kerberos. The system handles dynamic assignments of doctors to specific patients. It also addresses the need for patients to share their health information with strangers while dealing with the privacy preservation issue.

One interesting approach to accelerate the picking process is to separate the warehouse into forward and reserve areas, where the forward area holds a limited amount of inventory for fast picking that is replenished by the stock in the reserve area. To date, the replenishment operation is often conducted manually or using goods-to-person technologies such as automated storage/retrieval systems. Recently, a newly developed market-ready technology called picking robots, which are a kind of autonomous mobile robots, was implemented in e-commerce warehouses. They can be integrated into existing manual order picking systems without modifying the warehouse layout. In this study, we simulate a case wherein picking robots are applied for replenishment tasks to avoid stock shortages in fast-picking areas, thereby supporting the picking activities of humans. The aim is to reduce the human workload during the order picking process. We investigate various scenarios with different human–robot team configurations and demand patterns. The results indicate that such a setting can improve working conditions by simultaneously reducing human energy expenditure and costs per pick. The contribution of this study is to introduce these robots to forward–reserve warehouses, obtain preliminary results regarding system performance, and discuss related opportunities for future work.",2

However, both rely on human experience, often leading to ineffective planning. This study describes the use of cloud computing together with mobile devices for planning the optimal size and mix of nursing teams and scheduling in nursing homes. In the context of residential care, cloud computing can make the determination and planning of nursing staff demand more efficient and cost effective, while mobile devices can facilitate easy and rapid dissemination of planning information. This study applies nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II in cloud computing to solve the integrated nursing staff demand modelling and scheduling problem. A case study of a subvented nursing home in Hong Kong was conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and framework. Results show that the total overtime work (in hours) was minimised, while the nurse-to-resident ratios were significantly improved. The model permits an analysis of the impact of digital technologies on healthcare at the strategic level. Further, results suggest that it is cost beneficial to introduce digitalisation to integrated nursing staff demand modelling and scheduling problems in nursing homes.",

Instead of focusing on the development of new resource-managing models as soon as new workloads and patterns appear, we propose DISCERNER, a decision-theory model that can learn from numerous data-centre execution logs to determine which existing resource-managing model may optimise the overall performance for a given time period. Such a decision-theory system employs a classic machine-learning classifier to make real-time decisions based on past execution logs and on the current data-centre operational situation. A set of extensive and industry-guided experiments has been simulated by a validated data-centre simulation tool. The results obtained show that the values of key performance indicators may be improved by at least 20% in realistic scenarios.",

However, recent studies have addressed possible drawbacks in the acute phase after stroke onset. We investigated these critical assumptions in a large and homogeneous sample of 180 acute stroke patients. Line bisection, cancellation performance, copying, and primary visual field defects were assessed in 180 acute right-hemispheric stroke patients. Effects of visual field defects and concurrent spatial neglect on line bisection were analyzed by multiple regression to account for possible additive and interactive effects. The relation between line bisection and other tests applied in spatial neglect was explored by factorial analysis. We found no evidence for the existence of a contralesional ‘hemianopic line bisection error’ in acute patients with primary visual field defects. Such patients even showed a more pronounced ipsilesional line bisection error. Second, the factorial analysis revealed that the line bisection task on the one hand and cancellation/copying tasks on the other were represented by different factors, indicating that they make different cognitive demands. In the acute phase of stroke, line bisection does not appear to be a valid task to diagnose neither primary visual field defects nor spatial neglect (the latter as defined by its core symptoms (cf., Karnath and Rorden, 2012) which are typically captured with cancellation/copying tasks).",

A recent study Greene et al. (2018) predicted the fluid intelligence scores using FCs derived from rest and multiple task conditions, suggesting that task-induced brain state manipulation improved prediction of individual traits. Here, using a large dataset incorporating fMRI data from rest and 7 distinct task conditions, we replicated the original study by employing a different machine learning approach, and applying the method to predict two reading comprehension-related cognitive measures. Consistent with their findings, we found that task-based machine learning models often outperformed rest-based models. We also observed that combining multi-task fMRI improved prediction performance, yet, integrating the more fMRI conditions can not necessarily ensure better predictions. Compared with rest, the predictive FCs derived from language and working memory tasks were highlighted with more predictive power in predominantly default mode and frontoparietal networks. Moreover, prediction models demonstrated high stability to be generalizable across distinct cognitive states. Together, this replication study highlights the benefit of using task-based FCs to reveal brain-behavior relationships, which may confer more predictive power and promote the detection of individual differences of connectivity patterns underlying relevant cognitive traits, providing strong evidence for the validity and robustness of the original findings.",

The loss of material in these components and changes in their cross-section geometry significantly impact the stability and load-bearing capacity of historic buildings. A portable LiDAR device is utilized to acquire the cross-section geometry of the deteriorated components. The irregular cross-section profiles are extracted using point cloud slicing and the Alpha-Shape algorithm. Geometric characteristics such as cross-section area, moment of inertia, and moment of resistance are calculated using Green's integral method. The performance of this method is evaluated by measuring eight groups of deteriorated components with different cross-section characteristics and comparing it with five traditional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the calculation accuracy by 1%–21% relative to traditional methods, thereby enhancing reliability by 9%–54%. Additionally, it reduces manual calculation workload and human error, while promoting calculation efficiency. The method exhibits excellent applicability and high efficiency, with an error below 3% when compared to the true value. This method proves valuable in evaluating the extent of deterioration in historic timber components and provides essential data for preventive conservation and restoration of historic timber buildings.",

However, manual image analysis of cardiac substructures is resource-intensive and error-prone. While automated methods exist for clinical CT images, translating these to preclinical μCT data is challenging. We employed deep learning to automate the extraction of quantitative data from both CT and μCT images. Methods We collected a public dataset of cardiac CT images of human patients, as well as acquired μCT images of wild-type and accelerated aging mice. The left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle were manually segmented in the μCT training set. After template-based heart detection, two separate segmentation neural networks were trained using the nnU-Net framework. Results The mean Dice score of the CT segmentation results (0.925 ± 0.019, n = 40) was superior to those achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms. Automated and manual segmentations of the μCT training set were nearly identical. The estimated median Dice score (0.940) of the test set results was comparable to existing methods. The automated volume metrics were similar to manual expert observations. In aging mice, ejection fractions had significantly decreased, and myocardial volume increased by age 24 weeks. Conclusions With further optimization, automated data extraction expands the application of (μ)CT imaging, while reducing subjectivity and workload. The proposed method efficiently measures the left and right ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial mass. With uniform translation between image types, cardiac functioning in diastolic and systolic phases can be monitored in both animals and humans.",

In a move to green transportation, the traditional diesel powered cranes are being converted to electric ones. In this paper, we study the deployment of electric powered gantry cranes (ERTGs) in container terminal yards. Cranes always move in-between blocks to serve different workload. ERTGs use electricity for most movements but switch to diesel engines to allow inter-block transfers between unaligned blocks. We exploit this feature and propose to consider simultaneously the CO2 emissions and workload delays to develop carbon-efficient deployment strategies. Moreover, unlike previous works we consider the workload uncertainty, and model the problem as a two-stage stochastic program. A sample average approximation framework with Benders decomposition is employed to solve the problem. Multiple acceleration techniques are proposed, including a tailored regularised decomposition approach and valid inequalities. A case study with sample data from a major port in East China show that our proposal could reduce significantly CO2 emissions with only a marginal compromise in workload delays.

Designers need to evaluate users’ performance and workload while using a system and compare different design options to determine the optimal design choice. Currently, human factors evaluation and tests mainly rely on empirical user studies, which add a heavy cost to the design process. In addition, it is difficult to conduct comprehensive user tests at early design stages when no physical interfaces have been implemented. To address these issues, I develop computational human performance modeling techniques that can simulate users’ interaction with machine systems. This method uses a general cognitive architecture to computationally represent human cognitive capabilities and constraints. Task-specific models can be built with the specifications of user knowledge, user strategies, and user group differences. The simulation results include performance measures such as task completion time and error rate as well as workload measures. Completed studies have modeled multitasking scenarios in a wide range of domains, including transportation, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. The success of these studies demonstrated the modeling capabilities of this method. Cognitive-architecture-based models are useful, but building a cognitive model itself can be difficult to learn and master. It usually requires at least medium-level programming skills to understand and use the language and syntaxes that specify the task. For example, to build a model that simulates a driving task, a modeler needs to build a driving simulation environment so that the model can interact with the simulated vehicle. In order to simply this process, I have conducted preliminary programming work that directly connects the mental model to existing task environment simulation programs. The model will be able to directly obtain perceptual information from the task program and send control commands to the task program. With cognitive model-based tools, designers will be able to see the model performing the tasks in real-time and obtain a report of the evaluation. Automated human factors evaluation methods have tremendous value to support systems design and evaluation.",

To match this emerging interest, social psychology is embracing new methodological approaches. We identify eye-tracking as an unobtrusive, direct and fine-grained process tracing technique with promising implications for these new developments. In particular, eye-tracking helps researchers avoid relying on self-report measures alone and otherwise necessary interruptions of the processes they aim to observe and understand. In order to enable social psychologists to effectively use eye-tracking, we provide a systematic review of commonly used measures. Following an introduction of the basic principles and assumptions underlying the use of eye-tracking generally, we review eye-tracking measures addressing concepts of interest for many core theories of social psychology. Specifically, we introduce options to measure processing depth and decision effort, information weighting, search strategies, cognitive load and arousal. We showcase potential uses in exemplary research questions, providing a starting point for how to select appropriate measures and tailor designs to future applications of eye-tracking to social psychology. Further, we critically discuss the limitations and auxiliary assumptions on which the introduced measures are based. Finally, we illustrate the use of eye-tracking with examples from contemporary psychological research with relevance for social psychology, and conclude with an outlook for potential benefits of the use of eye-tracking methods in core topics of social psychology.",

In contrast to previous literature, both demand and production are stochastic. We develop a novel bid-price-based revenue management approach to solve this decision problem. The production system is modeled using clearing functions to capture the non-linear inter-dependency of workload and lead times in stochastic production systems. In extant literature, a common approach to cope with variability in a production system is to introduce fixed, workload-independent lead times. We show in a numerical study that our newly developed approach based on clearing functions clearly outperforms this fixed lead time approach.",1

Unmanned ground vehicles for rescue, also known as search and rescue robots, serve as extensions of responders in a disaster, providing real-time video and other relevant information about the situation. However, physically separating responder and robot introduces latency between the human input provided to the unmanned vehicle to execute an operation and the subsequent response provided by the system. This latency (lag or time delay) is determined by the distance and the bandwidth of the connection between the operator and the unmanned vehicle. Automating these systems may mitigate the effect of latency to an extent; however, this has its own consequences, such as leaving the responder out of the loop, which subsequently leads to detrimental effects on situational awareness. This research investigates the relationship between latency and the performance of the human operator of a teleoperated robot at different levels of system complexity and the effect of different levels of automation on this relationship. Eighty participants operated one or two unmanned teleoperated robots to complete two search and rescue tasks. The study utilized a 2 × 2 × 2 mixed-subjects experimental design with the automation level and latency level being the between-subjects factors and the system complexity (controlling one or two robots) being the within-subjects factor. The dependent variables were operator performance, perceived workload, and the subjective rating of trust with automation. A latency of 500 ms showed a significant decrease in performance in time to complete the task and a significant increase in the perceived physical workload. Both the automation level and latency level moderated the system complexity effect on the subjective rating of trust in the robotic system. The level of trust decreased over time in the one-robot condition as opposed to no change in the two-robot condition. The error rate decreased over time at different rates based on the number of robots or the latency level. Based on the results of the study, several design implications are suggested for improving performance including adding features to the automation that will allow the operator to use common strategies and providing necessary information using multiple sensory channels. Future research directions are also proposed.",

The difficulty of acquiring such annotation limits the application and popularization of the DCNN-based approaches. To address the issue, a weakly supervised approach is proposed in the paper which performs instance segmentation only with the supervision of bounding box or coarse localization annotation. A novel DCNN model is constructed which consists of two branches: the centerness branch and the segmentation branch. The former branch is to learn the semantically spatial importance over the areas of object instances under the localization supervision. Object proposals with exact boundaries are automatically generated and are then ranked under the guidance of the output of the centerness branch. The most matched instance proposal is assigned to each object, which is then used to supervise the segmentation branch. The losses are calculated by both the outputs of the two branches and the entire DCNN model is trained end-to-end. Experiments are extensively conducted to verify the effectiveness. With the supervision of precise bounding box annotation, our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in the comparison with recent related works. And in the case of coarse localization annotation, our approach only deduces a slight reduction in accuracy, which significantly outperforms other approaches. The excellent performance demonstrates that our approach would be helpful to further alleviate the workload of image annotation while maintaining competitive accuracy.",

There are multiple categories and types of WL measures, but not all meet the criteria for useful measures. It is not uncommon to find that multiple WL measures for the same task do not concur, which raises questions about whether there should be specific WL measures for certain tasks, and if so, how that should be determined. The present experiment investigated the sensitivity of various physiological and self-report measures in detecting changes in WL elicited by different levels of task demands in two tasks. Each participant was asked to assume the role of a Soldier in a human-robot team performing a simulated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The mission entailed performing a change detection task and a peripheral task of maintaining awareness of the robot teammate's location and surroundings. Auditory prompts were presented to probe the participant's situation awareness of the robot, with regard to its direction of travel and features of its surroundings. Physiological devices used to assess WL were the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), transcranial Doppler (TCD), functional Near-Infrared (fNIR), and eye tracker. Self-report measures included the TLX and DSSQ. Findings from the present experiment inform developers of unmanned systems about the sensitivity of various WL measures in assessing levels of mental demands imposed by working with unmanned systems.",

However, the excessive use of such assistance systems might reduce the chances of developing drivers’ skill. Haptic-shared and cooperative controls are methods in which the automated system shares a single operation with human operators and provides partial assistance, respectively. Effective collaboration between a human operator and an automated system can be achieved by the tuning controller, which is introduced to facilitate the improvement of human operators’ skills. We discuss a methodology to decrease drivers’ workload and improve their driving skills by using haptic shared and cooperative control methods. Backward parking assist by haptic shared control is presented to increase performance during assistance and skill improvement after assistance.",19

An emerging approach has examined within-person neural differentiation using moment-to-moment brain signal variability. A number of studies have found that brain signal variability differs by cognitive state; however, the factors that cause signal variability to rise or fall on a given task remain understudied. We hypothesized that top performers would modulate signal variability according to the complexity of sensory input, upregulating variability when processing more feature-rich stimuli. In the current study, 46 older adults passively viewed face and house stimuli during fMRI. Low-level analyses showed that house images were more feature-rich than faces, and subsequent computational modelling of ventral visual stream responses (HMAX) revealed that houses were more feature-rich especially in V1/V2-like model layers. Notably, we then found that participants exhibiting greater face-to-house upregulation of brain signal variability in V1/V2 (higher for house relative to face stimuli) also exhibited more accurate, faster, and more consistent behavioral performance on a battery of offline visuo-cognitive tasks. Further, control models revealed that face-house modulation of mean brain signal was relatively insensitive to offline cognition, providing further evidence for the importance of brain signal variability for understanding human behavior. We conclude that the ability to align brain signal variability to the richness of perceptual input may mark heightened trait-level behavioral performance in older adults.",

This study investigates the relationship between these measures under increasing cognitive loads. Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill at 1 m/s under walk only and two dual-task conditions. The secondary tasks were visuomotor cognitive games (VCG) of increasing difficulty level. The center of pressure displacement in the mediolateral direction (ML COP-D) and cognitive game performance were recorded for analysis. The following measures were calculated: (1) sample entropy (SampEn) and quantized dynamical entropy (QDE) of the ML COP-D, (2) short-term largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) of the ML COP-D, and (3) variability of inter-stride spatio-temporal gait variables. Entropy and variability measures significantly increased from walk only to both dual-task conditions. Whereas, the short-term LLE increased only during the easy VCG task. No measure was sensitive to the difficulty level of the VCG tasks. The variability of heel strike positions in the mediolateral direction was positively correlated with SampEn and QDE. However, there were no significant correlations between the short-term LLE and either variability measures or entropy measures. These findings confirm that each of these measures is representative of a different aspect of human gait dynamics.",

This paper presents an approach based on generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPN) for performance and energy consumption evaluation of individual and hybrid storage systems.

The results show significant differences in pilots’ percentage of fixation between two interface designs on the ICP (t=-3.36, p<.005, Cohen's d=-.98); RMFD (t=-4.85, p<.001, Cohen's d=-1.55) and LMFD (t=-2.56, p<.05, Cohen's d=-.79).

By the application of eye tracker devices, interface designers can precisely evaluate pilots’ visual behavior among interfaces of cockpit and SA performance. In addition, extra workload might have a negative impact on pilots’ SA performance and increase the probability of operating hazards, and so there is the opportunity to compensate for the negative impact of workload through human-centered design. The current research uses eye-tracking devices to investigate pilots’ visual behaviors and interface design and has potential to facilitate system designers’ understanding of pilots’ attention distribution and situational awareness for improving the integration of cockpit designs and ultimately aviation safety.",

Whereas most overimitation research has focused on social factors associated with overimitation, comparatively little is known about the cognitive- and task-specific features that influence overimitation. Specifically, developmental contrasts between imitation and overimitation are confounded by the addition of irrelevant actions to causally necessary actions, increasing sequence length, cognitive load, and processing costs—variables known to be age dependent. We constructed a novel puzzle box task such that a four-step imitation, four-step overimitation, and two-step efficient sequence could be demonstrated using the same apparatus on video. In Experiments 1 and 2, 2.5- to 5-year-olds randomly assigned to imitation and overimitation groups performed significantly more target actions than baseline control groups. Rates of imitation and overimitation increased as a function of age, with older preschoolers outperforming younger preschoolers in both conditions. In Experiment 3, preschoolers were shown a video of an efficient two-step demonstration prior to testing. After they responded, they were shown a four-step overimitation video and were tested on the same puzzle box. Children imitated the efficient demonstration, but after watching the overimitation video, they also overimitated the irrelevant actions. Once again, older children overimitated more than younger children. Together, results show that preschoolers are faithful, flexible, and persistent overimitators. The fidelity and flexibility of overimitation are constrained not only by social factors but also by basic cognitive processes that vary across age groups. As these constraints diminish, overimitation and flexible (optimal) imitation increases.",

Participants concurrently performed a manual tracking task with two levels of difficulty and a system monitoring task assisted by an unreliable signaling system. Eye movement data indicate that operators allocate less visual attention to monitor automation when the tracking task is more difficult. Participants reported reduced levels of trust toward the signaling system when the tracking task demanded more focused visual attention. Analyses revealed that trust mediated the relationship between the load of the tracking task and attention allocation in Experiment 1, an effect that was not replicated in Experiment 2. Results imply a complex process underlying task load, visual attention allocation, and automation trust during multitasking. Automation designers should consider operators’ task load in multitasking workspaces to avoid reduced automation monitoring and distrust toward imperfect signaling systems.",

We start by having expert radiologists manually annotate 22 anatomical structures in 5,246 CT volumes. Following this, a semi-automatic annotation procedure is performed for the remaining CT volumes, where radiologists revise the annotations predicted by AI, and in turn, AI improves its predictions by learning from revised annotations. Such a large-scale, detailed-annotated, and multi-center dataset is needed for two reasons. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas provides important resources for AI development at scale, branded as large pre-trained models, which can alleviate the annotation workload of expert radiologists to transfer to broader clinical applications. Secondly, AbdomenAtlas establishes a large-scale benchmark for evaluating AI algorithms—the more data we use to test the algorithms, the better we can guarantee reliable performance in complex clinical scenarios.

We further look into the challenges in ASPR with the existing technologies. The major difficulties lie in inadequate data, imperfect document parsing and representation, defective human–computer interaction, and flawed deep logical reasoning. Moreover, we point out the future directions and discuss the possible moral and ethical issues of ASPR. In the foreseeable future, ASPR and peer review will coexist in a reinforcing manner before ASPR is able to fully undertake the reviewing workload from humans.",

However, these methods ignore interaction effects of body segments. This may lead to inaccurate assessment of risk scores of workload. The aim of the study was to examine interaction effects of shoulder flexion angle and back angle on rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and muscle activity, and to investigate the correlation between corresponding Ovako Working Posture Analysing System (OWAS) risk scores on the one hand and RPE and muscle activity on the other. The study revealed that there is a significant interaction effect of back angle and shoulder angle on muscle activity and RPE. Furthermore, OWAS seems to correlate only with back muscle activity. Thus, integration of interaction effects to ergonomic assessment methods seems to provide a higher accuracy of risk scores. Relevance to industry This article introduces the relevance of interaction effects of body segments to the assessment of workload. The study revealed that isolated assessment of working postures ignores interaction effects. A consideration of interaction effects leads to a higher accuracy of risk scores quantifying exposure to workload.",

In this study, ten logistic workers underwent a 5-week progressive familiarization to a passive shoulder exoskeleton, while ten workers acted as controls. Tests pre and post the familiarization applied measurements of muscle activity and kinematics of back, neck, and shoulder, perceived effort, and usability-ratings of the exoskeleton. Exoskeleton use resulted in lower muscle activity of anterior deltoid (13–39%) and upper trapezius (16–60%) and reduced perceived effort. Additionally, it induced an offset in shoulder flexion and abduction during resting position (8–10°). No conclusions on familiarization could be drawn due to low adherence to the protocol. However, the emotions of the workers towards using the exoskeleton decreased making it questionable whether the shoulder exoskeleton is suitable for use in the logistics sector.",

The thermal scattering theory is introduced to pre-define the initial topology of the thermal invisible cloak as two layers to reduce the number of design variables. In bilayer concentric rings, insulating and high thermal conductivity materials are used to mask heat flow and correct thermal properties. Topology optimization based on the CMA-ES strategy is applied to quickly obtain the best configuration of available materials. The influence of the thermal properties of the material on the optimal configuration and the deflection angle of the thermal flux at the boundary surface has been investigated. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the function of the optimal cloak with that of the ideal metamaterial and the single insulating layer. The results show that despite its simple structure, the bilayer scattering cloak exhibits excellent cloaking performance under different thermal boundary conditions. In this work, the perfect scattering elimination is achieved by adjusting the layer thickness ratio of the cloak with the initial defined structure rather than seeking the optimal thermal conductivity of material, so as to avoid the problem of mismatch between the actual and ideal parameters. Compared to continuous optimization method, the pre-defined bilayer structure is easy to manufacture. Our scheme introduces thermal scattering theory to pre-set the initial structure of the topology optimization method, which provides a general, convenient, and efficient means for the design and application of thermally functional materials.",

The AFF guides the user to certain reference paths enabling the user to keep the desired position and orientation of the end effector. The reference paths are computed using learning data of experienced users. The AFF is realized by an impedance control of the robot. The main focus of this paper is to investigate how the AFF improves the handling of the robot. For this a user study has been performed with 42 participants. The experiments were complemented by questionnaires regarding user comfort and task workload. The results of the study show an obvious improvement on the performance and the ergonomic quantities applying the AFF.,32

Since user experience means holistic feelings caused by attributes like efficiency, effectiveness, pleasure, and attractiveness, it is necessary to evaluate user experience in many respects, including presence, usability, and workload. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the UX of VR in four various metrics: presence, workload, usability, and flow. In this study, the user experience factor was confirmed through the previous studies comparing visual display terminals (VDT) and head-mounted displays (HMD). In addition, the UX difference between VDT and HMD in two different situations, walking and driving, is analyzed. The data of 26 participants were analyzed and found that there were significant differences in the four studied metrics related to UX. In the driving situation, the usability value was higher in VDT, whereas they were higher in HMD for walking. Comparing the two contexts in HMD, walking was significantly higher in three metrics: presence, usability, and flow. The results show that HMD is better in terms of user experience than VDT, and HMD is more suitable for walking situations than for driving situations. Through this study, in terms of user experience, it is suitable to replace walking tasks with VR when the experiment in a real-world environment is impossible.",

Pressure sensors, known for their low power consumption and strong resistance to interference, are suitable for blink detection. Existing research has predominantly focused on sensor materials and signal processing, and studies on the characteristics and optimized design of voluntary blink actions in ECHCI remain relatively limited. Therefore, this study presents a blink detection system based on pressure sensors and investigates the efficiency of voluntary blink actions. We examined the effects of two independent variables, blink count (single, double, and triple) and blink side (bilateral and unilateral), on recognition accuracy and three time-related variables. Subsequently, the subjective workload and evaluation experiments were conducted for each blink action. The results indicate that the blink count has a more pronounced impact on interaction efficiency and comfort, with continuous blink actions exceeding three blinks not being recommended. Bilateral blinks were perceived as more natural and comfortable than unilateral blinks. Moreover, we discovered that the participants exhibited greater attentiveness and focus when performing double bilateral blink actions, making it suitable for important commands. Based on the experimental results, the top three recommended voluntary blink actions are single bilateral blink (SB), double bilateral blink (DB), and single unilateral blink (SU). Finally, a test involving controlling the movement of a toy car using the recommended blink actions validates the usability of the actions and detection system. These findings provide valuable guidance for the design and optimization of voluntary-blink interaction systems, further enhancing this interaction method’s feasibility.",

Currently, research on upper-limb injuries affecting manufacturing workers focusses on the effect of different working conditions on specific muscle fatigue. However, research on the fatigue transformation relationship among various muscles in the process of working is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the fatigue changes between the upper-limb muscles during rotary handing. In this study, 13 male subjects were studied to simulate rotating handling during the manual handling process using surface electromyography (sEMG). Handling angles of 90°, 45°, and 0° were arranged as single variables to conduct the single-factor experiment. The sEMG of the brachioradialis, biceps brachii, trapezius, and multifidus muscle was measured during the operation. The results of this study indicate that the characteristics of muscle fatigue are different at different rotation angles: the multifidus muscle and trapezius were fatigued when the rotation was 90°. Under the condition of a 45° rotation, the activities of the four muscles fluctuated significantly. The slope of the median frequency of the muscles was positive, the load of the four muscles was evenly distributed, and no local fatigue was observed. Under the condition of a 0° rotation, the sEMG indicated that the brachioradialis muscle was fatigued, while the other three muscles had lower loads.",

In Study 1, we compared participants' ability to manually park a Tesla Model X to their use of the Autopark feature to complete perpendicular and parallel parking maneuvers. We investigated differences in parking success and duration, intervention behavior, self-reported levels of trust in and workload associated with the automation, as well as eye and head movements related to monitoring the automation. We found higher levels of trust in the automated parallel parking maneuvers compared to perpendicular parking. The Tesla’s automated perpendicular parking was found to be less efficient than manually executing this maneuver. Study 2 investigated the frequency with which owners of vehicles with automated parking features used those features and probed why they chose not to use them. Vehicle owners reported low use of any automated parking feature. Owners further reported using their vehicle's autonomous parking features in ways consistent with the empirical findings from Study 1: higher usage rates of autonomous parallel parking. The results from both studies revealed that 1) automated parking is error-prone, 2) drivers nonetheless have calibrated trust in the automated parking system, and 3) the benefits of automated parallel parking surpass those of automated perpendicular parking with the current state of the technology.",

This number is also universal among all mammals independent of animal size maintaining a value of around 0.1. By utilizing a unique in vitro model of human aorta, we tested our hypothesis against a wide range of aortic compliance (pulse wave velocity).

Whilst exchanging information with pilots, controllers must also be alert to visual notifications displayed on the radar screen (e.g., warning which indicates a loss of minimum separation between aircraft). Under the assumption that attentional resources are shared between vision and hearing, the visual interface design may also impact the ability to process these auditory stimuli. Using a simulated ATC task, we compared the behavioral and neural responses to two different visual notification designs—the operational alarm that involves blinking colored “ALRT” displayed around the label of the notified plane (“Color-Blink”), and the more salient alarm involving the same blinking text plus four moving yellow chevrons (“Box-Animation”). Participants performed a concurrent auditory task with the requirement to react to rare pitch tones. P300 from the occurrence of the tones was taken as an indicator of remaining attentional resources. Participants who were presented with the more salient visual design showed better accuracy than the group with the suboptimal operational design. On a physiological level, auditory P300 amplitude in the former group was greater than that observed in the latter group. One potential explanation is that the enhanced visual design freed up attentional resources which, in turn, improved the cerebral processing of the auditory stimuli. These results suggest that P300 amplitude can be used as a valid estimation of the efficiency of interface designs, and of cognitive load more generally.",

One way to achieve this is through external human–machine interfaces (eHMIs) that send visual signals to pedestrians. eHMIs can be either text-based or light-based. However, there has been limited research on the effects of these types of eHMI on human information processing and attention allocation. This study aimed to fill this gap by using a gaze-contingent approach, which blurs the view outside a circular aperture, to test the hypothesis that text-based eHMIs, which require focused or foveal attention, result in longer response times compared to light-based eHMIs, which can be understood using peripheral vision. In this study, 23 participants watched animated video clips of traffic situations involving automated vehicles with either no eHMI, a flashing-light eHMI, or a text-based eHMI. Their eye movements were tracked, and they were asked to press the spacebar when they felt it was safe to cross the road. The results showed faster response times when an eHMI was present, with no significant difference between the two types of eHMIs. Further analysis suggested that the flashing-light eHMI captured attention briefly, while the text-based eHMI held attention for a longer period. When no eHMI was present, participants focused on the approaching vehicle for the longest time. The gaze-contingent window resulted in fewer eye movements and slower response times. In conclusion, the study showed that the gaze-contingent window negatively affected response times and eye movements, emphasizing the importance of considering peripheral vision when designing eHMIs for pedestrian safety.",

In recent times, industry and researchers are focusing to add more cores per chip with increasing integration. The sharp growth in core numbers in System-on-Chip (SoC) raise intense challenges for communication among the cores. The scalability, fault tolerance and higher communication bandwidth features made Network-on-chip (NoC), a popular communication architecture than conventional bus architecture. However, the rapid shrinking of CMOS design margins in deep submicron technology has made aging mechanism such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI), a prime concern in NoC design. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-silicon, NBTI stress aware circuit-to-system level solution for a reliable NoC router. To achieve reliability objective, we develop an NBTI aging-aware timing analysis framework based on the real workload stress. Our proposal is based on findings of most stressed path and cells due to NBTI induced effects. We develop an aging-aware cell library and used the multi Vdd technique to mitigate the NBTI induced delay effects. On the basis of volume of experimental analysis, we observed that 66.67% delay increases due to NBTI induced aging effects with real workload stress for a duration of five years. Our proposed NBTI stress mitigation algorithm and technique could able to reduce aging induced delay effects by 36%, hence enhancing the router performance under stress.",

Through delicately tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is currently the most appealing algorithm to achieve configuration auto-tuning. However, considering the tuning cost constraint in practice, there are three critical limitations preventing conventional BO-based approaches from being directly applied into auto-tuning cluster-based big data frameworks. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient configuration auto-tuning approach named TurBO for big data frameworks based on two enhancements of vanilla BO:1) To reduce the essential iteration times, TurBO integrates a well-designed adaptive pseudo point mechanism with BO; 2) To avoid the time-consuming practical evaluation of sub-optimal configurations as possible, TurBO leverages the proposed CASampling method to intelligently tackle with these sub-optimal configurations based on ensemble learning with historical tuning experiences. To evaluate the performance of TurBO, we conducted a series of experiments on a local Spark cluster with 9 different HiBench benchmark applications. Overall, compared with 3 representative BO-based baseline approaches OpenTuner, Bliss and ResTune, TurBO is able to speedup the tuning procedures respectively by 2.24×, 2.29× and 1.97× on average. Besides, TurBO can always achieve a positive cumulative performance gain under the simulated dynamic workload scenario, which means TurBO is indeed appropriate for workload changes of big data applications.",

Robots can reduce human inspectors' workloads and enhance inspection results' reliability by collecting data and automatically identifying quality defects from the raw data. However, current methods for training DL models rely on centralized strategies that require the aggregation of defect data (e.g., uploading to a cloud server), posing concerns about data privacy and security. Thus, this study proposes a three-fold federated learning (FL) framework for training DL models collaboratively, without the need to share local data among construction robots. The framework is specifically applied to image-based crack segmentation, critical for ensuring infrastructures’ safety and serviceability. A lightweight DL model is developed to enable easy implementation on resource-constrained construction robots and to reduce communication costs during federated training. Experimental results show that the proposed FL method outperforms traditional centralized methods. The critical contribution of this study is the hierarchical FL framework, which enables construction robots to leverage big data in a privacy-preserving manner.",

The absence of language in nonhumans raises questions about the extent to which nonhuman working memory includes similar mechanisms. There is strong evidence for rehearsal-like active maintenance in working memory when monkeys are tested with highly familiar stimuli, but not when tested with novel stimuli, suggesting that working memory depends on the existence of previously encoded representations. This difference in working memory for familiar and novel images may exist because, lacking language, monkeys cannot recode novel stimuli in a way that permits active maintenance in working memory. Alternatively, working memory for novel images may have been present, but behaviorally silent, in earlier studies. In tests with novel images, the high familiarity of to-be-remembered stimuli compared to never-before-seen distractors may be such a strong determinant of recognition performance that evidence of working memory is obscured. In the current study, we developed a technique for attenuating the utility of relative familiarity as a mnemonic signal in recognition tests with novel stimuli. In tests with novel images, we observed impairments of memory by concurrent cognitive load and delay interval that indicate actively maintained working memory. This flexibility in monkey working memory suggests that monkeys may recode unfamiliar stimuli to facilitate working memory and establishes new parallels between verbal human working memory and nonverbal nonhuman primate working memory.",24

The researchers engaged with a panel of Nimitz crewmembers for a discussion of workload, notional schedules, and endurance risk factors. Workload was examined with models that consider the human capacity for sustaining. The investigation found that more attention is paid to physical fatigue, compared to cognitive or mental fatigue. Crewmembers emphasized that crew has a “can do” attitude to combat fatigue; the crew stated that “pride and adrenaline overpower fatigue…plus coffee and Red Bull.” They indicated that this results in good initiative, but at times bad judgment while trying to accomplish the work. The current research posits that fatigue is likely to reduce the ability of crewmembers to tolerate sustained performance and associated increased physiological and cognitive costs. However, the authors also recognize the limits of fatigue science with regard to predicting human capacity in intense operational and combat conditions. There is much anecdotal information to suggest that sailors are managing fatigue despite the predictions of various fatigue models. As a result, we cannot yet predict with certainty when the accumulated workload and fatigue of the individual sailor will be untenable, or identify critical thresholds of degraded cognitive capacity and decision making. Rather than rely solely on fatigue prediction software, it is recommended that potential mitigations are considered that might provide the crew more tools to manage endurance as a fatigue abatement strategy. The development of a crew endurance program to mitigate the risks posed by fatigue and reduced alertness during carrier sortie operations would identify risks relating to fatigue and alertness, and generate solutions to mitigate these risks by controlling exposure to endurance risk factors during normal operations so that the crew will be better prepared to respond to any operational demand.",

This development has a considerable impact on the informal communication between AVs and pedestrians. Informal communication with the driver will become obsolete during the interaction with AVs. Literature suggests that external human machine interfaces (eHMIs) might substitute the communication between drivers and pedestrians. In the study, we additionally test a recently discussed type of communication in terms of artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch motion, as an informal communication cue for AVs. N = 54 participants approached AVs in a virtual inner-city traffic environment. We explored the effect of three communication concepts: an artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch motion, eHMI and the combination of both. Moreover, vehicle types (sports car, limousine, SUV) were varied. A mixed-method approach was applied to investigate the participantś crossing behavior and subjective safety feeling. Furthermore, eye movement parameters were recorded as indicators for mental workload. The results revealed that any communication concept drove beneficial effects on the crossing behavior. The participants crossed the road earlier when an active pitch motion was present, as this was interpreted as a stronger braking. Further, the eHMI and a combination of eHMI and active pitch motion had a positive effect on the crossing behavior. The active pitch motion showed no effect on the subjective safety feeling, while eHMI and the combination enhanced the pedestrianś safety feeling while crossing. The use of communication resulted in less mental workload, as evidenced by eye-tracking parameters. Variations of vehicle types did not result in significant main effects but revealed interactions between parameters. The active pitch motion revealed no learning. In contrast, it took participants several trials for the eHMI and the combination condition to affect their crossing behavior. To sum up, this study indicates that communication between AVs and pedestrians can benefit from the consideration of vehicle motion.",

Majority of IoT applications switched to the Cloud and this stimulated the emergence of Edge technology to better manage the computing applications, data, resource and services. Consequently, with the massive client size and enormous applications trying to benefit from the cloud service, it makes it a challenging task for the edge cloud data centers to work in a power saving mode. In this paper, we propose a virtual machine consolidation method to switch the idle physical servers into hibernation mode, resulting in reduced power usage. We know that edge cloud data centers offer storage as a service, in this study we address the issues pertaining to storage units in the data centers. A unique classification approach is adopted to ensure load is balanced accordingly during allocation and our main contribution is on the VM migration technique. The VM migration is aimed at consolidating the VMs based on the workload to reduced number of physical machines to mitigate the energy consumption and promoting green computing. Therefore, we name the approach as Workload Aware Virtual Machine Consolidation Method (WAVMCM). We validate the proposed method with a competitive analysis of experimental results gathered from comparing it with Artificial Intelligence based probabilistic algorithm like Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm and a case of no migration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WAVMCM reduces 9% active servers saving 15% of power consumption when compared to genetic algorithm based method.",

Events like adverse weather conditions, sick crew members, or damaged aircraft often result in delays in the airline's schedule. An airline recovers from such disruptions through the role played by its Airline Operations Control (AOC). A Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach to airline disruption management was recently proposed under the acronym MASDIMA (Multi-Agent System for Disruption Management in AOC). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate this MAS supported AOC approach on its performance and its practical introduction. This is done using a scenario-based analysis to compare the MAS supported policy to human-team based AOC policies. A task-based analysis identifies how well AOC is able to cover a set of tasks using the MAS supported policy. The scenario-based analysis shows that the MAS supported AOC is able to find the optimal solution, and to do this significantly faster. The task-based analysis identified two main challenges for implementing the MAS supported AOC policy: i) to overcome the loss of experience that is caused by significantly automating humans roles in AOC, and ii) to reduce the workload for people that remain in AOC after its introduction. The paper concludes that implementing the MAS supported AOC policy leads to both better and faster resolutions, though the replacement of human roles also poses novel challenges that remain to be resolved: a potential increase in workload for the remaining human role and loss of experience in handling exceptional situations.",

Considering the vast amount of data that composes the EEG, much of the detail inevitably escapes ordinary human scrutiny. Significant information may not be evident and is missed, and misinterpretation remains a serious problem. Can we develop an artificial intelligence system to accurately and efficiently classify EEG and even reveal novel information? In this study, deep learning techniques and, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks, have been used to develop a model (which we have named eDeeplepsy) for distinguishing different brain states in children with epilepsy. Methods A novel EEG database from a homogenous pediatric population with epileptic spasms beyond infancy was constituted by epileptologists, representing a particularly intriguing seizure type and challenging EEG. The analysis was performed on such samples from long-term video-EEG recordings, previously coded as images showing how different parts of the epileptic brain are distinctly activated during varying states within and around this seizure type. Results Results show that not only could eDeeplepsy differentiate ictal from interictal states but also discriminate brain activity between spasms within a cluster from activity away from clusters, usually undifferentiated by visual inspection. Accuracies between 86 % and 94 % were obtained for the proposed use cases. Significance We present a model for computer-assisted discrimination that can consistently detect subtle differences in the various brain states of children with epileptic spasms, and which can be used in other settings in epilepsy with the purpose of reducing workload and discrepancies or misinterpretations. The research also reveals previously undisclosed information that allows for a better understanding of the pathophysiology and evolving characteristics of this particular seizure type. It does so by documenting a different state (interspasms) that indicates a potentially non-standard signal with distinctive epileptogenicity at that period.",

The micro-pits unit cell, unit strip and the end notched flexure (ENF) models are established based on the finite element simulations and the effect of micro-pit size parameters is studied in detail. The results of micro-pits unit cell model reveal that the presence of micro-pits can effectively buffer the interfacial stress concentration under mode-II loading conditions. Furthermore, the micro-pits unit strip model, with different micro-pit sizes, is analyzed to obtain the interface parameters, which are converted and used in the ENF model. Both the unit strip and ENF models conclude that the presence of interfacial micro-pits effectively improves the mode-II fracture toughness. It is worth mentioning that the utilization of converted interface parameters in ENF model avoided the limitation of micro-pit size and reduced the workload. Finally, the experimental and computational ENF results exhibited excellent consistency and confirmed the reliability of the proposed finite element models. The current study provides useful guidelines for the design and manufacturing of high-performance TC4/PEEK interfaces for a wide range of applications.",

Recently, researchers have started to integrate sustainability issues into lot-sizing models. The focus of these works has been on environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability, however, while only few contributions studied the social aspect of this problem. Especially in in-house logistics, where a high amount of manual material handling is performed, lot-sizing decisions can have a significant impact on workload and human performance, which can have a strong influence on ergonomic parameters and thus worker welfare. The paper at hand extends previous research on ergonomic lot-sizing and introduces a new mathematical model that integrates ergonomic and economic aspects. A rest allowance function is used to take account of recovery periods that help to maintain low levels of fatigue and ergonomic risks. As recovery periods represent non-productive time, the developed integrated model permits to estimate the economic impact of different workload levels. Finally, the model is applied in a numerical study, reflecting a typical manual material handling process. Based on the results of a parametrical analysis, we illustrate the applicability and validity of this approach to different industrial contexts.",

Changes in cerebrovascular tone (vasoconstriction and vasodilation) also mediate the changes in blood flow measured by the BOLD fMRI signal. This cerebrovascular reactivity is known to vary with age. In two experiments, we demonstrate that cerebral pulse parameters measured using optical imaging can quantify changes in cerebral vascular tone, both globally and locally. In experiment 1, 51 older adults (age range=55–87) performed a voluntary breath-holding task while cerebral pulse amplitude measures were taken. We found significant pulse amplitude variations across breath-holding periods, indicating vasodilation during, and vasoconstriction after breath holding. The breath-holding index (BHI), a measure of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was derived and found to correlate with age. BHI was also correlated with performance in the Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination, even after controlling for age and education. In experiment 2, the same participants performed a Sternberg task, and changes in regional pulse amplitude between high (set-size 6) and low (set-size 2) task loads were compared. Only task-related areas in the fronto-parietal network (FPN) showed significant reduction in pulse amplitude, indicating vasodilation. Non-task-related areas such as the somatosensory and auditory cortices did not show such reductions.

Knowledge and respect for our oceans are keys for a sustainable and safe relationship between humans and the underwater. People have often used their ingenuity for adaptation to various environments and the technology for allowing divers to reach extreme places in a safe manner is developing rapidly. This paper will investigate benefits of using robots as diving buddies for aiding underwater navigation. In a typical dive mission scenario, a diver is given relative distance and bearings to an underwater target as he tries to overcome environmental influences to navigate to that target using customary diving equipment; a compass and diving computer/watch. Diving robots can introduce sensors capable of achieving advanced navigation and guiding divers even in low visibility conditions. The experiment in this paper compares these two approaches and validates the results in a simulation environment on 26 participants. The success rate in finding and reaching the targets are compared in terms of time and distance travelled.

In dairy sheep farming, practices such as the male effect (ME) supported by new precision tools (heat detector) can be used to stop the use of hormonal treatments (HT) for heat induction and synchronization. However, the effectiveness of these “hormone-free” (HF) methods for managing ewes’ reproduction remains more uncertain than that of HT. Thus, introduction of HF practices in farms currently managed with HT could imply collateral impacts on the overall functioning of the production system and affect its long-term sustainability. In this work, a new multi-agent model (called REPRIN'OV) was designed to simulate consequences of introducing a HF reproduction management on a series of biotechnical, economic and environmental farm performance indicators, including farmer workload. Three reproduction management scenarios were simulated over five consecutive years for the case study of a French dairy sheep farm considered as conventional (i.e. using HT for reproduction management). They were defined as: use of HTs and insemination (HAI); no use of HTs while preserving insemination practice (HFAI); no use of HTs and direct mating only (i.e., no insemination; HFM). Results confirm that implementing HF reproductive management without accompanying it with further changes in farm management, could negatively impact several indicators of the farm sustainability in the medium and long-term. Indeed, the HF scenarios resulted in overall lower farm biotechnical performances (e.g., −4% for the fertility rate; P < 0.05) due to a more variable heat induction. An increase in farmer's workload during the lambing period (+34% and +33% of h/L of milk in HFAI and HFM, respectively; P < 0.05) was also observed, mainly due to more staggered lambing periods. As for the simulated environmental indicators, they were increased, mostly due to the reduction of the total milk production in HF’s (e.g., +6% of farm methane emissions per L of milk for both HFAI and HFM; P < 0.05). Nevertheless, positive outcomes were also simulated in the HFs as ewes lambing peaks were lower than in HAI suggesting, e.g., a possibility to improve ewes and lamb surveillance during lambing. HF scenarios also led to higher gross margin (GM) per litre of milk produced because no HT was used, reducing the production costs compare to HAI. In addition, implementing insemination in HFAI improved farm milk production and quality (i.e., fat and protein content), which resulted in improved total GM compared to HFM. Still, the reduction in the total milk production in HFs was too important compared with the improvement of the GM per litre, resulting in a reduced total GM in these scenarios (-4% and −5% in HFAI and HFM, respectively; P < 0.05). Overall, simulation results showed that to warrant sustainable introduction of HF strategies (including ME), new frameworks in the organization of key operations at the farm level should be explored (e.g., extending reproduction or milking periods length) and trade-offs should be discussed, considering all involved stakeholders of the dairy sheep industry and the chain’s value requirements. The REPRIN’OV model, may provide an effective tool to simulate the collateral impacts of establishing HF reproductive management and could be used as a decision support system to accompany the ambitious transition towards a HF dairy sheep industry in Europe and beyond.",

Over the past four decades, Professor Neville Stanton has contributed to over 179 journal articles, book chapters and conference papers in the field of road safety. The journey from ‘thinking humans’ to ‘systems thinking’ is demonstrated in this paper through the novel application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to the categorisation of research activities. A systematic review of Neville's contributions to the field of road safety demonstrates that over the years, his research activities have evolved from investigating single technological or human performance aspects in isolation (e.g., in-vehicle information design and workload) through to the holistic analysis of much broader systems (e.g., investigating road safety as a whole). Importantly, this evolution goes hand in hand with a change in the focus and emphasis of recommendations for improvements to safety. Going forward, Neville has helped pave the way for fundamental changes and improvements to be made to road safety systems around the world.",

In this paper, we use a model-based clustering algorithm to identify and model dominant dynamics of human trust in automation among a general population. In doing so, we seek to balance the tradeoffs between a single generalized, or several individualized, models of human trust. We show that two models optimally represent the sampled population and denote the participants in the two clusters as “Followers” and “Preservers”—those with high and low propensities to trust automation, respectively. We compare the dynamics of each partially observable Markov decision process model as well their associated control policies that calibrate human trust while reducing workload in a reconnaissance mission context. The resulting control policies for varying the transparency of an automated decision aid suggest that the use of a generalized control policy would sub-optimally calibrate human trust dynamics in the general population.",5

The basic parts are produced in one area before they are transported to the other area for assembly. The assembling structures of products are either flat or multi-levelled. Sequence-dependent setup times of operations and transition times of jobs between machines are considered separately from processing times. Lot streaming is considered beforehand such that each job represents a basic part instead of a batch of identical parts. Identical subassemblies are shared by all possible assembling operations, instead of being pre-associated with any product. Makespan, total tardiness and total workload are taken as objectives to be optimised. We propose a distributed ant colony system to solve the problem and explore the Pareto front. The approach is first compared with other methods, using several sets of hypothetical test cases with different sizes and complexities; then, it is applied to solve a ball valve production scheduling problem under different scenarios. We show that the proposed approach outperforms most of the other methods for the tested problems, especially for large-scale instances, making it a valuable and competitive approach for solving practical production scheduling problems.",2

However, efficient order scheduling schemes are required to balance the load and capacity across the different sites. The present study considers the multi-site production planning problem for a real-world semiconductor wafer ingot-pulling manufacturing company owning five factories in different countries around the world. A two-phase planning model based on a lean-pull strategy is proposed. In the first phase, an available machine sends a request signal to the lean-pull logic to select appropriate orders from the central queue and accumulate them to form a production kanban. In the second phase, the fulfilled orders are assigned to the customers in such a way as to minimize the total shipping cost using a linear programming formulation. The performance of the proposed two-phase lean-pull model is compared with that of the company's existing production planning method under various workload conditions by means of numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed method achieves average improvements in the service level, average cycle time, throughput, machine utilization and profit of 6.03%, 38.48%, 22.52%, 14.26% and 12.48%, respectively.

Methods We analyzed 2,424 normal chromosomes and 544 abnormal chromosomes. A preliminary support vector machine (SVM) model was developed to evaluate the basic recognition performance on the dataset. A DCNN-based model was then proposed to process the same dataset. Results By utilizing the SVM model, the classification accuracy of 24 normal chromosomes was 86.01 %. The 32 types of normal and abnormal chromosomes got an accuracy of 85.37 %. The accuracy of the DCNN-based model performing the 24 normal chromosomal classification was 91.75 %.

Despite long-term efforts to prevent engagement in mobile phone tasks, drivers continue to use their phones while driving. To develop better policy and prevention practices, gaining an understanding of the predictors and strategies utilised by drivers who use their mobile phone for distracting tasks is necessary. Visually intensive tasks are the main interest of this investigation, e.g., texting and browsing. In an online-questionnaire in Queensland (Australia), of the 484 drivers who participated, a 33.5% (n = 162) of respondents reported using a mobile phone for texting and browsing while driving on a typical day. Answers from these participants were analysed for this study. Negative binomial regression was used to model the effect of the independent variables (personal characteristics, perceived crash risk, beliefs, workload management strategies, and police avoidance strategies) over the rate of texting/browsing events per hour driving. The final statistical model confirmed that drivers who reported previous collisions; who believed that the effects of doing the texting/browsing task would last after it was finished; and who reported keeping their phone low to avoid police had an increased texting/browsing incidence rate. Comparably, drivers who held a valid driving license for longer; who perceived larger crash risk regarding texting/browsing behaviour; who avoided mobile phone use in demanding driving conditions; and who used workload management strategies such as reduced speed when engaged in mobile phone use had a reduced texting/browsing incidence rate.

The blockchain technology promises to fulfill the requirements these key aspects of networking impose with the advantages it provides. However, the technology has certain limitations regarding its scalability and its transaction throughput rate. The advantages in security provided by blockchain comes at a cost in terms of scalability and transaction throughput rate. In this paper, a novel decentralized and distributed network architecture is presented. With its novel approach the proposed architecture aims to address these issues with network scalability and to provide an increased transaction throughput rate. Without introducing any centralization with its clusters, the proposed architecture allows the network to utilize its resources much more efficiently and effectively, which allows the participants to focus their efforts on mining, increasing the performance of the network. The architecture also proposes a novel communication handling promoting bulk communications and random workload distribution over the entire network to reduce the bottlenecking that occurs on the peers. A comparison to other state-of-the-art works, namely Bitcoin [1] and Community Clustering [2], is also presented in this paper.

This report describes the initial stage of a UCD process in which foundational design concepts were formulated. We designed a functional prototype of an EHR module intended to help clinicians to efficiently complete a summary review of an electronic patient record before an ambulatory visit. Cognitively-based studies were performed and the results used to develop a cognitive framework that subsequently guided design of a prototype. Results showed that clinicians categorized and reasoned with patient data in distinct patterns; they preferred to review relevant history in the assessment and plan section of the most recent note, to search for changes in health and for new episodes of care since the last visit and to look up current-day data such as vital signs. These basic concepts were represented in the design, for instance, by screen division into vertical thirds that had historical content to the left and most recent data to the right. Other characteristics such as visual association of contextual information or direct, one-click access to the assessment and plan section of visit notes were directly informed by our findings and refined in a series of UCD-specific iterative testing. Understanding of tasks and cognitive demands early in the UCD process was critically important for developing a tool optimized for reasoning and workflow preferences of clinicians.",

As a result, various typologies of building stocks have been developed. These typologies provide engineers and architects with rough descriptions for classifying buildings into certain periods and construction types. However, real-world applications lack objective decision-making, as these classifications are usually conducted by manual investigations of buildings. To overcome this subjective approach and to ensure the reproducibility of data acquisition, this paper proposes an image-based classification using Deep Learning (DL) methods. We present the acquisition of ground truth and describe the training and testing routines on a dataset of 5,307 images obtained in the city of Weimar (located in the Free State of Thuringia, Germany), a mid-sized city representative of eastern Germany. All building images are linked to an existing building typology, allowing a classification of buildings in ten predefined and acknowledged periods. These periods are ranging from pre-1859 to post-2002. As a benchmark, an expert human baseline is acquired, showing a lower prediction accuracy than the results obtained by DL methods. Our results highlight the potential for automation in image analysis and beneficial impacts for Building Energy Modeling (BEM) on urban scale. Thus, a trustworthy data acquisition regarding the building age holds benefits for various stakeholders in BEM (engineers, architects, policymakers as well as customers).",

A sample of 105 participants completed a 24-min overload or underload vigilance task in a research laboratory. Participants were randomly assigned to either a cognitive or sensory vigilance task, and were randomly assigned to monitor one, two, or four displays for target stimuli.

This study seeks to identify factors influencing unintended consequences of PhIS and how they affect the information quality, which can pose a risk to patient safety. Materials and Methods This qualitative, explanatory case study evaluated PhIS in ambulatory pharmacies in a hospital and a clinic. Data were collected through observations, interviews, and document analysis. We applied the socio-technical interactive analysis (ISTA) framework to investigate the socio-technical interactions of pharmacy information systems that lead to unintended consequences. We then adopted the human–organization–process–technology-fit (HOPT-fit) framework to identify their contributing and dominant factors, misfits, and mitigation measures. Results We identified 28 unintended consequences of PhIS, their key contributing factors, and their interrelations with the systems. The primary causes of unintended consequences include system rigidity and complexity, unclear knowledge, understanding, skills, and purpose of using the system, use of hybrid paper and electronic documentation, unclear and confusing transitions, additions and duplication of tasks and roles in the workflow, and time pressure, causing cognitive overload and workarounds. Recommended mitigating mechanisms include human factor principles in system design, data quality improvement for PhIS in terms of effective use of workspace, training, PhIS master data management, and communication by standardizing workarounds. Conclusion Threats to information quality emerge in PhIS because of its poor design, a failure to coordinate its functions and clinical tasks, and pharmacists’ lack of understanding of the system use.

This demands for software platforms that offer simple programming abstractions to express data analysis tasks and that can execute them in an efficient and scalable way. State-of-the-art solutions range from low-level programming primitives, which give control to the developer about communication and resource usage, but require significant effort to develop and optimize new algorithms, to high-level platforms that hide most of the complexities of parallel and distributed processing, but often at the cost of reduced efficiency. To reconcile these requirements, we developed Renoir, a novel distributed data processing platform written in Rust. Renoir provides a high-level dataflow programming model as mainstream data processing systems. It supports static and streaming data, it enables data transformations, grouping, aggregation, iterative computations, and time-based analytics, and it provides all these features incurring in a low overhead. In this paper, we present the programming model and the implementation details of Renoir. We evaluate it under heterogeneous workloads. We compare it with state-of-the-art solutions for data analysis and high-performance computing, as well as alternative research products, which offer different programming abstractions and implementation strategies. Renoir programs are compact and easy to write: developers need not care about low-level concerns such as resource usage, data serialization, concurrency control, and communication. At the same time, Renoir consistently presents comparable or better performance than competing solutions, by a large margin in several scenarios. We conclude that Renoir offers a good tradeoff between simplicity and performance, allowing developers to easily express complex data analysis tasks and achieve high performance and scalability.",

This research has an emphasis on developing a methodology with higher generalizability, which has the capability to be customized to complex underground projects. To address this issue, a new methodology that employs hierarchical neural networks to develop the WBS of complex underground projects is presented. This methodology has been applied to several tunnel case studies and it has been shown that for a real project, the model is able to generate the WBS and its activities that are comparable to those generated by a project planner. Consequently, it is concluded that these modeling methods have the capacity to significantly improve the WBSs for complex underground projects and improve key project tasks, such as workload planning, cost estimating and scheduling.",

There is no report of any clinically endorsed antiviral medications or antibodies that are successful against COVID-19. It has quickly spread everywhere, presenting tremendous well-being, financial, ecological, and social difficulties to the whole human populace. The COVID flare-up is seriously disturbing the worldwide economy. Practically all the countries are battling to hinder the transmission of the malady by testing and treating patients, isolating speculated people through contact following, confining huge social affairs, keeping up total or incomplete lockdown, etc. Proper scheduling of nursing workers and optimal designation of nurses may significantly affect the quality of clinical facilities. It is delivered by eliminating unbalanced workloads or undue stress, which could lead to decreased nurse performance and potential human errors., Nurses are frequently asked to leave while caring for all sick patients. However, regular scheduling formulas are not thought to consider this possibility because they are out of scheduling control in typical scenarios. In this paper, a novel model of the Hybrid Salp Swarm Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (HSSAGA) is proposed to solve nurses’ scheduling and designation. The findings of the suggested test function algorithm demonstrate that this algorithm has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches.",

When the performance depends on multiple sources of information, the variation could be either due to changes in processing each source or the efficiency of combining the sources. The capacity coefficient is a frequently used statistic for measuring the efficiency of combining multiple sources of information, but in most applications the analyses assume stationary performance across trials. A trial-varying capacity measure would be valuable in determining the nature of the change over trials but dropping the stationarity assumption results in a severe loss in power. In this work, we develop a Bayesian trial-varying model of the capacity coefficient to estimate the efficiency of an individual processing multiple sources of information. This model is based on the Weibull distribution to approximately characterize the processing time of each source, with an inverse gamma distribution prior for the scale parameter and a known shape. This approach provided us a tractable way to update prior estimates for real-time estimation of capacity across trials. We demonstrate the approach with both simulated and human data.",

Despite the fact that a number of software tools have been developed (McGuire, 1976, 1978; Bender & Perkins, 1982, 1987; Robinson et al., 2005, 2006; Field et al., 2003), map resolution is generally low, potentially leading to uncertainty in calculations of ground motion level and underestimation of the seismic hazard in a region. In order to generate higher resolution maps, the biggest challenge is to handle the significantly increased data processing workload. In this study, a method for improving seismic hazard map resolution is presented that employs a pipelining implementation of the existing EqHaz program suite (Assatourians & Atkinson, 2013) based on IBM InfoSphere Streams–an advanced stream computing platform. Its architecture is specifically configured for continuous analysis of massive volumes of data at high speeds and low latency. Specifically, it treats processing workload as data streams. Processing procedures are implemented as operators that are connected to form processing pipelines. To handle large processing workload, these pipelines are flexible and scalable to be deployed and run in parallel on large-scale HPC clusters to meet application performance requirements. As a result, mean hazard calculations are possible for maps with resolution up to 2,500,000 points with near-real-time processing time of approximately 5-6minutes.",

To handle workload variations and provide performance guarantees, dynamic network scheduling scheme is highly desired in NCSs. In this paper, we propose a network scheduling scheme, referred to as DTS, that can make on-the-fly decisions to schedule the applications in NCSs. DTS aims at NCSs that use time-triggered network as shared medium and Time division multiple access (TDMA) as network access method. DTS dynamically changes the network accessing sequence of the applications in a way to provide optimal system performance and maintain control stability in NCSs. DTS adopts a decentralized schedule mechanism where each application can make its local schedule decision, enhancing the scalability of NCSs.

The moment-rotation relation is indispensable in the design of this connection; however, the current moment-rotation relation models require experimental or simulation data to fit their shape parameters and physical parameters, which results in large cost of time, economy, human resource and material resource. Therefore, a practical analytical model for the moment-rotation relation of this connection, i.e. the ultimate moment resistance and initial rotational stiffness based two-parameter exponential model, is proposed. With consideration of the possible failure modes, calculation methods for predicting ultimate moment resistance is developed using dimension parameters and material properties of the connection without any experimental or simulation data. Prediction results based on the proposed analytical model of moment-rotation relation and calculation methods of ultimate moment resistance show good agreements with experimental results, and the failure mode of this connection can also be predicted well. The proposed analytical model can be used in the design and structural analysis of the semi-rigid composite frames to predict the moment-rotation relation accurately; moreover, the proposed model avoids the workload of simulations and experiments, which is simple and convenient for engineers.",

At the front end of the software a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed that allows designers to create digital mockups of the designs and simulate drivers performing secondary tasks while steering a vehicle. To validate the software outputs, an experiment using human drivers was conducted on a fix-based driving simulator with a radio-tuning task as a test case.

In this regard, the purpose of this study was to further confirm the appropriateness of the TACOM measure by comparing human error data collected from a full-scope simulator of a domestic Korean nuclear power plant with the associated TACOM scores. Results show that the number of human errors increases proportionally with an increase in TACOM score.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these influential factors remain unclear. This study aims to explore the interactive effects of sleep patterns, driving task, and time-on-task on driving behavior and eye-motion metrics among short-haul truck drivers. We obtained test data from eleven professional short-haul truck drivers, with each driver participating in a three-day test under the conditions of two driving tasks and three different sleep patterns. We applied three-way repeated-measure ANOVA and non-parametric tests to analyze the data. The results reveal that: (1) violation of sleep-related legal requirements, insufficient sleep, and unreasonable time-on-task can have negative effects on short-haul truck drivers' vigilance and driving performance; (2) both driving task and sleep pattern contribute to driver fatigue, and the interaction of time-on-task and sleep pattern exacerbates driver fatigue more than the effects of any single factor alone; and (3) short-haul truck drivers who are sleep deprived exhibit short periods of controlled compensatory behavior during the outbound task, and sleepiness is more prevalent during the inbound task compared to the outbound task due to the monotony and low workload of the driving process. These findings provide theoretical and practical guidance for transportation industry managers to strengthen company-wide fatigue-related regulations, ensure adequate sleep for drivers via regulations, and optimize work schedules to improve safety outcomes of short-haul truck drivers.",

However, the diagnosis often requires a second opinion from experienced radiologists, who are usually overwhelmed by many cases. Therefore, we propose a deep convolutional neural network model, named biliary tract network (BiTNet), developed to solve problems in the current screening system and to avoid overconfidence issues of traditional deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we present an ultrasound image dataset for the human biliary tract and demonstrate two artificial intelligence (AI) applications: auto-prescreening and assisting tools. The proposed model is the first AI model to automatically screen and diagnose upper-abdominal abnormalities from ultrasound images in real-world healthcare scenarios. Our experiments suggest that prediction probability has an impact on both applications, and our modifications to EfficientNet solve the overconfidence problem, thereby improving the performance of both applications and of healthcare professionals. The proposed BiTNet can reduce the workload of radiologists by 35% while keeping the false negatives to as low as 1 out of every 455 images. Our experiments involving 11 healthcare professionals with four different levels of experience reveal that BiTNet improves the diagnostic performance of participants of all levels. The mean accuracy and precision of the participants with BiTNet as an assisting tool (0.74 and 0.61, respectively) are statistically higher than those of participants without the assisting tool (0.50 and 0.46, respectively (p<0.001)).

The experimental results demonstrated an average accuracy of 99.08% and f1-score 98.73 for the segmentation of the epicardial fat and 97.90% of accuracy and f1-score of 98.40 for the mediastinal fat. These findings represent the high precision and overlap agreement achieved by the proposed methodology. In comparison to existing studies, our approach exhibited superior performance in terms of f1-score and run time, enabling the images to be segmented in real time.",

This study introduces an innovative approach employing flight data, machine learning, and Continuous Performance Test (CPT) metrics to predict pilot performance and SA during instrument approaches under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Data were collected from over 10 pilots across more than 40 flights in a high-fidelity Cessna 172 analog flight simulator. Significant correlations were observed between dynamic cognitive performance parameters and the exceedance shape factor, a novel measure of pilot sustained attention introduced in this research. Key variables identified through correlation analysis included variability, interstimulus change, and reaction time standard deviation. Importantly, commission scores and reaction time standard deviation emerged as key predictors in the machine learning model, specifically the Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with a radial basis function kernel. The model achieved a validation R-squared of 0.90 and a test R-squared of 0.70. These systems could incorporate additional data sources, such as eye-tracking and scan pattern analysis, for a better assessment of pilot SA and fatigue levels. While post-flight measurements are inherently reactive, they are effective for monitoring the degradation of pilot CPT scores after each leg of high-frequency, short-duration flights. Notable limitations include the need to understand individual cognitive differences among pilots, such as age, experience, and cognitive style. The predictive model also requires validation in actual flight conditions to determine its ecological validity. Future research should aim to address these limitations, generalize the findings, and integrate CPT data with other sensor inputs to provide a more comprehensive understanding of pilot performance.",

Contrarily, control dashboards are usually intrusive, full of controls and not really intuitive or usable. This paper focuses on the design of ergonomic and usable dashboard for specific classes of vehicles, like tractors and trucks. Indeed, trucks and tractors are both vehicles and operating machines, and their control is particularly complex. Indeed, the driver contemporary drives and checks if the machine is working properly. The paper proposes an innovative methodology to design highly usable and compact dashboards inspired by human-centered design and ergonomics principles. The study started by shifting the attention from the machine performance, that is the conventional engineering approach, to the human-system interaction quality, according to a new, transdisciplinary approach. The methodology proposes to combine virtual simulations with human performance analysis to support the design at different stages, from concept generation to detailed design, until testing with users. The methodology uses virtual environments to create digital twins of both driver and controls, making users interact with virtual items and predict the type and nature of interaction. Within virtual scenarios, different configurations of dashboard controls can be easily compared and tested, checking the frequency of use of each control and measuring the achieved human performance related to postural comfort and mental workload. The study adopted the proposed methodology to two industrial use cases focusing on the design of ergonomic dashboards: the former is referred to tractor dashboard and armrest, the latter refers to truck dashboard and seat. Both cases demonstrated that the new methodology allowed improved comfort, higher usability, higher visibility and accessibility, better performance and reduced time for machine control. The study demonstrates how a multidisciplinary user information integration can drive design optimization.",

However, it is challenging to accurately detect sleep spindles due to the complexity of the human brain and the uncertainty of neural mechanisms. To improve the reliability and objectivity of sleep spindle detection and to compensate for the limitations of manual annotation, this study proposes a new automatic detection algorithm based on Matching Pursuit (MP) and Least Squares Boosting (LSBoost), where the automatic sleep spindle detection algorithm can help reduce the visual annotation workload of sleep clinicians. Specifically, MP is a time-frequency analysis method suitable for extracting spindle wave characteristics, which can accurately locate spindle waves on a time-frequency plane. LSBoost is an ensemble learning classification method to deal with unbalanced data. Initially, the MP method is used to search for EEG segments that are possible spindle waves from the filtered raw EEG data. Then, the designed feature segments are thrown into the LSBoost classifier to further identify the real spindles from all candidates and output the final results. The proposed method is verified on the common public dataset DREAMS. The experiment results show that the sensitivity and F1-scores based on the sample-based assessments achieve 68.2% and 55.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the Recall and F1-score based on the event assessments are 83.8% and 70.8%, respectively. These results show that the proposed algorithm is robust to the subject changes in the DREAMS dataset. In addition, it improves the quality of sleep spindle detection, which is expected to assist the manual marking of experts.",2

To this end, it proposes a multi-period mathematical formulation that decides on the location of potential stockyards and the quantities to move from suppliers to yards and from yards to factories at each period. The formulation accounts for the wood's weight loss achieved by natural drying at the stockyard. Drying depends on the number of periods that the wood stays in the yard but also on the particular weather conditions during the length of stay. The formulation also incorporates the dynamic seasonal restrictions on the allowed payload, in an attempt to mitigate their economic impact on transportation costs. Numerical results on randomly generated instances, as well as a real instance provided by a large pulp and paper producer in Québec, Canada, show that important improvements on the logistics’ costs can be achieved by explicitly considering these aspects.",

Prediction of those distortions is the key to understand the distortion mechanism and derive optimized machining strategies. In this paper, a high efficient surface based method was proposed to predict the part distortion in machining and shot peening. In this method, the surface residual stress field is mathematically analyzed and equivalent to a group of face and edge loads. The part distortion problem is equivalent to an elastic deformation problem and is solved by the FEM software. The knowledge of surface differential geometry is used so that the method could handle part with curved surfaces. Compared with the existing method, the refinement of mesh in the surface-affected layer is not needed, which not only greatly decreases the workload and difficulty of mesh generation but also significantly reduces the amount of computation. What is more, the method was found to be particular fit for large curved surface parts such as propellers and blades. Software system was developed further to implement the method. Two examples were given to show the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, the method was verified by comparing the simulated results with the experimental data with a marine propeller example.",

Energy management technologies have been proposed for energy-efficient scheduling of computing workloads and for allocating resources in such computing infrastructures. One of the important factors for this energy management is the estimation of power consumption as a result of the workload schedule to be carried out. The commonly used power models are a linear function of resource features. Based on measurement data sets from our cluster, we extended power model study to multiple non-linear dependencies. We provide several novel contributions: we apply neural network models and unsupervised classification models with basic OS-reported resource features for power estimation; we build and test the power estimation models in a cluster environment from a large size of measurement data; we evaluate the power estimation models in terms of not only accuracy but also portability and usability. We prove that a multiple-variable linear regression approach is more precise than a CPU-only linear approach. The neural network approaches have a slight advantage – their mean root mean square error is at most 15% less than that of the multiple-variable linear model. The neural network models have worse portability when the models generated on a node are applied on other homogeneous nodes. Gaussian Mixture Model has the highest accuracy but requires the longest training time.

To this end, the paper proposes a novel AR tool to assist operators during the inspection activities for the detection of production and assembly errors. In fact, thanks to the superimposition of the 3D models, as designed by the technical office, a worker can easily detect the presence of design discrepancies on the final physical assembled product and report them by adding 3D annotations directly on virtual models. This AR tool has been developed by using ARCore™ libraries to ensure, in the first place, its compatibility with commonly used devices for which workers are already trained and, secondly, to take advantage of the hybrid-tracking techniques that combine vision- and sensor-based methods to improve the reliability of the AR visualization. Nevertheless, the proposed AR tool adopts multiple markers to minimize tracking errors and therefore to provide greater freedom of movement to the user, who can use the tool also for the assessment of large-size products. Field experimentations have been carried out on a real case study with end-users in order to assess its usability and perceived mental workload through the SUS (System Usability Scale) and NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) standard questionnaires, respectively. The usability study was performed taking into account also objective metrics, i.e., by analysing user performance in target acquisition tasks while interacting with the AR tool. Statistical analysis proved that the adoption of this AR tool requires low mental demand, and its usability has reached a high level of satisfaction both by the factory workers and engineers involved in the user study.",

Secondly, the QBGA-GRU model is used for signal reconstruction prediction, where QBGA is an improved genetic algorithm proposed in this article that can improve prediction accuracy. Finally, the IPSO-BLS algorithm is used to quickly analyze and predict prediction errors and further correct the predicted results.

Grandmothers are often highlighted as key allomothers (non-maternal caregivers) and their presence is frequently associated with increased child survivorship, leading some to describe humans as cooperative breeders. Equally well documented is the diversity of human childcare systems, where a wide range of individuals support parents including male kin. However, the role of grandfathers has been less well documented, and they seem to have an inconsistent relationship with child survivorship, dependent on socio-ecological factors. Here, we explore the relationship between grandparental allomothering and child survivorship using demographic and time budget data from a pastoralists community in western China. We find that under-five mortality is negatively associated with grandpaternal, but not grandmaternal, living status. Pastoralists in Maqu have recently transitioned from mobile to half-settled livelihoods in which women are more economically active than males. As a result, women's childcare workloads have decreased, while older men (who are excluded from the household economy) supervise children.

Empirical studies show that 90% of the final assembly tasks are still performed by humans and in most cases solely relying on own experience. Because of the product complexity and the operational complexity, caused by the mixed model structure, the mental workload imposed on the operators is typically high. Consequently, the probability of errors is higher and delays may occur. Cognitive automation ensures that the mental workload imposed on the operator will be reduced. This paper will focus on a method for evaluating the performance of a manual mixed model assembly system equipped with a cognitive information system. For this purpose a framework is designed. The framework is categorized in three inner sections: product, workstation and operator data. These sections will define the mixed model assembly system and create a performance score. Further, a technical description of a cognitive information system is given. The cognitive information system will support the operator, both intrinsic and extrinsic, by offering him process related information. The cognitive information systems have three important aspects: what, how and when. Also, configuration opportunities are added to the information system in which the operator is able to configure his own system.",3

The main objective of this paper is to generalize such paradigm to cross-subject OFS recognition by exploiting the new improvements in deep learning principles. To this end, we propose a novel EEG-based OFS classifier, switching deep belief networks with adaptive weights (SDBN), which is generic for detecting variations of mental workload, mental fatigue, and the coupling effect of the two variables across multiple subjects. The temporal OFS is predicted by switching the ensembles of the static and adaptive DBNs at each time step via a Gaussian-kernel based criterion.

Thirty-eight participants performed three tasks of the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB), in which the system monitoring task was automated and adopted as the takeover task, while tracking and resource management tasks were employed as the initial tasks simultaneously. The results showed that compared with the single-stage warning system, the two-stage warning system enhanced situation awareness, reduced mental workload and improved takeover performance. However, tracking task performance declined when the two-stage warning system was used. Moreover, participants using the two-stage warning system reacted to gauge malfunctions much more quickly than participants using the single-stage warning system when the interruption strategy was adopted. However, there was no significant difference in tracking task performance between the two warning systems when the multitasking strategy was adopted. This study concluded that the two-stage warning system can benefit the takeover process but at the cost of the performance of initial tasks, and the takeover strategy plays an important role in realizing the benefits of the two-stage warning system and alleviating its costs. These findings could provide useful insights for automated system design and personnel training.",

First, we identify six management functions that algorithms are currently able to perform: monitoring, goal setting, performance management, scheduling, compensation, and job termination. Second, we show how each AM function affects key job resources (e.g., job autonomy, job complexity) and key job demands (e.g., workload, physical demands); with each of these resources and demands being important drivers of worker motivation and their well-being. Third, rejecting a deterministic perspective and drawing on sociotechnical systems theory, we outline key categories of variables that moderate the link between AM on work design, namely transparency, fairness and human influence (e.g., whether workers can control the system). We summarize our review in the form of a model to help guide research on AM, and to support practitioners and designers in the creation and maintenance of meaningful jobs in the era of algorithms.",3

For this purpose Google developed MapReduce, a parallel programming paradigm which is slowly becoming the de facto tool for Big Data analytics. Although to some extent its use is already wide-spread in the industry, ensuring performance constraints for such a complex system poses great challenges and its management requires a high level of expertise. This paper answers these challenges by providing the first autonomous controller that ensures service time constraints of a concurrent MapReduce workload. We develop the first dynamic model of a MapReduce cluster. Furthermore, PI feedback control is developed and implemented to ensure service time constraints. A feedforward controller is added to improve control response in the presence of disturbances, namely changes in the number of clients. The approach is validated online on a real 40 node MapReduce cluster, running a data intensive Business Intelligence workload. Our experiments demonstrate that the designed control is successful in assuring service time constraints.",3

The majority of breaches in cybersecurity have been attributed to human error. Intensive care departments are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. The aim of this study was to investigate cybersecurity awareness, knowledge and behaviours among critical care staff. Methods This was a multi-site cross-sectional survey study administered to critical care staff. Cybersecurity awareness was evaluated using the validated HAIS-Q instrument. Knowledge and behaviours were evaluated by direct questioning and scenario-based multiple-choice questions. Free text options were also offered to respondents. Thematic analysis was performed on free text sections. Results Median scores of 12–15 in each of the HAIS-Q focus areas were achieved, indicating high levels of cybersecurity awareness among critical care staff. However, self-reported confidence in cybersecurity practices, especially identifying signs of cybersecurity breaches and reporting cybersecurity incidents, were relatively low. Participants responses to the scenarios demonstrated a lack of knowledge and awareness of some of the mechanisms of cyberattacks. Barriers to safe cybersecurity practices among staff that emerged from the qualitative analysis included: a lack of training and education; heavy workloads and staff fatigue; perceived lack of IT support and poor IT infrastructure. Conclusion Critical care staff appear to have a high-level cybersecurity awareness. However, in practice safe cybersecurity practices are not always followed. ICU departments and hospitals must invest in the human aspect of cybersecurity to strength their cyber-defences and to protect patients.",

More than one-decade, the cloud computing paradigm has changed the way of computing, communication, and technology. The efficient resource provisioning or task scheduler policy improvement is a challenging issue in the service-oriented computing paradigm. This article work focuses on task scheduler policy improvement for better cloud application performance. The task scheduling algorithm aims to improve the performance of real-time applications in the cloud by reducing task waiting time, execution time, and power consumption. The proposed model is inspired by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system with a training model using a genetic algorithm. Results exhibit that the proposed GA-ANN policy outperforms the (Big-Bang Big-Crunch cost-aware), Genetic cost-aware, and other existing approaches. The results show that the proposed GA-ANN model performs better than existing approaches taking power consumption, total completion time(ms), average start time (ms), and average completion time(ms) as performance metrics. The proposed GA-ANN model is validated using real-time user requests (standard workload file) from workload traces (San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Blue Horizon logs), and fabricated data sets. The proposed model improves power efficiency by 13 %, scheduling time by 77.14 % and total execution time by 36 %. Hence the proposed GA-ANN technique provides performance as compared to existing systems.",

This has led to increased failure occurrence within computing systems that induce substantial negative impact upon system performance and task reliability perceived by users. Such systems also consume vast quantities of power, resulting in significant operational costs perceived by providers. Virtualization – a commonly deployed technology within Cloud datacenters – can enable flexible scheduling of virtual machines to maximize system reliability and energy-efficiency. However, existing work address these two objectives separately, providing limited understanding towards studying the explicit trade-offs towards dependable and energy-efficient compute infrastructure. In this paper, we propose two failure-aware energy-efficient scheduling algorithms that exploit the holistic operational characteristics of the Cloud datacenter comprising the cooling unit, computing infrastructure and server failures. By comprehensively modeling the power and failure profiles of a Cloud datacenter, we propose workload scheduling algorithms Ella-W and Ella-B, capable of reducing cooling and compute energy while minimizing the impact of system failures. A novel and overall metric is proposed that combines energy efficiency and reliability to specify the performance of various algorithms. We evaluate our algorithms against Random, MaxUtil, TASA, MTTE and OBFIT under various system conditions of failure prediction accuracy and workload intensity. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ella-W can reduce energy usage by 29.5% and improve task completion rate by 3.6%, while Ella-B reduces energy usage by 32.7% with no degradation to task completion rate.",

This study aims to focus on the particular case of teleworkers and the work conditions which may hinder their well-being. More specifically, this study analyses the impact of social isolation and work overload on the work engagement and life satisfaction of teleworkers during COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach With a sample of 188 workers from the Portuguese banking sector, the authors use structural equations modelling to test a conceptual model. The authors carry out data analysis with partial least squares. Findings Social isolation and work overload are both negatively associated with the three dimensions of work engagement, namely, vigour, absorption and dedication. In turn, vigour is positively associated with life satisfaction. Social isolation and work overload are indirectly associated with life satisfaction through vigour. Results from multi-group analysis show that the negative relationship between social isolation and dedication is stronger for less senior teleworkers. By contrast, the negative relationship between work overload and dedication is stronger for more senior teleworkers. Additionally, the positive relationship between vigour and life satisfaction is stronger for permanent workers than for temporary ones. Originality/value This study tests the assumptions of the job demands-resources under the novel conditions of telework during COVID-19, focusing its ubiquitous conditions – social isolation and work overload. For human resources managers, this study highlights the need to take seniority and job stability in consideration when devising onboarding and working arrangement strategies for teleworkers.",5

Not only in manual driving, the driver state information is also interesting to consider in automated driving systems in order to provide the driver with a suitable assistance level in respect to his evolving needs. The concepts of adaptive automation and human machine cooperation suggest that the authority of the automation should be adapted in real time according to the situation. However, contrary to existing studies that demonstrated the benefits for continuous fixed haptic feedback in the lane keeping task, evidence regarding the potential benefits of online adaptation of the level of haptic feedback is still lacking. In this framework a study is conducted in order to investigate the effects of online adjusting the authority level of a lane keeping assist system to match the driver’s distraction state while engaging in a demanding secondary task. The study took place in the SHERPA-lamih driving simulator. A comparison has been made between manual driving asa baseline, a Lane keeping Assist (LKA) providing a fixed and continuous haptic feedback and an Adaptive Lane Keeping Assist (ALKA). The analysis accounted for the driving performance and effort along with the subjective ratings of comfort, safety, control and workload. The results were consistent with the previous studies that showed the benefits of fixed haptic feedback under normal driving conditions. Moreover, the study established the benefits of adapting the level of haptic authority when the drivers were engaged in a secondary task.

This study involved an e-Leprosy framework being integrated into the real setting of a leprosy control program in Indonesia. The objectives of this implementation study were to integrate e-Leprosy into a leprosy control program at 27 PHCs in Pekalongan District. Central Java Province, Indonesia to explore factors related the success or failure of such an implementation regarding the usability, involvement, and acceptance of e-Leprosy by PHC staff and to evaluate the effect of the implementation on leprosy patient attendance at PHCs. This paper is based on the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) statement. Method This study used mixed methods implementation research with longitudinal analysis and involved two groups of participants: Leprosy Surveillance Officers (LSOs), patients, and the relatives of patients. This study involved four phases consisting of preparation, baseline assessment, intervention, and evaluation. The qualitative study conducted focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The e-Leprosy program automatically sent SMS reminders regarding leprosy treatment to the LSOs, patients, and patients’ relatives every month. Findings This study determined that LSO had difficulties related to their workloads in PHCs while managing information and monitoring treatment and contact after release from treatment. The baseline assessment phase found that LSOs in Pekalongan District were unfamiliar with email but familiar using the internet. Overall, LSOs had a positive perception of the e-Leprosy program. The usability of this e-Leprosy program tended to increase over time, while acceptance of the e-Leprosy exhibited a significant relationship with computer and internet fluency (r = 0.48, p < 0.05) and age (r = 0.621, p < 0.01). The responsible patients correlated (r = 0.67, p < 0.01) with involvement in the e-Leprosy program. This study revealed that patient reminders increased on-time attendance by 13.9 % (p < 0.01 with OR = 2.41). Conclusion Factors that should be considered during implementation HIS included the digital gap, PHC’s staff workload, as well as the level of commitment and leadership in the health office.",

Usually, blade profile is measured by coordinate measuring machine (CMM) in mass production. Since the measurement time and cost increase proportionally as the increase of sampling points, it is essential to study a sampling method that can answer two basically different sampling problems: how many blades need to be sampled from mass production, and how many points need to be measured for a blade. This paper calculates the sample size for statistical analysis with sufficient confidence and accuracy. The correlation analysis for profile deviations of cross sections (e.g. rotation parameters) and cross-sectional points (e.g. point to point normal distances) is conducted, and the proposed method is carried out through traversing the neighboring Spearman rank correlation coefficient and noting low correlations between each other. The studied cases of two real blades indicated that the proposed statistical sampling method can improve measurement efficiency and ensure the measurement accuracy of mass-produced blades.",

Despite the importance of perception-action coupling, little is known about modification of those perceptions with changing physical or cognitive STATE. It is hypothesized that changing values for perceived affordances could evidence these modifications. A better understanding of how worker characteristics (e.g., level of fatigue) affect perceptions of affordance and their corresponding behaviours, may help when developing strategies for ergonomic best practices, particularly in manual material handling (MMH) activities. The aim of this study was to compare safe perceptions of affordance from workers that completed repetitive STATE loading. Seventy-five novice MMH workers (23 male; mean age = 21.43, SD = 3.24) made perceived affordances of their safest horizontal reaching distance (acceptable limit) to complete a model task. STATE loading consisted of physical or cognitive fatigue or a control. The levels of fatigue were assessed at five-minute intervals using Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) values and Multi-Fatigue Inventory (MFI) values, respectively. A significant main effect of TIME indicated a decrease of perceived safest reaching distance observed from baseline through subsequent measurements (p<.001). The magnitude of these changes did not differ significantly between groups, suggesting that general learning more than specific STATE loading may be a major contributor to modification of affordance perceptions. However, it remains important to consider TIME and STATE influences on perceptions for safe occupational handling. Novice workers’ initial perceptions of safe working affordance may put them at risk for soft tissue injury. Physical and cognitive loading similarly affect perceived safe affordances.",

Recently, researchers have started to integrate sustainability issues into lot-sizing models. The focus of these works has been on environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability, however, while only few contributions studied the social aspect of this problem. Especially in in-house logistics, where a high amount of manual material handling is performed, lot-sizing decisions can have a significant impact on workload and human performance, which can have a strong influence on ergonomic parameters and thus worker welfare. The paper at hand extends previous research on ergonomic lot-sizing and introduces a new mathematical model that integrates ergonomic and economic aspects. A rest allowance function is used to take account of recovery periods that help to maintain low levels of fatigue and ergonomic risks. As recovery periods represent non-productive time, the developed integrated model permits to estimate the economic impact of different workload levels. Finally, the model is applied in a numerical study, reflecting a typical manual material handling process. Based on the results of a parametrical analysis, we illustrate the applicability and validity of this approach to different industrial contexts.",

The GHG study conducted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) indicates that the sector accounted for 2.2% and 2.89 % of emissions in 2012 and 2018, respectively. As a result, IMO has endorsed strategies to reduce ship-induced emissions to 50% by 2050 and net zero emissions by 2100. For reducing carbon emissions, regulations such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) were implemented a decade ago. We collected data from 104 seafarers in 24 countries using purposive sampling, exploring how the energy-efficient operation of ships transforms their work cultures onboard ships. The majority of seafarers in our study agreed that energy-efficient ship operation has changed seafarers' working cultures over the last decade. Seafarers have adopted a variety of energy efficiency (EE) practices, including meticulous record-keeping of fuel consumption and adherence to Planned Maintenance Systems. As well as preparing for Port State Control (PSC) inspections, they follow energy-saving measures prescribed by the SEEMP. In addition to engine maintenance, energy-saving practices, accurate reporting and recording of EE-related data, and efficient power usage, they provide just-in-time arrival, crew training, energy-efficient lighting, environmental awareness, and slow steaming to minimize fuel consumption. The majority of seafarers implemented SEEMP successfully and met the company's objectives, but they did not receive any form of recognition or financial incentives. Although SEEMP can help shipping companies gain financial benefits and preserve the environment, seafarers do not receive tangible rewards or appreciation for implementing it. Only one-fourth of seafarers were rewarded with incentives, bonuses, formal recognition, or trophies. This study holds significant implications for policymakers, offering insight into seafarers' adaptation to energy-efficient ship operations and advocating for integrating Industry 4.0 technologies for EE regulations compliance by reducing seafarers' workloads and improving data accuracy.",

This research followed a two-phase experimental approach. The first phase applied the proposed model and identified a performance baseline for each individual in a multitasking environment, MATB-II. The second phase validated the proposed model using a rearranged set of multitasks for each individual. Individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) have been estimated as predictors of varying cognitive abilities. This study also investigated the relationship between WMC, task difficulty, and multitasking performance. Significant improvement of user performance was found after the rearrangement of tasks based on the proposed approach. This research provides a framework to quantitatively evaluate multitasking systems and improve human performance in order to understand the interaction between systems and human operators.",

These two problems are interrelated as the tasks durations are not predefined, but depend on the number of workers assigned to that task as well as their skill levels. We here present a mixed integer linear programming model that considers important real life aspects related to the flexibility in the use of human resources, such as multi-skilled workers whose skill levels are different and measured by their efficiencies. Hence, execution times of the same workload by different workers vary according to these efficiencies. Moreover, the model considers the flexible working time of employees; i.e. the daily and weekly workload of a given worker may vary from one period to another according to the work required. Furthermore, efficient team building is incorporated in this model; i.e. assigning an expert worker and one or more apprentice worker(s) together with the purpose of skill development thanks to knowledge transfer. A numerical example is provided to check the performance of the model.",1

Since the system-to-user provision of information is becoming more proactive, mainly via push notifications that often cause interruption at the users’ side, attention management is becoming very important. Despite the many existing studies concerned with detecting opportune moments to present such push information to the users (in a way that preserves the user’s attention and lowers their cognitive load and frustration), there is little evaluation of such systems in the real-world production environments. Overlooked areas of study also include the examination of real users and notification contents. In this paper, we present various results from the first extensive evaluation on user’s interruptibility and engagement in the real-world environment with a market-leading smartphone application that boasts a large number of users, including real notification content on the application. Following our previous mobile-sensing and machine learning-based interruptibility estimation approach, which was an effective study in its own right (Okoshi et al., 2015 [18,19]), we embedded a logic with the same approach in the “Yahoo! JAPAN” Android app (one of the most popular applications on the national market). The results from our large-scale in-the-wild user study (that included more than 680,000 users and spanned three weeks) indicate that, in most cases, delaying the notification delivery until an interruptible moment is detected is beneficial to users. The practice results in significant reduction of user response time (49.7%) when compared to delivering the notifications immediately. We observed a higher number of notifications opened in our system and constant improvement in user engagement levels throughout the entire study period. We also observed differences in click rates among different days and time among users with different attributes (e.g., age, gender, and occupation). Additional evaluation of our revised system, which can train and distribute different models for weekdays and weekends, improved the click rates during weekends. This negated the performance degradation previously observed during weekends.",

REBA is widely used tool due to its convenience and consideration of all body parts. However, it heavily relies on the subjective judgments of the assessor, leading to inconsistencies in results, and lacks sensitivity in detecting small changes in ergonomic risk factors. Therefore, there is a need to improve the REBA method by integrating it with new technologies. While a few studies have proposed integrating ergonomic risk measurement tools with ANNs, there is a research gap in comparing different types of neural networks and membership functions to determine the most effective approach for improving the performance of REBA. Additionally, there is a need to apply these integrations to real-life case studies to demonstrate their effectiveness in practice. This study proposes a comparative neural network and neuro-fuzzy-based REBA method that includes various types of neural networks and membership functions. The proposed method is applied to service employee who have experienced increased workloads due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The results show that the neuro-fuzzy method is more accurate than the REBA and provides greater flexibility in defining which member belongs to which risk level cluster. This study is critical because it addresses research gaps in integrating neural networks and REBA and applies these integrations to a real-life case study. By comparing different types of neural networks and membership functions, the study provides insights into which approaches are most effective for improving the performance of REBA.",

These movements are not usually designed to communicate and are frequently accomplished with little or no awareness. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether sFSTG are associated with specific changes in the electrical brain activity that might indicate an involvement of regulatory emotional processes and working memory. Fourteen subjects performed a delayed memory task of complex haptic stimuli. The stimuli had to be explored and then remembered for a retention interval of 5min. The retention interval was interrupted by unpleasant sounds from The International Affective Digitized Sounds and short sound-free periods. During the experiment a video stream of behavior, 19-channel EEG, and EMG (of forearm muscles) were recorded. Comparisons of the behavioral data and spectral power of different EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) were conducted. An increase of sFSTG during the application of unpleasant sounds was observed. A significant increase of spectral theta and beta power was observed after exploration of the stimuli as well as after sFSTG in centro-parietal electrodes. The spectral theta power extremely decreased just before sFSTG during the retention interval. Contrary to this, no significant changes were detected in any of the frequencies when the spectral power before and after instructed facial self-touch movements (b-iFSTG and a-iFSTG) were compared. The changes of spectral theta power in the intervals before and after sFSTG in centro-parietal electrodes imply that sFSTG are associated with cortical regulatory processes in the domains of working memory and emotions.",

However, concerns exist about the psychological state of the platooning driver, who is exempted from direct control, yet remains responsible for monitoring the outside environment to detect potential threats. By means of a driving simulator experiment, we investigated the effects on recorded and self-reported measures of workload and stress for three task-instruction conditions: (1) No Task, in which participants had to monitor the road, (2) Voluntary Task, in which participants could do whatever they wanted, and (3) Detection Task, in which participants had to detect red cars. Twenty-two participants performed three 40-min runs in a constant-speed platoon, one condition per run in counterbalanced order. Contrary to some classic literature suggesting that humans are poor monitors, in the Detection Task condition participants attained a high mean detection rate (94.7%) and a low mean false alarm rate (0.8%). Results of the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire indicated that automated platooning was less distressing in the Voluntary Task than in the Detection Task and No Task conditions. In terms of heart rate variability, the Voluntary Task condition yielded a lower power in the low-frequency range relative to the high-frequency range (LF/HF ratio) than the Detection Task condition. Moreover, a strong time-on-task effect was found, whereby the mean heart rate dropped from the first to the third run. In conclusion, participants are able to remain attentive for a prolonged platooning drive, and the type of monitoring task has effects on the driver's psychological state.",

Remote operation could facilitate the development of autonomous vehicles in a safe and efficient manner by putting a human in the loop without the need for the human to be physically present in the vehicle. In the current experiment, three aspects of remote driving have been investigated in a driving simulator to evaluate the effect of i) latency, ii) type of task to perform, and iii) speed on a number of performance measures. Method Thirty-one participants drove in simulated rural (high-speed) and urban (low-speed) scenarios. Five hazards were created for each scenario and the participants drove each scenario three times with different latencies (baseline, +100 ms, and +200 ms). The latency condition was masked for the participants. The hazards were designed with the intention of creating challenging traffic situations. For example, in hazard one (H1) a car parked next to the road activates their turn indicators and then cuts into the participant’s lane close in front of the ego vehicle, forcing the participant to either brake or veer. Latency, type of hazard, and scenarios (high- and low-speed) were all within participants’ variables. Objective simulator data collected included variables such as reaction time, post-encroachment time, speed variation, distance to hazard, collisions, etc. Subjective data was gathered through questionnaires between each of the balanced latency conditions to assess trust, perceived control, realism of scenarios, and workload etc. After the completed drive, participants were asked to rate in which order they believed they had been subjected to the different latencies. The participants were divided into two groups, experienced drivers and experienced gamers. Result The results of the simulator study show that for some of the hazards, but not all, there were significant differences in the latency conditions and there were interaction effects between participant groups and environment/speed. For example, in H1 the effect on the reaction time was significantly larger than the added latency. Overall, the experienced gamers drove with larger safety margins although they had not been told that the latency was varied. Speed, latency, and group characteristics were interacting in significant ways and affected performance measures. The subjective ratings show that participants experienced less control of the vehicle during higher latency conditions, even though they were not told in which order they had been subjected to the latency conditions. The separate tasks to perform were affected differently by the independent measures. The number of collisions was not affected by latency. Conclusion There seems to be a certain level of adaptivity among the participants, although they were not told that the latency varied between scenarios, and they could also not guess in which order they drove with the different conditions. In some situations, they drove with larger safety margins, especially experienced gamers in the high-speed scenario. Moreover, the subjective ratings show that participants felt less in control of the vehicle at higher latencies without being able to pinpoint what it was that affected their driving.",

Utilizing coherence method to quantify phase synchronization between EEG nodes, signal activities are converted into graph representations. After a complex-theoretic approach is conducted, intelligent brains emerge as more connected ones under resting state. Male brain, featuring lower connection strength and efficiency under resting state, exhibits the ability to boost up connectivity under mental workload. On the other hand, arithmetic success correlates with high resting state connectivity for all EEG bands but dominantly for gamma band, while unsuccessful brains yield greater beta band assortativity behavior. Theta band associated with unconscious actions apparently exhibits greater connection weights for mental activity compared to resting. Contributions of EEG bands to diagnosing differences in rest/task, gender and arithmetic success states are detailed within the study. We also spot out which connection patterns are related with mental progressing, outlining that intelligent brains yield less inter-frontal and more frontal to central and frontal to parieto-occipital connections.",

Therefore, doctors who diagnose rib fractures using CT may feel fatigued given the nature of the process, resulting in missed diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis is an effective means to reduce missed diagnosis. In this study, based on the difficulties associated with computer-aided rib fracture diagnosis, we conduct the following two tasks. Firstly, a data cleaning algorithm is proposed. Given the lack of publicly available CT rib fracture datasets, a CT rib fracture dataset is established using real clinical data collected from hospitals cleaned by this algorithm, which provides a good trade-off between human resource consumption and cleaning accuracy. Secondly, we propose a slice grouping and aggregation network (SGANet) model, which can classify the cases of rib fracture via three processes. Initially, several consecutive slices are merged into a group by three-dimensional (3D) convolution. Subsequently, the high-level features of each slice group are extracted by two-dimensional (2D) convolution to simulate the process through which doctors observe changes in the rib in the adjacent slice group with one slice as the center. Finally, the features of different groups are aggregated by 3D convolution for classification. The efficacy of the model is verified by a clinical dataset with the ground truth established by experienced doctors, and the results demonstrate that the missed diagnosis rate of rib fractures can be significantly reduced, albeit with a slight increase in the workload on doctors.

As we heard Prof. Nancy Leveson stating at last year's MKOPSC symposium, even with all components functioning, dysfunctional component interaction can still be a cause of mishap. Human factor expert, Prof. Erik Hollnagel, asserts it in even stronger terms: the Efficiency-Thoroughness Trade-off principle, or rather dilemma, contends that one can hardly do it perfectly well. Perfect thoroughness, certainly in complex situations, requires an amount of time with which efficiency will be in conflict. For improved situational awareness, sufficient resilience, and adequate risk control, we must adopt a top-down system approach. Hazard scenarios possible in the system, with all its entangled interactions of hardware, procedures, and humans shall be identified bottom-up and causal relations made clear. Fortunately, in recent years two potentially helpful tools have become available: Blended Hazid, a vastly improved, heavily computerized system approach making use of HazOp and FMEA, and Bayesian networks, a tool to model cause–effect structures allowing inclusion of uncertainty information. Bayesian networks as an infrastructure enable also the use of indicator values to relate the result of safety management effectiveness, which expresses itself as safety attitude of employees, competence, workload, and motivation, with their effects on error and failure probability. This paper will explain the directions these developments are advancing and the openings they provide for further process safety research and risk assessment, which when applied will result in improved process risk control.",

Hence, it is critical to study the nature of image annotation behaviors and process. This study investigated annotation tactics, transitions, strategies and their efficiency during the image annotation process. A total of 90 participants were recruited to annotate nine pictures in three emotional dimensions with three interactive annotation methods. Data collected from annotation logs and verbal protocols were analyzed by applying both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings of this study show that the cognitive process of human interpretation of images is rather complex, which reveals a probable bias in research involving image relevance feedback. Participants preferred applying scroll bar (Scr) and image comparison (Cim) tactics comparing with rating tactic (Val), and they did fewer fine tuning activities, which reflects the influence of perceptual level and users’ cognitive load during image annotation. Annotation tactic transition analysis showed that Cim was more likely to be adopted at the beginning of each phase, and the most remarkable transition was from Cim to Scr. By applying sequence analysis, the authors found 10 most commonly used sequences representing four types of annotation strategies, including Single tactic strategy, Tactic combination strategy, Fix mode strategy and Shift mode strategy. Furthermore, two patterns, “quarter decreasing” and “transition cost,” were identified based on time data, and both multiple tactics (e.g., the combination of Cim and Scr) and fine tuning activities were recognized as efficient tactic applications. Annotation patterns found in this study suggest more research needs to be done considering the need for multi-interactive methods and their influence. The findings of this study generated detailed and useful guidance for the interactive design in image annotation systems, including recommending efficient tactic applications in different phases, highlighting the most frequently applied tactics and transitions, and avoiding unnecessary transitions.",6

This article presented a systematic review to explore the key factors and influencing mechanisms that cause or affect the fluctuation of the DS level in the traffic situation, road conditions, and driving environment. Methods We reviewed the research on DS since 2013 and identified 61 peer-reviewed articles published. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to guide the literature search and quality assessments after categorizing and commenting on the studies, the experimental design methodologies, research scope, and research topics are further reviewed, and suggestions are put forward. Results The traffic density (n = 6), traffic behavior(n = 6), and traffic control (n = 4) are the main traffic situation factors; the road type (n = 14) and geometric design (n = 6) are the main road condition factors; weather, light, and landscape conditions (n = 6) are the external driving environment factors; and the air quality, in-vehicle devices (n = 7), and trust and takeover problems caused by human–machine interaction (n = 16) are the internal environment factors. These impacts on DS are reflected in the behavior of drivers, as well as their physiological and psychological states. Conclusion The future experiments must be conducted with multi-dimensional tasks, and multi-modal fusion methods; more abundant research is needed to explore the impacts of the high complexity of urban traffic and landscapes, the interactions between drivers and assisted driving systems, as well as the mixed driving mode of autonomous and manual vehicles on DS. Based on the different generation mechanisms of DS under different conditions, strategies, and suggestions for the alleviation of DS are proposed from the perspectives of driving assistance, traffic control, and landscape construction.",

This process largely comprises strategic planning (long-term) and master planning (mid-term) aspects. The portion that requires the most manual work of the planner is the load balancing in the master planning stage. The load balancing of master planning is an area where optimization studies using mixed integer programming, genetic algorithms, tabu search algorithms, and others have been actively conducted in the field of operational research. However, its practical application has not been successful due to the complexity and the curse of dimensionality, which is dependent on the manual work of the planner. Therefore, a new method that can facilitate the efficient action of optimal decisions is required, replacing conventional production planning methods based on the manual work of the planner. With the advent of the 4th industrial revolution in recent years, machine learning technology based on deep neural networks has been rapidly developing and applied to a wide range of engineering problems. This study introduces a methodology that can quickly improve the load balancing problem in shipyard master planning by using a deep neural network-based reinforcement learning algorithm among various machine learning techniques. Furthermore, we aim to verify the feasibility of the developed methodology using the ship block production data of an actual shipyard.",

The recursive feature elimination (RFE) and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) are combined and used for binary and multiclass feature selection. Besides typical binary LSSVM classifiers for two-class OFS assessment, two multiclass classifiers based on multiclass LSSVM-RFE and decision directed acyclic graph (DDAG) scheme are developed, one used for recognizing the high mental workload and fatigued state while the other for differentiating overloaded and base-line states from the normal states. Feature selection results have revealed that different dimensions of OFS can be characterized by specific set of psychophysiological features. Performance comparison studies show that reasonable high and stable classification accuracy of both classification frameworks can be achieved if the RFE procedure is properly implemented and utilized.",1

A study of sixteen clinical staff used Critical Decision Method to understand how work is coordinated and the constraints and criteria that are applied by the roles managing OoH care. The analysis identified ten types of coordination decision that, in turn, underpinned three types of adaptive behaviour – pre-emption, information augmentation and self-organisation – that were crucial for the effective performance in OoH care.

A computational model to estimate the VOR from head movement has been proposed. Previous research has shown that when humans perform mental tasks, the error between the measured and the estimated VOR (calculated with the mathematical model) increased. Previously, a computational model for estimating the VOR was proposed; this model, known as the 6DOF-SVC model considered several processes of self-motion estimation. Further, another study revealed that a parameter in this computational model representing self-motion estimation changed as a result of volition of the head movement. This result indicated that the activeness or passiveness of the head movement influenced the outcome. However, the relationship between added mental tasks and the model self-motion estimation parameter has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in this study, an experiment to investigate the effect of mental tasks on the modeling error and the model parameter was implemented. Specifically, movements of the eye and head were measured when participants were exposed to a pitching vibration with and without a mental task to perform. The experimental results showed that the modeling error increased and the model self-motion estimation parameter decreased with the addition of a mental task. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the model parameter and the VOR gain, which was calculated from the peak eye and head angular velocities.",19

Specifically, the user of a gaze-controlled interface must suppress looking for its own sake, the so-called “Midas touch” problem. In a pre-registered study (https://osf.io/2mak4), we tested whether gaze-typing performance depends on executive control and whether learning-dependent plasticity leads to improved executive control as measured using the antisaccade task. Forty-two university students were recruited as participants. After five 30-min training sessions, we found shorter antisaccade latencies in a gaze-control compared to a mouse-control group, and similar error-rates.

Various IoT paradigms like the Internet of Vehicle Things (IoVT) and the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) create massive volumes of data every day which consume a lot of bandwidth and storage. However, to process such large volumes of data, the existing cloud computing platforms offer limited resources due to their distance from IoT devices. Consequently, cloud-computing systems produce intolerable latency problems for latency-sensitive real-time applications. Therefore, a new paradigm called fog computing makes use of computing nodes in the form of mobile devices, which utilize and process the real-time IoT devices data in orders of milliseconds. This paper proposes workload-aware efficient resource allocation and load balancing in the fog-computing environment for the IoHT. The proposed algorithmic framework consists of the following components: task sequencing, dynamic resource allocation, and load balancing. We consider electrocardiography (ECG) sensors for patient's critical tasks to achieve maximum load balancing among fog nodes and to measure the performance of end-to-end delay, energy, network consumption and average throughput. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated using the iFogSim tool, and results with the existing approach have been conducted.

In view of the dynamic nature of data centers, we propose a stochastic model based on Queueing theory to capture the main characteristics. Solving this model, we notice that there exists a tradeoff between the energy consumption and performance. We hereby develop a BFGS based algorithm to optimize the tradeoff by searching for the optimal system parameter values for the data center operators to “right-size” the data centers.

This is particularly relevant for multi-camera systems employed for continuous and/or long term monitoring of some dimensional process, e.g. dimensional checks of the same manufactured component as it comes off the production line. In most of these cases, camera calibration is updated regularly to ensure optimal accuracy. Specifically, the use of photogrammetric systems requires the knowledge of both internal and external camera parameters estimated by calibration. Constancy of both sets is required during use. Internal parameters, pertaining to camera-specific properties, require stability over the operational lifespan of the system, while external parameters, concerning location and orientation, may change between calibrations. A diagnostic method for internal parameters based on multivariate control charts is proposed. The purpose of this method is to provide a comprehensive stability control over all the performed calibrations, especially for those systems used for regular monitoring of production lines. By integrating chart building into calibration software, no additional steps are added to the operator's workload for the calibration process.

However, in historical long duration missions, occurrences of monotony were, indeed, reported anecdotally by crew. Of the effective countermeasures that appear to be at hand, many rely on visual or logistical proximity to the Earth, and are not feasible in the remote context of an extended deep space mission scenario. There, particularly in- and outbound cruising stages would be characterised by longer, comparably uneventful periods of low workload, coupled with confinement and unchanging vehicle surroundings. While the challenge of monotony has been pointed out as an exploration-related research area, it has received less explicit attention from a habitation design perspective than other human behaviour and performance issues. The paper addresses this gap through a literature review of the theory and application of design-based mitigation strategies. It outlines models of emergence of monotony, situates the phenomenon in a remote mission context as a problem of sensory, social and spatio-temporal isolation, and discusses proposed countermeasures related to habitability. The scope of the literature is extended to primary sources in the form of a qualitative review of six onboard diaries from orbital and simulator missions, highlighting a range of habitat-related design themes.

The concept of dynamic function allocation (DFA) was suggested to resolve these disadvantages by changing the levels of human/machine's controls over system functions. Despite the importance of function allocation, there are limited methods explicitly working out the challenges of DFA in real-world applications. In order to improve system reliability and reduce ‘out-of-the-loop’ problems, the present study focuses on the determination of the reallocation times known as the trigger mechanism and the way of reallocating as the allocation strategy. To this end, the prediction of agent reliability is an essential step. To handle uncertainty arising from the subjectivity of analysis and lack of data, the Bayesian network is used to predict system performance. As a case study, the interaction of humans with a distributed control system used in a gas power plant is considered. By applying the proposed DFA method, human situation awareness and system reliability would be improved by approximately 30%, specifically under time pressure, and inappropriate work environment.

Limited energy storage of sensor nodes (SNs) and the possibility of packet loss contribute to fast energy consumption and unstable networks, respectively. UAVs serve as relay nodes and data sinks, addressing these issues by temporarily storing data to reduce SN workload and establishing mobile nodes for network stability. We propose two innovations based on previous work: 1) We introduce a multi-layer wireless network architecture, categorizing UAVs into two layers based on their functions including data collection and data processing. This enhances task parallelization, bridging performance gaps among multiple UAVs; 2) We overcome the mobility limitation of SNs, considering their real-time movement in the network. Through deep reinforcement learning, UAVs learn to cooperatively locate moving SNs. This accounts for the inevitable mobility of livestock in the industry. Additionally, we simulate the environment and compare our approach to traditional methods, evaluating metrics such as collected data per timestep (DCPS), energy consumed per timestep (ECPS), and network stability (NS). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches, achieving a data collecting gain of 4.84% and 8.20% compared to the methods without considering SN mobility or the multi-layer characteristics of WSNs, respectively. Under energy consumption limits, our method yields energy savings of 3.00% and 1.35% respectively.

However, the unlabeled samples are easy to obtain. Active learning (AL) technology can be used to resolve the labeling problem. Among numerous kinds of AL algorithms, the one that focuses on labeling the unlabeled samples within the margin band of SVM is an effective way to decrease manual labeling workload. AL needs human involvement, but the time and energy which human can provide is often limited. Therefore, there is a big restriction for sample labeling based on the AL technology. To this end, the motivation of this work is to do studies on the processing after the AL process. For the AL algorithm which focuses on exploring the unlabeled samples within the margin band of SVM, after it stops, we aim for investigating whether such unlabeled samples can continue to be explored by semi-supervised learning (SSL) or not. To design such SSL algorithm, one of the challenges is how to figure out unlabeled samples’ confidence, and then select the ones with high confidence. In this work, we proposed 3 criterions to determine confidence, i.e. 1) the smoothness assumption; 2) the explored positive samples and the explored negative samples should be similar to the labeled positive samples and the labeled negative samples as much as possible, respectively; 3) the explored positive samples and the explored negative samples should be different from the labeled negative samples and the labeled positive samples as much as possible, respectively. Based on these 3 criterions, a SSL algorithm—SSL_3C was proposed in this work. Furthermore, we applied SSL_3C to audio event classification field, and did experiments on two public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SSL_3C can improve the classification performance after the AL process effectively. The selected unlabeled samples are not only of high confidence, but also very informative. Moreover, SSL_3C is not sensitive to the size of labeled and unlabeled training set. The contributions of this work lie in two aspects: first, for the unlabeled samples within the margin band of SVM, we have proposed an effective SSL algorithm to explore them; second, we innovatively proposed 3 criterions to determine unlabeled samples’ confidence. Based on these 3 criterions, the explored unlabeled samples are not only of high confidence, but also very informative. Since labeling problem exists in many classification fields, and SSL_3C can effectively decrease manual labeling workload, then the proposed SSL_3C should find widespread applications in many other fields.",

Distributed open-source frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark facilitate efficient link prediction especially in large-scale social networks. The frameworks provide different kinds of tunable properties for users to manually configure the parameters for the applications. However, manual configurations are open to performance issues when the applications start scaling tremendously, which are hard to set up and are exposed to human errors. This paper proposes a novel Self-Configured Framework (SCF) to provide an autonomous feature in Spark that predicts and sets the best configuration instantly before the application execution using the XGBoost classifier. The framework with a self-configuration setting demonstrates a 40% reduction in prediction time as well as a balanced resource consumption that makes full use of resources, especially for limited number and size of clusters. The presented framework establishes its efficiency for link prediction in large-scale social networks by automatically configuring the best configuration suitable for a specific application given the varying dataset size of the Twitter social network, workload, and cluster specification.",

In this process, the assembly sequence of vehicles is set several days prior to production, and communicated to the suppliers. The committed sequence is essential for efficient operations both at the original equipment manufacturer and its suppliers. In practice, however, sequence stability is insufficient. Short-term disruptions, such as quality problems and missing parts, put the sequence at risk. If a disruption occurs, the affected vehicle is removed from the sequence. The resulting gap is closed by bringing the succeeding vehicles forward. Such sequence alterations, however, cause workload changes and potentially work overloads at the assembly stations. As a remedial measure, additional sequence alterations are necessary, which further disturb material supply. Robustness against short-term sequence alterations is currently a key objective of automotive manufacturers. In this paper, we propose a sequencing approach that includes the vehicles’ failure probabilities in order to generate robust sequences. Robust sequences are sequences that can be operated without modifications, even when vehicles fail. We develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that optimally solves small-sized instances. For large-sized instances, we design a sampling-based adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. The superiority of our approach is validated in a simulation study using real-world data from a major European manufacturer. We find reductions in the expected work overloads of 72% and 80%, compared to the industry solution, and compared to an approach taken from literature which does not take failures into account.",3

The cores can operate with different precisions and are designed to be integrated in a heterogeneous CPU-FPGA system for Edge AI applications. The methodology involves quantization-sparsity aware training and it is applied to a case study consisting of human activity classification. We initially investigate the effects of quantization and sparsity on the accuracy of neural networks with convolution, dense and recurrent layers observing better tolerance to pruning when recurrent layers are present. Then, we propose the hardware accelerators that can switch precision at run-time and work with any matrix size up to a maximum configured at compile time. We compare the performance of these accelerators at different levels of precision and sparsity levels and create a performance model to enable workload balancing. The results show that the proposed sparse matrix multipliers can outperform dense multipliers when sparsity levels are higher than 70% and the improvements are more evident when higher precision arithmetic or structural pruning is used. Additionally, sparsity levels as high as 99% can maintain the level of accuracy required in the network especially when recurrent layers are deployed. Overall, the balance between sparse and dense performance depends on matrix shape, precision, structural pruning and sparsity levels and performance modelling can be used to balance concurrent execution in a heterogeneous configuration.",

Brush cytology for counting Argyrophilic Nucleolar Organizer Regions (AgNORs) can help early mouth cancer detection, lowering patient mortality. However, the manual counting of AgNORs still in use today is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. The goal of our work is to address these shortcomings by proposing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to automatically segment individual nuclei and AgNORs in microscope slide images and count the number of AgNORs within each nucleus. Methods We systematically defined, trained and tested 102 CNNs in the search for a high-performing solution. This included the evaluation of 51 network architectures combining 17 encoders with 3 decoders and 2 loss functions. These CNNs were trained and evaluated on a new AgNOR-stained image dataset of epithelial cells from oral mucosa containing 1,171 images from 48 patients, with ground truth annotated by specialists. The annotations were greatly facilitated by a semi-automatic procedure developed in our project. Overlapping nuclei, which tend to hide AgNORs, thus affecting their true count, were discarded using an automatic solution also developed in our project. Besides the evaluation on the test dataset, the robustness of the best performing model was evaluated against the results produced by a group of human experts on a second dataset. Results The best performing CNN model on the test dataset consisted of a DenseNet-169 + LinkNet with Focal Loss (DenseNet-169 as encoder and LinkNet as decoder). It obtained a Dice score of 0.90 and intersection over union (IoU) of 0.84. The counting of nuclei and AgNORs achieved precision and recall of 0.94 and 0.90 for nuclei, and 0.82 and 0.74 for AgNORs, respectively. Our solution achieved a performance similar to human experts on a set of 291 images from 6 new patients, obtaining Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 for nuclei and 0.81 for AgNORs with 95% confidence intervals of [0.89, 0.93] and [0.77, 0.84], respectively, and p-values < 0.001, confirming its statistical significance. Our AgNOR-stained image dataset is the most diverse publicly available AgNOR-stained image dataset in terms of number of patients and the first for oral cells. Conclusions CNN-based joint segmentation and quantification of nuclei and NORs in AgNOR-stained images achieves expert-like performance levels, while being orders of magnitude faster than the later. Our solution demonstrated this by showing strong agreement with the results produced by a group of specialists, highlighting its potential to accelerate diagnostic workflows. Our trained model, code, and dataset are available and can stimulate new research in early oral cancer detection.",

This problem is modelled in a bi-objective framework that minimises the number of maintenance personnel while maximising their productivity levels. Inputs into the optimisation model include monthly and routine maintenance periods, volume of production, contingency maintenance time, use factor and priority factor among others. The model has been validated with real-life detergent factory data, demonstrating its potential usefulness. A principal novelty of the model is the inclusion of use factor, which captures how often maintenance technicians are busy on the job with respect to assigned tasks, including unanticipated high maintenance workload. The model has been solved using a branch and bound algorithm. The impact of workforce structure and workers’ salaries on model’s performance has been studied and sensitivity analysis carried out to investigate the changes to the optimal solution as a result of changes in the input data. The results show a reduction in the number of maintenance workforce personnel in comparing values with and without use factor in the model. The model’s ability to obtain global optimal result depends on the value of the minimum routine maintenance time within each maintenance section. Also, the model is shown to be sensitive to priority factor, which captures the appropriate ratio of full- and part-time workers under the same category. The model provides both an easy-to-use practical tool for maintenance managers and supervisors as well as a scientific tool for determining optimal maintenance workforce size for a manufacturing plant.",

The results show that the screening system with integration of RPA reduces the average handling time per user by 75%. The overall satisfaction score of the application is 8.10 out of 10. The machine learning module helps in notifying clinicians when the preliminary diagnosis results in severe conditions, allowing timely treatment. Integration of RPA and ML can assist clinicians and reduce the workload of medical staff significantly.

Agent timing significantly influenced the role assumed by the human within the team. Further, agent timing changed system performance by approximately 40% within the experimental conditions. Results indicate that an artificial agent’s timing can be varied as a function of the task demands placed upon the human-agent team to maintain an appropriate level of human activity and engagement.

The first one minimizes the total consumed energy by a set of servers by providing the optimal assignment of computing tasks over the time periods, while the second one minimizes both the CO2 emissions and the cost of a grid energy mix. To prove the applicability of the proposed framework, a Blockchain prototype is implemented to simulate an IoT-based supply chain of hazardous materials.

The system is designed to utilize multiple Kinects, and the data model conveys and manages data from these devices to calibrate an algorithm that can be used to create a digital human model. Through this system, it is possible to easily generate a digital human model accurately, inexpensively, and efficiently. The developed digital human modeling automation system is verified using four scenarios, and the results, limitations, and development plan of the study are described.",

However, given the frequency of these minor disruptions, the extent of their impact on operations needs to be scoped. In a human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation, four TRACON controllers worked arrival traffic to Phoenix airport (PHX), aided by a schedule and controller sequencing and spacing tools. In approximately two-thirds of the runs, either one or two disrupting events that were local or global in nature, were set in motion. Controllers were asked to manage the disruptions and bring the traffic back onto the schedule. The research questions were exploratory: to observe the impact of the disruption, watch how controllers solved these problems and whether the controller tools assisted them. Global events were observed to have a greater impact on TRACON operations than local events as they led to a greater mean path length flown by aircraft through the TRACON and, although reported workload levels remained manageable overall global events created higher reported loads. Controller strategies for resolving events followed a similar pattern: with controllers often solving local problems with speed and moving to using vectors more often during global events. Controllers used their tools in a similar manner to those observed in nominal-operations studies, with the slot marker being the preferred aid regardless of the event. However, due to the range of factors influencing the event, e.g., environmental conditions, aircraft density in the TRACON, etc., sometimes the plan required revision and occasionally events had a wide-reaching effect.",

Adjustable autonomous agents operate according to a spectrum of autonomy states. The autonomy states are dynamically adjusted to improve the agents’ performance and avoid autonomy surprises. For instance, the agents need to be guided or improvise when they encounter unplanned events. In this paper, we propose an Adjustable Autonomy Management (AAM) module for multi-agent systems. We integrate the AAM module within a BDI agent’s architecture to form an adjustable autonomous agent. The AAM module enables the agent to internally adjust its autonomy and handles external autonomy adjustments. We apply the agents in an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system. We test the UAV in a dynamic environment via experimenting aerial surveillance missions. The test results show that the agent-based UAV system successfully operates in the dynamic environment and performs the aerial surveillance missions. Subsequently, the AAM module is able to manage agents’ autonomy, reduce human workload and reduce adjustable autonomy disturbance.",

Nowadays, there are many non-invasive ways to monitor the health status of induction motors, including sensors to measure temperature, magnetic field, vibration, current, and power. However, installing these sensors may not be a simple task since intrusive procedures such as engine disassembling, wire separation, and engine interruption are commonly observed. Thus, we propose MUCLA (Multiphase Clamp and Tracking - patent pending) as a new device and methodology for monitoring motor degradation by analyzing its stator current. MUCLA introduces a non-invasive current sensors array on a proposed clamp in the hardware perspective, while a spectral tracking methodology refers to our novelty in the software viewpoint. For end-users, the main MUCLA contribution relies on the combination of the simplicity of installation and the possibility of using the proposed device even when considering Variable-Frequency Drive powered engines. The results obtained with both simulation and practical tests show encouraging results over different input workloads and emulated degradation. Compared to the current initiatives, we can classify MUCLA as a better solution for industrial plants in terms of installation time, installation complexity, and cost.",3

However, several positioning errors occur during or after the placement of such devices (Endotracheal tubes mispositioned in 10 to 20% of intubations). In addition, the delay of X-ray diagnosis after surgery can cause serious complications. Such delays are caused by the hospitals' resourcelessness or due to workload in intensive care units. The X-rays images availability (Most used diagnosis modality in intensive care units, 40% to 50%) and the presence of tubes in those images (lines are present on 33% of X-ray images) present a fertile ground to feed DCNNs training on tube error detection tasks and reduce complications. However, training and tuning one DCNN learner to resolve tube detection is time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a custom stacked generalization framework to combine wake learners with a proposed meta learner neural network architecture to resolve tube error detection tasks. The proposed framework AUC (93.84%) outperforms other related work methods with the input size of (380pixel*380pixel). Furthermore, we demonstrated the sensibility of stacked generalization to the number of base learners. Moreover, we validated the utility of input cross-validation used to form level1-metadata for the stacked generalization. Our framework can be adapted to be integrated with a CAD (computer aid decision system) for tubes error detection. The CAD can detect errors immediately after patient screening and notify radiologists to prioritize diagnosis of cases with positioning errors to adjust tubes and reduce risks significantly.",

The experimental design began with a relaxation period, 40 questions (congruent, then incongruent) without a timer, a rest period followed by another two rounds of questions, but under increased time pressure. Measures such as workload and engagement showed responses consistent with what is expected for Stroop tests.

A central position in the network with frequent and regular flights with hub nodes can boost air traffic by providing better accessibility, resulting in more efficient use of airport resources. However, this relationship has been largely ignored in the literature. Using data from the Turkish airport industry, this paper proposed a weight-restricted Network Data Envelopment Analysis model, which considers network centrality measures as the cornerstone intermediates that establish the link between airport resources and the traffic volume handled. In the first stage, called networkability, assets such as runways, terminals, aprons, and special purpose vehicles, and exogenous factors including population, socio-economic development, and tourist arrivals are used to accomplish the network integration with other airports, as measured by degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. In the second stage, called traffic generation, this network integration allows for aircraft movements and workload unit to be handled. Criteria weights of model variables were calculated using Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation. The main findings indicate that 1) the weight-restriction procedure improved the robustness of Network DEA, 2) the proposed two-stage structure reveals whether performance losses are due to networkability or traffic generation capabilities and helps to identify the right policies for performance improvement, 3) the Turkish airports generally suffer from the inability to establish connections in the domestic network, 4) the pandemic has significantly improved the domestic networkability of airports due to mandatory direct flights while devastating the traffic generation capability, 5) low betweenness centrality is the main reason for weak networkability, and 6) good networkability may not ensure air traffic generation.",

A self-designed quarter-arc guiding track device was especially applied in this system, and thus both the door operating force as well as the door operating torque was simultaneously and effectively measured. Then, a series of experiments in the laboratory were carried out to determine the door required operating torque (ROT). The results showed that as the door closer was utilized, the ROT of the door increased significantly. There were two characteristic measuring signals, the initial operating torque (IOT) and the ROT existed individually. The difference of these two toques became greater as a lower door opening speed and a bigger size of door closer was applied. The results showed that the application of the door closer would increase users' workload so as to make the door operate intermittently especially for people with poor individual capability. Thus, suggestions of the application of a door closer were further given in accomplishing a door with universal design. Relevance to industry An appropriate operating force measuring system and methods for the hinged door were provided here. According to the measuring signals, the workload burden level of the door operation could be effectively evaluated. Moreover, the door opening capability (DOC) score defined by the ratio of the ROT to the door-opened time was proved to be effectively utilized as the indicator of the required individual capability for users.",

Since cloud computing relies on the facilities like network infrastructures and cloud servers, the cloud service can be easily hampered by the limitation of these facilities in many cases. Therefore, researchers proposed the concept of device-to-device offloading to offload workload to nearby devices, without going through other facilities. Most existing works on device-to-device offloading aim to minimize the execution time of tasks or minimize the energy consumption. These works assume devices can be connected for a long time, but they neglect the fact that the connections among mobile devices are usually intermittent and even opportunistic, which may render the failure of task offloading. In this paper, we propose a new approach, PeerCloud, that aims to improve the success ratio of task offloading. Specifically, since mobile devices are carried by human beings, we study the social relationship between the device carriers and discover the hidden regularity in their contact patterns, in order to predict the likelihood of node departure. Optimization problems are then formalized to maximize the success ratio of task offloading within tasks’ time constraints. Experimental results based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PeerCloud outperforms existing approaches by significantly improving the success ratio.",

The idea of work-life balance means, that a human’s life outside of the job is equally important to their work life and that the amount of time spent working should be evenly divided by the amount of time spent doing things, such as occupied hours with friends and family, exercising, and other similar ventures. Amongst other challenges, attaining satisfaction and balance is a key challenge. Aim: The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of men's and women's work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the theoretical framework of which is the work-life balance theory, which asserts that individuals should have an equitable distribution of time and energy between their work and personal life domains. The theory emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance to promote overall well-being and satisfaction Methodology: The current study is descriptive, empirical, and quantitative. The data were collected through a questionnaire administered to 200 working men and women employees. The latest PLS method was also used to analyse the obtained data. Results: The findings reveal that women experience more workload than men because of their personal involvement in their jobs through the period of working from home. Notably, there were no gender variances in the connection between work interruptions and personal life. It was found that the organization could help to reduce work interference with personal life and that by doing so, employees’ work-life unevenness could be reduced to some level. Practical and Social Implication: Given the possibility of employees experiencing psychological stress, a company could consider arranging for a trained professional to provide online counselling. Such a strategic initiative by a company during stressful times could motivate employees. The environment may also aid employees in maintaining their psychological welfare Conclusion: Many prior studies have examined the nature of WLB and the psychological and behavioural disorders that employees face. This study aimed to investigate the work-life balance in which employees were mandated to work from home during the -19 pandemic.",

Compared to manual driving, drivers can engage in tasks that are difficult to interrupt and of higher demand, the consequences can be a reduced perception of, and an impaired reaction to, warnings. In this study we compared three in-vehicle warnings (auditory, tactile, and auditory-tactile) which were presented during three highly attention capturing tasks (visual, auditory, and tactile) while the user was engaged in a self-driving car scenario, culminating in an emergency brake event where the warning was presented. The novel addition for this paper was that three set paced, attention capturing tasks, as well the three warnings were all designed in a pilot study to have comparable workload and noticeability. This enabled a direct comparison of human performance to be made between each of the attention capturing tasks, which are designed to occupy only one specific modality (auditory, visual or haptic), but remain similar in overall task demand. Results from the study showed reaction times to the tactile warning (for the emergency braking event) were significantly slower compared to the auditory and auditory-tactile (aka multimodal or multisensory) warning. Despite the similar reaction times between the in-vehicle auditory warning and the multimodal warning, the multimodal warning led to a reduced number of missed warnings and fewer false responses. However, the auditory and auditory-tactile warnings were rated significantly more startling than the tactile alone. Our results extend the literature regarding the performance benefits of multimodal warnings by comparing them with in-vehicle auditory warnings in an autonomous driving context. The set-pace attention capturing tasks in this study would be of interest to other researchers to evaluate the interaction in an automated driving context, particularly with hard to interrupt and attention capturing tasks.",

Our objective was to develop an Artificially Intelligent (AI) chatbot to respond to caregiver’s immunization-related queries in Pakistan and investigate its feasibility and acceptability in a low-resource, low-literacy setting. Methods We developed Bablibot (Babybot), a local language immunization chatbot, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies with Human in the Loop feature. We evaluated the bot through a sequential mixed-methods study. We enrolled caregivers visiting the 12 selected immunization centers for routine childhood vaccines. Additional caregivers were reached through targeted text message communication. We assessed Bablibot’s feasibility and acceptability by tracking user engagement and technological metrics, and through thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with 20 caregivers. Findings Between March 9, 2020, and April 15, 2021, 2,202 caregivers were enrolled in the study, of which, 677 (30.7%) interacted with Bablibot (users). Bablibot responded to 1,877 messages through 874 conversations. Conversation topics included vaccination due dates (32.4%; 283/874), side-effect management (15.7%;137/874), or delaying vaccination due to child’s illness or COVID-lockdown (16.8%;147/874). Over 90% (277/307) of responses to text-based exit surveys indicated satisfaction with Bablibot. Qualitative analysis showed caregivers appreciated Bablibot’s usefulness and provided feedback for further improvement of the system. Conclusion Our results demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of local-language NLP chatbots in providing real-time immunization information in low-resource settings. Text-based chatbots canminimize the workload on helpline operators, in addition to instantaneously resolving caregiver queries that otherwise lead to delay or default.",

Surgical instruments are inserted through a small incision to access the kidney and remove the calculi. Surgeons who have less experience with the procedure manifest significantly higher rates of complications due to the procedure’s steep learning curve. This issue is further exacerbated by a lack of training opportunities in clinical settings. This paper introduces a teleoperative framework that can provide training to surgeons as well as assistance during procedures, based on two main components. Firstly, a type of constrained inverse kinematics that decouples the tooltip position from its orientation using a remote centre of motion, and incorporates the joint limits analytically. This reduces the workload of the procedure by having the surgeon control only the tooltip position rather than the position and the orientation while preventing the inverse kinematics from returning joint angles outside of the robot’s abilities. This kinematic framework also allows a three-degrees-of-freedom haptic device to control a six-degrees-of-freedom manipulator. Secondly, haptic feedback is provided to help guide and teach the surgeon during the procedure. Haptic feedback allows the surgeon to remain in full control during the procedure while still receiving haptic cues and assistance. Experimental results indicate that the haptic cues improved user’s accuracy, and they had shorter and smoother paths. This leads to a shorter procedure time overall. The results also indicate that the haptic assistance helped teach users the ideal trajectory of the procedure and that users who were taught with haptic feedback performed better than those who never experienced any haptic feedback.",

In this research, evaluation of an assistance system was performed with a driving simulator. The experimental results revealed that the automation level of the mutual assistance system heavily changed the driver's attitude. The semi-automatic system was more effective than the fully automatic system for making positive attitude changes. In addition, the semi-automatic system was the most effective for decreasing the driver collision rate.

The Dijkstra algorithm produces a different permutation of activities alongside each selected path that should be examined in optimization function using the type-2 fuzzy simplex algorithm. This method generates the best permutation using run-time optimization which significantly satisfies lower project completion time inside the project cost minimization. Also, the method proposed a resource workload for both tactical and operational levels of planning. The presented approach is conducted by the gas-related industry project and a case on satellite design of the aerospace industry on 3 different Resource/Process/Environment strategies. The results convey the defined method has a better performance compared to type-1 fuzzy for covering the largest uncertainty domain. This method could be considered in every engineering project management.",

Exploiting the value of these time series is conductive to workload balancing and production optimization. Unfortunately, knowledge obtained from the mining process turns out to be insufficient for use due to widespread anomalies, indicating machine breakdown, sensor failure or working status shifts. To tackle this problem, we propose a constraint hypergraph-based method, combining multiple constraints for anomaly detection. We develop strategies for adaptive determinative anomaly detection and anomaly pattern mining. We also investigate the problem of Anomaly Pattern Matching, prove its NP-completeness, and propose algorithms to obtain its global and local optimum. Finally, we demonstrate our approach with three real world datasets from a real powerplant, a chemical production pipeline and a hydraulic system. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively and efficiently work under different circumstances.",

Design/methodology/approach The researcher followed a narrative approach by discussing previous research regarding the insufficient pre-service training beginning teachers received and the lack of a structured induction programme in the South African context. Findings Research has shown that South African beginning teachers have faced similar difficulties as beginning teachers worldwide, but South African beginning teachers are not subjected to formal induction programmes. While the South African Department of Basic Education offered guidelines for the beginning teacher orientation programme, there is almost no evidence in the literature that schools follow such guidelines. Research limitations/implications The implications of this paper give other researchers in this field a broader perspective on how the new multimodal induction model can make a measurable contribution to the school, the mentor, the beginning teacher and, most importantly, the learner.

The uncertainty about the VM type (attacker, target or neutral) exacerbates the difficulty of the problem. However, existing methods, particularly VM placement strategies, fail to capture the risk of significant losses. The measures of risk have a crucial role in coping with the losses that might be incurred by the involved parties in finance or the insurance industry. In this paper, we introduce the notion of risk to the co-location resistant VM placement strategies. We develop a novel framework that assesses the co-location attack risk of an assignment returned by a specific VM placement strategy. A thorough analysis of multiple existing VM placement algorithms highlights the significance of incorporating this measure as it reveals a discernible correlation pattern with respect to co-location attack coverage and resource consumption. Based on these findings, we propose a new Approximate Co-Location Resistant Placement Strategy with Risk Constraints (ACLRPS-RC) to protect the involved parties from overwhelming security losses. The simulations on CloudSim using real workloads show the ability of the new strategy to meet a given level of risk while maintaining an adequate number of used servers.",

Despite research conducted in working contexts has found that trait authenticity is related to people's work engagement, it is not clear if this association may be mediated by other variables. Objective Framing trait authenticity within the job demands-resources model, we hypothesized that trait authenticity allows the release of human full potential in terms of personal resources that, in turn, promote work engagement, especially in highly challenging work settings, such as educational ones. Method We administered a self-report questionnaire composed of several measurement scales to 446 teachers working in kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools. Results and conclusions A moderated mediation analysis revealed that trait authenticity can promote teachers’ emergence of personal resources, which in turn enhances their work engagement. The study highlights that the role of trait authenticity and personal resources on work engagement acquires a particular salience when teachers face high (vs. low) challenge job demands (i.e., workload), that is when this reservoir of potential is needed the most. Résumé Introduction L’authenticité de trait a été définie comme une différence individuelle dispositionnelle. Elle se réfère à l’expérience de vivre en accord avec le vrai Soi. Bien que les recherches aient montré que, dans les contextes de travail, l’authenticité des traits est liée à l’engagement des personnes au travail, mais il n’est pas clair si cette association peut être médiée par d’autres variables. Objectif En encadrant l’authenticité des traits de caractère dans le modèle exigences professionnelles-ressources, nous avons émis l’hypothèse que l’authenticité des traits de caractère permet la libération du plein potentiel humain en termes de ressources personnelles qui, à leur tour, favorisent l’engagement au travail, en particulier dans les environnements de travail très exigeants, tels que les environnements éducatifs.

Vehicles’ workload is usually summarized by means of standard labels, called duties. Fleet managers exploit duties to optimize productivity, minimize costs, show compliance with industrial regulations, and prevent vehicle misuses and failures. Duty levels are commonly manually enforced by manufacturers separately for each vehicle. However, since vehicles’ usage levels may fluctuate from light to heavy with variable periodicity, duty level assignment requires periodic customization. This paper addresses the problem of automatically defining the current duties of industrial vehicles and their corresponding levels by means of machine learning techniques applied to CAN bus data. In the context of industrial vehicle management, a key challenge is the lack of annotated data due to the following reasons: (1) The high variability in vehicles’ models and types makes the annotation process extremely labor-intensive. (2) Duty levels depend on the current usage context thus requiring periodic refinements. To tackle these issues, we propose a new two-stage method based on segment-wise clustering of per-vehicle CAN bus signals followed by a point-wise duty level assignment applied to the samples of each segment. Segments of per-vehicle CAN bus signals are first grouped together to discover similar vehicle usage profiles. Then, separately for each group we automatically derive the point-wise duty levels characterizing each usage profile. The proposed methodology is unsupervised, i.e., it does not require the availability of any annotated data, and is portable to arbitrary vehicles and context of usage without the need of human intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on CAN bus data acquired from real vehicles of different types and models. The empirical evidence confirms its applicability to real industrial scenarios.",

While this phenomenon has been widely investigated in animal models, human studies are lacking due to shortage of donors’ arteries. This work aimed to characterise the effect of ageing on the mechanical properties of the human aortic wall in the circumferential direction. N = 127 thoracic aortic rings (age 18–81 years) were subjected to circumferential tensile testing. The tangential elastic modulus (Kθθθθ) was calculated at pressure-equivalent stresses ranging 60–100 mmHg. Further, the mechanical data were fitted using the Holzpafel-Gasser-Ogden hyperelastic strain energy function (HGO-SEF), modelling the superimposed response of an isotropic matrix (elastin) reinforced by collagen fibres. Kθθθθ increased with age across at all considered pressures (p < 0.001), although more strongly at higher pressures. Indeed, the slope of the linear Kθθθθ-pressure relationship increased by 300% from donors <30 to ≥70 years (4.72± 2.95 to 19.06± 6.82 kPa/mmHg, p < 0.001). The HGO-SEF elastin stiffness-like parameter dropped by 31% between 30 and 40 years (p < 0.05) with non-significant changes thereafter. Conversely, changes in HGO-SEF collagen parameters were observed later at age>60 years, with the exponential constant increasing by ∼20–50 times in the investigated age range (p < 0.001). The results provided evidence that the human thoracic aorta undergoes stiffening during its life-course. Constitutive modelling suggested that these changes in arterial mechanics are related to the different degeneration time-courses of elastin and collagen; likely due to considerable fragmentation of elastin first, with the load bearing shifting from the compliant elastin to the stiffer collagen fibres. This process leads to a gradual impairment of the aortic elastic function with age.",

A computer-aided screening system can automatically find out if the scanned whole-slide images (WSI) with cervical cells are classified as “abnormal” or “normal”, and then alert pathologists. It can significantly reduce the workload for human experts, and is therefore highly demanded in clinical practice. Most of the screening methods are based on automatic cervical cell detection and classification, but the accuracy is generally limited due to the high variation of cell appearance and lacking context information from the surroundings. Here we propose a novel and hierarchical framework for automatic cervical smear screening aiming at the robust performance of case-level diagnosis and finding suspected “abnormal” cells. Our framework consists of three stages. We commence by extracting a large number of pathology images from the scanned WSIs, and implementing abnormal cell detection to each pathology image. Then, we feed the detected “abnormal” cells with corresponding confidence into our novel classification model for a comprehensive analysis of the extracted pathology images. Finally, we summarize the classification outputs of all extracted images, and determine the overall screening result for the target case. Experiments show that our three-stage hierarchical method can effectively suppress the errors from cell-level detection, and provide an effective and robust way for cervical abnormality screening.",

We aimed to investigate the effect of different types of training programmes about the functioning of automated driving on drivers’ takeover performance during real driving. Fifty-two participants were split into three groups for training sessions: paper (short notice), video (3-minute tutorial) and practice (short drive). After the training, participants experienced automated driving and both urgent and non-urgent requests to intervene in a Wizard-of-Oz vehicle on public roads. Participants’ takeover time, visual behaviour, mental workload, and flow levels during the requests to intervene were assessed. Our results indicated that in urgent circumstances, participants’ takeover response times were faster in the practice training condition compared to the other training conditions. Nevertheless, the practice training session did not present any other positive effect on drivers’ visual behaviour. This could indicate that prior training, particularly when reinforcing drivers' motor skills, improved their takeover response time at the latest motor stages rather than in the early sensory states. In addition, the analysis of in-vehicle videos revealed that participants’ attention was captured in the first place by the in-vehicle human-machine interface during the urgent request to intervene. This highlights the importance for designers to display information on the HMI in an appropriate way to optimise drivers’ situation awareness in critical situations.",

Methods The same therapy is performed by 52 healthy subjects in two totally different graphic environments, one rich in details and visual stimuli, and its schematic version focusing just in the target graphic elements. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, related to emotional state, is analyzed through the capture and processing of associated physiological signals. The SAM test is used to assess the subjective perception of the participants in order to establish a relationship with the calculated physiological parameters. Results Indexes calculated from the ANS physiological signals show significant differences between the basal state and those corresponding to the performance of the therapies but do not allow discriminating between the effects of performing a therapy based on an environment rich in stimuli and an austere one. In the case of subjective perceptions, based on the results of the SAM test, the subjects perceive significant differences between the basal stage and the therapies, and also between each of the two graphic environments. Conclusions Users reflected that a graphic environment rich in detail was more pleasant and attractive than a schematic one. However, this is not reflected in values obtained from their physiological activity, which suggests that more research is needed about the online inference of the emotional state of the subject from the record of his physiological activity.",

With this objective, different techniques of configuring facilities have been documented in literature. Among them are cellular and distributed layouts. Cellular layouts are applicable in scenarios where demand and product mix are relatively stable and rational part families/machine cells can be identified. With this assumption, the literature provides many techniques for their design. Distributed layout, on the other hand, are recommended in volatile environments where product demand and mix are changing very rapidly. However, we argue that a real-life scenario may lay within the spectrum of these two extremes. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by developing a mathematical model that integrates distributed layout design and machine cell formation with an objective to minimize a weighted sum of material handling and inter cellular movement costs. Through distributing the machines over the shop floor, the model attempts to minimize material handling cost. By identifying possible machine cells and part families, it attempts to minimize inter cellular movements. At the same time, the model ensures that machines that belong to the same cell are laid out on contiguous physical locations so that the advantages of cellular manufacturing systems can be fully exploited. Operations sequence, alternative routing, workload balancing among cells and other pragmatic issues are also incorporated in the model. We developed a parallel multiple search path simulated annealing to solve the proposed model efficiently.

However, the current implementation mainly requires administrator to manually design low-level implementation and optimization, we proposes an adaptive I/O congestion control framework, named AIOC2, which can not only adaptively tune the I/O congestion control parameters, but also exploit the deep Q-learning method to start the training parameters and optimize the tuning for different types of workloads from the server and the client at the same time. AIOC2 combines the feedback-based dynamic I/O congestion control and deep Q-learning parameter tuning technology to achieve autonomic I/O congestion control, improve system I/O throughput, and thus reduce I/O latency without human interference. Experimental results show that AIOC2 can greatly reduce the impact of I/O congestion on I/O throughput and I/O latency performance in Lustre clusters. Compared to existing Lustre cluster systems, AIOC2 can increase write I/O throughput by 34.82% and decrease I/O latency by 26.17% on average.",

In contemporary society, osteoporosis is more common than cancer and stroke and results in a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in the human population. Osteoporosis can conclusively be diagnosed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this study, we propose a computer-aided osteoporosis detection (CAOD) technique that automatically measures bone mineral density (BMD) and generates an osteoporosis report from a DXA scan. Methods The CAOD model denoise and segments DXA images using a non-local mean filter, Machine learning pixel label random forest respectively, and locates regions of interest with higher accuracy. Pixel label random forest classifies a pixel either bone or soft tissue; then contours are extracted from binary image to locate regions of interest and calculate BMD from bone and soft tissues pixels. Mean standard deviation and correlation coefficients statistical analysis were used to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of BMD measurements. Results During a consistency test of BMD measurements using three consecutive scans from Computerized Imaging Reference Systems’ Bona Fide Phantom (CIRS-BFP) for the spine, the CAOD model showed an averaged standard deviation of 0.0029 while the standard deviation from manual measurements on the same data set by three different individuals was recorded as 0.1199. During another correlation study of BMD measurements evaluating real human scan images by the CAOD model versus manual measurement, the model scored a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9901 while the CIRS-BFP study scored a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9709. Conclusions The CAOD model increases the preciseness and accuracy of BMD measurements. This CAOD method will help clinicians, untrained DXA operators, and researchers (medical scientists, doctors, and bone researchers) use the DXA system with reliable accuracy and overcome workload challenges. It will also improve osteoporosis diagnosis from DXA systems and increase system performance and value.",

Agreements were created with private providers to diminish the workload in the public sector. However, the growth of the private sector is not following the demand for care. Given this context, new management strategies have to be considered in order to minimize patient length of stay in waiting lists while reducing the costs and increasing (or at least maintaining) the quality of care. Method Appointment scheduling systems are today known to be proficient in the optimization of health care services. Their utilization is focused on increasing the usage of human resources, medical equipment and reducing the patient waiting times.

The state-of-the-art approach to tackle this concern is to use guard-band. However, this policy can adversely decrease the performance gain obtained by CIs as the gap between worst-case delay and true delay due to PVTA variations is increased. This paper proposes a novel approximate CI selection technique to address this issue. This technique allows the applications which do not require perfect accuracy to experience a tolerable amount of timing errors imposed by PVTA variations in favor of significantly improving the performance of the extensible processor. To achieve this, the proposed CI selection technique not only considers those CIs which their PVTA-aware delay is less than the given timing constraint, but also it takes into account the approximate CIs (i.e., those CIs that cannot strictly meet the timing constraint resulting in noisy/approximate computations). First, a timing analysis is performed to precisely compute the delay distribution of CIs in the presence of workload- and circuit-dependent PVTA variations. Then, based on the obtained distribution for each CI, a fault-map (i.e., timing error locations) is extracted. Using the fault-map, each circuit-level timing error is propagated to application-level to evaluate the quality/accuracy of the application output in the presence of PVTA-induced errors in approximate CIs. Finally, based on this cross-layer information, an optimal set of CIs is selected. This set results in maximum performance per silicon area under the given constraints on the power consumption and the errors which can be tolerated by the user. The simulations for various benchmark applications show that the proposed cross-layer technique results in up to 2.7× speedup increase compared to the existing techniques, which comes at the expense of 6% more error.",

Dispensing the wrong medication is often associated with mix-up of lookalike and soundalike drugs in high workload environments. Replacing manual dispensing with automated unit dose and medication dispensing systems to reduce medication errors is not always feasible in clinical facilities experiencing high patient turn-around or frequent dose changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) based pill recognition tools and smartphone applications could potentially aid healthcare workers in identifying pills in situations where more advanced dispensing systems are not implemented. Objective Most of the published research on pill recognition focuses on theoretical aspects of model development using traditional coding and deep learning methods. The use of code-free deep learning (CFDL) as a practical alternative for accessible model development, and implementation of such models in tools intended to aid decision making in clinical settings, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we sought to address this gap in existing literature by investigating whether CFDL is a viable approach for developing pill recognition models using a custom dataset, followed by a thorough evaluation of the model across various deployment scenarios, and in multicenter clinical settings. Furthermore, we aimed to highlight challenges and propose solutions to achieve optimal performance and real-world applicability of pill recognition models, including when deployed on smartphone applications. Methods A pill recognition model was developed utilizing Microsoft Azure Custom Vision platform and a large custom training dataset of 26,880 images captured from the top 30 most dispensed solid oral dosage forms (SODFs) at the three participating hospitals. A comprehensive internal and external testing strategy was devised, model's performance was investigated through the online API, and offline using exported TensorFlow Lite model running on a Windows PC and on Android, using a tailor-made testing smartphone application. Additionally, model's calibration, degree of reliance on color features and device dependency was thoroughly evaluated. Real-world performance was assessed using images captured by hospital pharmacists at three participating clinical centers. Results The pill recognition model showed high performance in Microsoft Azure Custom Vision platform with 98.7 % precision, 95.1 % recall, and 98.2 % mean average precision (mAP), with thresholds set to 50 %. During internal testing utilizing the online API, the model reached 93.7 % precision, 88.96 % recall, 90.81 % F1-score and 87.35 % mAP. Testing the offline TensorFlow Lite model on Windows PC showed a slight performance reduction, with 91.16 % precision, 83.82 % recall, 86.18 % F1-score and 82.55 % mAP. Performance of the model running offline on the Android application was further reduced to 86.50 % precision, 75.00 % recall, 77.83 % F1-score and 69.24 % mAP. During external clinical testing through the online API an overall precision of 83.10 %, recall of 71.39 %, and F1-score of 75.76 % was achieved. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that using a CFDL approach is a feasible and cost-effective method for developing AI-based pill recognition systems. Despite the limitations encountered, our model performed well, particularly when accessed through the online API. The use of CFDL facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, resulting in human-centered AI models with enhanced real-world applicability. We suggest that rather than striving to build a universally applicable pill recognition system, models should be tailored to the medications in a regional formulary or needs of a specific clinic, which can in turn lead to improved performance in real-world deployment in these locations. Parallel to focusing on model development, it is crucial to employ a human centered approach by training the end users on how to properly interact with the AI based system to maximize benefits. Future research is needed on refining pill recognition models for broader adaptability. This includes investigating image pre-processing and optimization techniques to enhance offline performance and operation on handheld devices. Moreover, future studies should explore methods to overcome limitations of CFDL development to enhance the robustness of models and reduce overfitting. Collaborative efforts between researchers in this domain and sharing of best practices are vital to improve pill recognition systems, ultimately enhancing patient safety and healthcare outcomes.",

An important area where such integration is required is for the role of anticipation by drivers to compensate for critical traffic situations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Anticipation Reliance (AR), which acts as a demand lowering compensative effect for the driving task by relying more on anticipation. We implement AR in a generic multi-scale microscopic traffic modelling and simulation framework to explore and explain the effects of HF on traffic operations and safety in critical traffic situations. This concept addresses a disparity in the description of driver workload in relation to the execution of driving tasks in regard to the confidence that drivers place on tasks that are sub-consciously catered for. The crossover from HF to a mathematical description of this role of AR introduces a ground-breaking concept that explains and models the mechanisms that allow drivers to compensate and avoid accidents in many circumstances, even when driving errors or sub-optimal driving performance occurs. By and large, the HF effects can be subdivided in effects on perception and anticipation; effects on sensitivity and response to stimuli; and effects on personal attributes and characteristics. A key aspect of the framework are two intertwined driver-specific mental state variables—total workload and awareness—that bridge between classic collision-free idealized models for lane changing and car following, and HF models that explain under which conditions the performance of drivers deteriorates in terms of reaction time, sensitivity to stimuli or other parameters. In this paper, we focus on the awareness construct, as described by AR, and explore the effects. We prove the effectiveness of the approach with a case example that demonstrates the ability of the model to dissect a complex traffic situation with both longitudinal and lateral driving tasks, while endogenously considering human factors and that produces accident avoidance and occurrence within the same order of magnitude compared to real traffic accident statistics.",

Mackenzie supported federal and Virginia policymakers, in real-time, for a large number of “what-if” scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continues to be used to answer related questions as COVID-19 transitions to the endemic stage of the disease. MacKenzie is a novel HPC meta-scheduler that can execute US-scale simulation models and associated workflows that typically present significant big data challenges. The meta-scheduler optimizes the total execution time of simulations in the workflow, and helps improve overall human productivity. As an exemplar of the kind of studies that can be conducted using Mackenzie, we present a modeling study to understand the impact of vaccine-acceptance in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the US. We use a 288 million node synthetic social contact network (digital twin) spanning all 50 US states plus Washington DC, comprised of 3300 counties, with 12 billion daily interactions. The highly-resolved agent-based model used for the epidemic simulations uses realistic information about disease progression, vaccine uptake, production schedules, acceptance trends, prevalence, and social distancing guidelines. Computational experiments show that, for the simulation workload discussed above, MacKenzie is able to scale up well to 10 K CPU cores. Our modeling results show that, when compared to faster and accelerating vaccinations, slower vaccination rates due to vaccine hesitancy cause averted infections to drop from 6.7M to 4.5M, and averted total deaths to drop from 39.4 K to 28.2 K across the US. This occurs despite the fact that the final vaccine coverage is the same in both scenarios. We also find that if vaccine acceptance could be increased by 10% in all states, averted infections could be increased from 4.5M to 4.7M (a 4.4% improvement) and total averted deaths could be increased from 28.2 K to 29.9 K (a 6% improvement) nationwide.",

Combined with gestures, this can provide haptic feedback to guide users, thereby overcoming the lack of agency associated with pure gestural interfaces, and reducing the need for vision – it is therefore particularly apropos of the driving domain. In a counter-balanced 2 × 2 driving simulator study, a traditional in-vehicle touchscreen was compared with a virtual mid-air gestural interface, both with and without ultrasound haptics. Forty-eight experienced drivers (28 male, 20 female) undertook representative in-vehicle tasks – discrete target selections and continuous slider-bar manipulations – whilst driving. Results show that haptifying gestures with ultrasound was particularly effective in reducing visual demand (number of long glances and mean off-road glance time), and increasing performance (shortest interaction times, highest number of correct responses and least ‘overshoots’) associated with continuous tasks. In contrast, for discrete, target-selections, the touchscreen enabled the highest accuracy and quickest responses, particularly when combined with haptic feedback to guide interactions, although this also increased visual demand. Subjectively, the gesture interfaces invited higher ratings of arousal compared to the more familiar touch-surface technology, and participants indicated the lowest levels of workload (highest performance, lowest frustration) associated with the gesture-haptics interface. In addition, gestures were preferred by participants for continuous tasks. The study shows practical utility and clear potential for the use of haptified gestures in the automotive domain.",

Companies operating in the MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) sector have to additionally deal with major variations of work load and work contents. In addition, the operational processes of the maintenance contractors are strongly affected by the influence of the customers. The delivery date of the corresponding order is highly influenced by the customer. Besides the information about the actual work load is only completely known when the inspection is completed. Since the planning of the maintenance event and the maintenance operation are hard to handle, the focus of the approach presented in this paper is set on improving the maintenance operation by finding suitable scheduling rules for the job-shop operation of the maintenance. We hypothesize that the use of scheduling rules can improve the maintenance operation. The main question which is answered in this paper is the question if an improvement of the logistical targets of the maintenance system can be accomplished with the use of decentralized scheduling rules. As part of the examination, a systematic simulation based approach for the identification of scheduling rules is defined. Due to the need of different studies, a simulation model is developed. With this model, the different simulation studies can easily be accomplished. The simulation results show an influence of the decentralized scheduling before each of the machine tools. The best results were achieved by the combinations of FIFO/Slack and ESD/Slack with an influence on the target values on-time delivery, work in progress, the throughput, the performance and the throughput time. Further on a tool for the implementation of the identified scheduling rule in a decentralized shop control is described. Besides the validation of the tool in an aircraft engine company is made. The application of a Slack rule during a period with increased workload of 36% showed a nearly constant on-time delivery.",

It is known that fatigue as well as hypovigilance are severe risk factors for traffic accidents while an effective countermeasure is sleeping. In Level 4 automation sleeping while driving becomes a possible scenario, including the issues of transitions. Several seconds for take-over as known from distraction studies are not enough to adjust the seat, regain control and recover after sleeping. Furthermore, when analyzing human performance after sleeping, the phenomenon of sleep inertia may affect reaction time and quality of performance. Take-over time and the effect of sleep inertia are investigated in a driving simulator study with 44 participants. As independent variable, the time after waking-up until taking over is varied: The participants had to take-over the driving task one minute, seven minutes or 15 min after waking up. A control group completed the task without sleeping. Lane keeping, deviation of line during the lane change task, braking time and mental workload served as dependent variables. There were no significant differences in driving performance between the groups when looking at driving performance, safety aspects and mental workload, hence no effect of sleep inertia was measured here. Further studies should investigate individual performance of more outliers and apply even more controlled measures to understand better if and how sleep inertia can become a problem for driving and what countermeasures should be applied. The study also shows, that take-over time of one minute leads to successful, but hectic take-overs, whereas a take-over time of 15 min induces fatigue in some drivers. We conclude that powernaps have a good chance to become a safe reality in Level 4 automation with a suitable take-over time between one and seven minutes.",1

Designing optimized accelerators that can meet particular requirements has always presented a tremendous challenge to hardware engineers. To do so, designers have to trade off performance for power consumption in a manner such that the final RTL consumes minimum energy to meet the required performance (e.g. FLOPS) target. Moreover, the growing trend towards heterogeneous platforms is crucial to meet time and power consumption constraints of high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The OpenCL parallel programming language and framework enables programming CPU, GPU and recently FPGAs using the high-level synthesis (HLS) methodology. This work presents a design space exploration flow based on execution time, resource utilization and power consumption of OpenCL kernels mapped on FPGAs using the Xilinx high-level synthesis tool chain. Our experiments suggest that the quality of generated solutions, in terms of performance-per-watt, can be determined using analytical formulas prior to implementation, thus enabling fast and accurate DSE by considering on-chip and off-chip sources of parallelism. Moreover, the automated flow suggests design hints to meet a given time constraint within available resources. The proposed technique is demonstrated by optimizing the well known bitonic sorting network from NVIDIA’s OpenCL benchmark. Our results report that FPGAs have at least 20% higher performance-per-watt with respect to two high-end GPUs manufactured in the same technology (28 nm). Additionally, FPGAs with more available resources and using a more modern process (20 nm) can outperform the tested GPUs while consuming at least 55% less power at the cost of more expensive devices.",

Cutter contacting (CC) point calculation is considered as a basic procedure of tool path generation. The step lengths formed by cutter contacting points have an effect on the chord error along feed direction. In traditional calculation method for CC point discretization, the segments connected by adjacent CC points distribute on both sides of the theoretical tool path curve. This situation magnifies the cutting error to some extent and enlarges the expected margin if the surface demands polishing or grinding. Aiming at this issue, this paper proposes an improved constant chord error method for CC point calculation. In the proposed method, the CC points lay on the theoretical tool path curve when the tool path curve is concave and lay on the chord error offset curve when is convex, which ensures the segments connected by the adjacent CC points distribute on one side of design surface, the side of the scallop height between tool paths. Therefore, the actual margin of polishing or grinding can be reduced. The influence of inflection points is also considered in this method to avoid accuracy deterioration caused by the long steps occurring near the inflection points. In part processing, local gouging and global collision must be avoided in tool orientation determination. This paper analyzes tool orientations with no rear gouging and no collision based on the calculated CC points. The novel discretization method for CC points is calculated on a single blade model, and the tool orientations are generated on an open integral impeller. A DMG DMU50 machine tool and a Hexagon three coordinates measuring machine are applied for experiments and measurements. The results show that, the CC point discretization method proposed in this paper offers many advantages over the traditional constant chord error method and commercial software, such as quantity of points, curve fitting, no overcut, and residual margin distributing. At last, blade and tunnel of the open integral impeller with safety tool orientation is machined and verified on the DMG DMU50 machine tool.",

However, the coupled workload of heat and cutting forces make broaching tool having the problem of serious wear. Many studies have shown that the use of biomimetic microstructure can reduce the cutting load, but the load reduction mechanism is unclear. In this regard, a novel dry broaching experiment, inspired by the dung beetle surface, was designed to investigate the load reduction mechanism of microstructure broach. To reveal the mechanism, the broaching load, chip reduction coefficient and tool-chip adhesion length were compared with four kinds of rake face microstructures, which is conventional broach (without microstructures), biomimetic one (BM), micro-pit (PM) and micro-groove (GM). And all of above microstructures were fabricated by single point diamond tool (SPDT). It can be found that the biomimetic microstructure (BM) can reduce more tool-chip contact area, meanwhile enhance the ability of capturing debris. Otherwise, the obtained results revealed that biomimetic microstructures (BM) broach could reduce broaching load, chip reduction coefficient and tool-chip adhesion length by amount of 12.31 %, 8.23 % and 18.38 % compared to conventional one, respectively.",

The NRP aims to optimize the allocation of human resources and to effectively reduce the workload to improve the efficiency and quality of nurses’ work. As various constraints must be considered, the NRP is complicated and is known to be NP-hard. The fast attainment of an efficient schedule is a challenging problem that requires urgent resolution. In this paper, we propose a neural network-assisted method for automating the complex and costly design of the heuristics. The method integrates a generic deep neural network (DNN) model and a generic recurrent neural network (RNN) model. The DNN model is used to guide the heuristic selection; the RNN model is embedded into the reconstruction mechanism to escape the local optimum. By treating schedules as matrices, the neural networks can help decide which heuristic to apply next and generate feasible solutions. Four experiments with different focuses based on benchmark instances are conducted by comparing different parameters as well as other state-of-the-art methods. Detailed computational results revealed the performance of the proposed method, results from the proposed algorithm outperforms the results reported in recent literature and state-of-the-art heuristic approaches in at least half of the instances, the proposed method also shows better performance compared with three reproduced deep reinforcement (DRL) learning methods, it is also competitive as an component of the hybrid method.",

An increase in crashes related to autonomous driving systems has raised a concern regarding the safety of other roadway users due to the diminishing accountability resulting from a general lack of understanding of the limitations or disregard of the safety protocols by users. To keep drivers vigilant when engaged in partial automated systems, a methodology to monitor real-time driver comprehension was proposed. A driving simulator study consisting of 90 participants, equally split between males and females, was executed to establish driver comprehension in six different variations of driving difficulty. Joint probability density functions were created by considering percent time spent gazing, answers to probe questions, and driving performance. Based on these density functions, five levels of comprehension were devised and assigned thresholds. Overall, as task difficulty increased, a non-linear deterioration in driving speed along with an increase in total gaze duration was observed before comprehension was attained. A two-step validation protocol was also proposed to ensure similar levels of comprehension to non-automated driving from the human driver, when engaged in early forms of automation. The proposed real-time driver comprehension monitoring constitutes a first step toward developing a methodology to reinstate the accountability of safety of other roadway users when engaged in driver-in-the-loop automation systems.",

In the Chernobyl accident, a series of operational errors during the turbine test by the operators led to the most serious nuclear leakage accident in history (Onisawa & Nishiwaki, 1988). To design a safe nuclear power control system, we need to consider not only the rationality of the operation, but also the HMI issues including reliability, convenience and comfort (Lagari et al., 2016). The nuclear power control system with great interaction effect can effectively reduce the physical and mental pressure of the operators, the complexity of observation data and the steps required for proper operation. Thereby it enhances the safety of the entire NPP. Thus, HMI in the control room is vital for successful design of future NPP control system.","['Wang, Chuanzan', 'Huang, Tao', 'Gong, Aicheng', 'Lu, Chao', 'Yang, Rui', 'Li, Xiu']",IFAC-PapersOnLine,53,851,856,2020,2020/01/01/,3rd IFAC Workshop on Cyber-Physical & Human Systems CPHS 2020,2405-8963,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.04.181,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896321003281'],"['Nuclear power plants', 'artificial intelligence', 'human-machine interaction', 'human errors']","In nuclear power plants, many accidents are caused by human errors.

The ability to predict the risk of outbreaks can improve prevention and control. There are few prediction models available, and of these most are manually constructed by human experts. These manual models are affected by the lack of automation and have limitations in data processing. They can be enhanced with modern machine-learning techniques. Machine learning (ML) based prediction models, however, have higher requirement for professional knowledge and are not broadly accessible to researchers who do not have ML expertise. We proposed automated machine learning (AutoML) as an advanced solution. It automates the entire ML design process for users without requiring ML knowledge, therefore allows non-ML experts to individually build ML models. To demonstrate the functionality of AutoML to develop reliable systems, we expanded an existing manually developed risk analysis model, EPIRISK, that uses economic, social and medical risk factors to predict epidemic risk. Using the AutoML platform BrewAI, we obtained an automatically generated ML model to predict epidemic risk. This was compared with six traditionally built machine learning models. The AutoML tool generated a model of 77% accuracy in predicting risk. It had similar accuracy to the six traditional built ML models. Such tools are easy to use and could make ML models more accessible to non-ML experts.",

One of the most commonly used anatomical structures in CR are the frontal sinuses, which are used in forensic human identification tasks due to their singularity and high identification power. In order to automate the comparison of frontal sinuses in AM and PM materials, we need to perform their segmentation and registration. However, these tasks are time-consuming, subjective, and complex. This paper presents the first CR-based identification system for the comparison of frontal sinuses and supporting the forensic expert’s decision. The proposed system comprises two building blocks. First, a frontal sinus segmentation method in X-ray images using deep convolutional neural networks. Different convolutional architectures are compared in solving the segmentation problem, obtaining an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of the frontal sinuses of 0.823 on a dataset composed of 234 skull radiographs. Second, an evolutionary-based 2D-3D IR method, that searches for the best alignment of segmented AM and PM images using a real-coded evolutionary algorithm. The proposed system is evaluated on a real multiple-comparison identification scenario including 10 X-ray images and 10 CTs, where manual and automatic segmentation approaches are compared. The global results shows that the proposed system is able to filter 50% of the sample. These preliminary results suggest that our system can reliably keep the true positive identity in the first half of the sample, allowing for a significant reduction of forensic experts’ workload and shortening identification times.",

To mitigate the negative experience of this technological limitation, researchers have suggested providing an explanation along with the takeover request to increase drivers’ understanding and trust in an automated driving system (ADS). However, previous studies on the explanation have been limited to investigations of unimodal explanations that use either text or speech, while neglecting other various in-vehicle display options. The present study aims to investigate the effects of multimodal explanation using three in-vehicle displays—ambient light, cluster, and sound. The explanation given by each in-vehicle display was systemically manipulated into two levels (ambient light: constant color vs. variable color, cluster: no-text and no-background vs. text with colored background, sound: alert-only sound vs. speech with alert sound). To examine the effects of the explanation using these displays, we conducted mixed method research including a scenario-based experiment, questionnaires, and a follow-up interview for thematic analysis. In the experiment, eighty-two participants drove in a driving simulator and performed takeover tasks in several types of urgent situations for measuring their takeover time and error. The participants then responded to questionnaires on takeover workload and overall trust in automated vehicle. Next, fifty-six of them participated in the follow-up interview for discovering significant themes related to their experiences with the multimodal explanation. As results, we found that multimodal explanations that use two types of displays were more effective than unimodal explanations or multimodal explanations using three types of displays. Regarding the effects of each type of display, the speech-based explanation showed the best takeover performance in general. The explanation using the cluster was next most useful in performance. The ambient light explanation showed less significant to no effect in the takeover situation. We expect that these findings can contribute to theoretical understanding of driver response to multimodal explanations and to practical design of trustworthy explanations in various takeover situations.",

He/she chooses a target to be reached among these candidates, and determines a velocity command for the end effector, while the computer also identifies a target through image processing.

Method Twenty-four adult males (mean age: 24.1 years; 3.6 SD) were randomly assigned to one of 4 bicep muscle eccentric exercise treatment groups (n = 6; “High Load, Low Repetition; High Rest, Low Frequency”, “High Load, Low Repetition; Low Rest, High Frequency”, “Low Load, High Repetition; High Rest, Low Frequency”, or “Low Load, High Repetition; Low Rest, High Frequency”) with non-dominant arm to induce muscle micro-trauma reactions in serum. Subjects in all treatment groups had equivalent total work volume, total rest duration and total work duration for comparison of muscle micro-trauma between and within the treatment groups. Muscle micro-trauma biomarker serum Creatine Kinase (CK) level was measured pre-exercise (Day 0) and post-exercise on Days 1, 2, 4, and 8. ANOVA with repeated measures was used to examine significance of rest and load-repetition combination over pre and post experiment days, as well as possible interactions. Result CK levels fluctuated significantly across different “Day” (P = 0.0115). Interaction was disordinal and significant between “Day” and “Rest” (P = 0.0000), and “Load” and “Rest” (P = 0.0322). Under “High Load, Low Repetition” condition, CK levels on Day 4 were significantly higher than on Days 0 and 2; CK levels on Day 8 were significantly higher than Day 0. CK level peaked on Day 4. Under “Low Rest” Condition, CK level on Days 4 and 8 are significantly higher than Day 0. Conclusion Shorter but more frequent rest intervals led to more extreme muscle micro-traumatic responses than the longer but less frequent ones, especially under “High Load, Low Repetition” condition when non-dominant bicep brachii was subscribed with eccentric exercise regimen. Relevance to industry The exploration of how rest scheduling affects progression of microtrauma from a biomechanical and molecular level in this study furthers current understanding of the early stage development of WMSDs. With future studies’ further research and confirmation, the findings of this study may be able to serve as a first attempt to guide shift scheduling and job design at manufacturing facilities.",

Newest interventions are based on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) since children with ASD cope well with stylized, rule-based and predictable systems. These collaborative approaches encompass therapy games based on joint exercises, imitation and interaction between robots and children. This paper’s aim was to implement an algorithm to automatically recognize small and similar gestures within a humanoid-robot therapy called IOGIOCO for ASD children. IOGIOCO is a multi-level HRI therapy meant to teach 19 meaningful gestures in a semantic framework based on a feedback interaction. Gestures were tracked as 3D coordinates of body keypoints captured by a Kinect. A Residual Neural Network was implemented and trained on a segmented Dataset acquired within this study to generate the offline model which was then exploited in a real-time classification using a sliding window. Feedback as sound stimuli from NAO robot was provided based on the automatic evaluation of each performance. Clinical acquisitions were carried out on 4 ASD children within the IOGIOCO therapy. Offline recognition was successful: exploiting Artificial Neural Networks we reached 95% of test accuracy for 19 gestures. A real-time recognition on healthy subjects reached 94% accuracy. Clinical applications were evaluated through the F1 score that achieved 79% value. These outcomes were encouraging considering the wide gesture set and all the challenges the therapy raises.

Combining these techniques requires adjusting various parameters, and recent studies have found that it is difficult to do so while obtaining both high throughput performance and low latency. This is especially true for mixed use data centres that host both latency-sensitive applications and high-throughput workloads with east–west traffic such as Hadoop. This paper studies the difficulty in configuration, and characterises the problem as related to ACK packets. Such packets cannot be set as ECN Capable Transport (ECT), with the consequence that a disproportionate number of them are dropped. The same issue can affect other non-ECT-capable traffic that may co-exist on the network. We explain how this behavior adversely affects throughput, and propose a small change to the way that non-ECT-capable packets are handled in the network switches. Using NS–2 simulation, we demonstrate robust performance for modified AQMs on a Hadoop cluster, maintaining full throughput while reducing latency by 85%. We also demonstrate that commodity switches with shallow buffers are able to reach the same throughput as deeper buffer switches. Finally, we explain how both TCP using ECN and DCTCP can achieve the best performance using a simple marking threshold, in contrast to the current preference for relying on AQMs to mark packets. Overall, we provide recommendations to network equipment manufacturers, cluster administrators and the whole industry on how best to combine high-throughput and latency-sensitive workloads.

To address this concern we propose a multi-tiered compression (MTC) technique combined with novel encoding that can decrease the probability of write disturbance. MTC compresses a high proportion (>94%) of cachelines by a small predictable amount (e.g., 40- or 56-bits of a 512-bit block) while maintaining data similarity vital for optimizing PCM writes. By detecting data patterns prone to crosstalk, we use encoding, correction pointers, and a hybrid approach to reduce the instances of write disturbance. We use MTC reclaimed bits to store the encoding. Thus, our approach requires only five additional auxiliary bits per 512-bit cacheline, minimizing the embodied energy (fabrication) overhead to mitigate write disturbance. Additionally, through a multi-objective optimization, dramatic endurance improvements are possible while maintaining nearly all write disturbance improvement. Our technique improves performance, endurance and write energy by 47%, 42% and 36% versus the state-of-the-art with nominal (circa 1%) increases to embodied energy. When considering the full life-cycle impact, the additional area of our MTC with encoding approach is mitigated by the use-phase benefits within 60 days for a high performance system and in less than four years of use for a desktop system. In nearly all studied scenarios, the improved lifetime provided by our MTC and encoding approach easily recoups the required additional upfront manufacturing energy.",

This research presents highly selective detection of acetone and its binary mixture in the pure air by a single SnO2-based metal oxide gas sensor. The sensor, whose sensing area was optimized by the nanometric thin lines structure to increase its surface-to-volume ratio, was combined with a 1D-convolution neural network (1D-CNN) and optimized with fragments blend and unified weights (CNN-FBUW) to identify acetone concentrations from time-series resistance noise. To explain the recognition mechanism, we have transformed the input data and trained those datasets with the same CNN architecture. Amplitude and high-frequency information of resistance fluctuation were proven essential for gas recognition. A higher sensitive device amplifies the amplitude information, benefiting deep learning algorithms to explore adsorption and desorption processes on the SnO2 layer. Acetone/ethanol binary gases’ mixtures were possibly identified with the model only trained with individual acetone gas data, which is considered a novel approach to relieving the data collection workload.",

This complex and capital-intensive production environment needs an efficient capacity planning decision that determines the order release schedule, estimated machine start and finished time of each order, and machine allocations to improve the performance of the entire production process.

Group responses to resource or task demand emerge from the specific actions of individuals within the group. Bumble bee colonies need to respond to resource demands for both pollen and nectar for colony growth and reproduction. Bumble bee workers have been shown to display differences in foraging preferences for these essential resources and in activity level. This study investigated the responses of Bombus terrestris individuals to resource demand by subjecting colonies to different pollen and sucrose storage scenarios, considering their individual foraging preferences and activity levels. The sucrose sensitivity and olfactory learning ability of individuals were then compared along a spectrum of foraging preference (between pollen and sucrose foraging) using the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. When sucrose was in demand, individuals with a preference for sucrose showed the largest upregulation in foraging bouts. Individual preference for pollen and activity level correlated with the upregulation of foraging bouts when pollen was in demand. This study detected no relationship between body size, sucrose preference and worker sucrose sensitivity or olfactory learning ability, tested with proboscis extension reflex conditioning. This study highlights the potential value of foraging preferences in bumble bee colonies but also the flexibility these colonies have with a small foraging workforce.",

A recently discussed challenge in cyber defence teaching and training is the gap between the fast technological advancement accompanied by rapidly changing demands on future cyber defence operators, and the lack of science-based teaching and training methods. A growing body of evidence suggests a crucial role of human factors as a central predictor for human performance in sociotechnical systems. While this has been acknowledged in a wide range of safety-critical applied fields, there is still a lack of knowledge about the impact of human factors on cyber defence performance. The lack of conventional metrics of performance and learning progress contribute to this deficit. To address this gap, the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy (NDCA) follows a science-based educational approach that identified in a series of empirical studies cognitive-psychological predictors for learning success of future cyber defence operators. These predictors and elements of a human factors research program are deeply embedded into educational practice and include processes such as metacognition, self-regulation, coping, communication and shared mental modelling. Slow education methods and mentoring are fundamental to enabling the advancement of human factors cognisance among military cyber cadets. As a tool for efficient training, the NDCA developed and implemented a mentoring concept that involves a cyber defence retrospective timeline analysis involving expert and practitioner level mentors. The timeline differentiates between performance relevant hard- and soft-skills and leads progressively towards an alignment of Security Operation Centre (SOC)- and expert judgments of performance. The NDCA argues that this educational concept facilitates educational benefits based on insight, accurate self-perception, motivation and decreased team workloads following more efficient collaboration.",19

Currently, the majority of ADAS employ a single, often very simple, driver model to predict human-driver interaction in the immediate future (e.g., next few seconds). However, there is tremendous variability in how each individual drives, necessitating personalized driver models, based on data collected from observed actual driver actions. Yet, because we currently lack sufficient knowledge of the high-level cognitive brain functions, traditional control-theoretic driver models have difficulty accurately predicting driver actions. Recently, machine-learning algorithms have been utilized to predict future driver control actions. We compare several of these algorithms used to predict the lateral control actions of human drivers. Specifically, we compare these algorithms in terms of their suitability to develop haptic-shared ADAS, which share the control force with the human driver. To this end, we need to know how the steering torque is provided by the driver. However, low-cost driving simulators typically measure steering angle but not steering torque. Thus, this work also proposes a methodology to estimate the steering-wheel torque. Using the estimated steering torque, we train several machine learning driver control models and compare the performance using both simulated and real human-driving data sets.",

Therefore, special considerations to mitigate operator errors should be taken when designing an operator-assistance system for construction cranes. With the goal of improving the operators' situation awareness (SA) of safety risks, this research presents a novel framework and practical system architecture for an operator-assistance system by leveraging real-time motion sensing and 3D modeling of dynamic workspaces.

Here, we develop a deep-learning approach for accurate non-invasive digital histology with whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fast spoiled gradient echo brain MRI exams (n = 1,582) were preprocessed and input to the proposed deep-learning workflow for tumor segmentation, modality transfer, and primary site classification into one of five classes. Tenfold cross-validation generated an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.878 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.873,0.883). These data establish that whole-brain imaging features are discriminative enough to allow accurate diagnosis of the primary organ site of malignancy. Our end-to-end deep radiomic approach has great potential for classifying metastatic tumor types from whole-brain MRI images. Further refinement may offer an invaluable clinical tool to expedite primary cancer site identification for precision treatment and improved outcomes.",11

In this paper, we address this issue. We introduce an interval number theory to describe the uncertainty of the computing environment and a scheduling architecture to mitigate the impact of uncertainty on the task scheduling quality for a cloud data center. Based on this architecture, we present a novel scheduling algorithm (PRS11Proactive and Reactive Scheduling.) that dynamically exploits proactive and reactive scheduling methods, for scheduling real-time, aperiodic, independent tasks. To improve energy efficiency, we propose three strategies to scale up and down the system's computing resources according to workload to improve resource utilization and to reduce energy consumption for the cloud data center.

However, these techniques cannot handle tasks that require contextual knowledge not readily available in the images alone. Thus, the supervision of an expert is necessary. We present a generative model for image segmentation, based on a Bayesian inference. Not only does our approach support an intuitive and convenient user interaction subject to the bottom-up constraints introduced by the image intensities, it also circumvents the main limitations of a human observer—3D visualization and modality fusion. The user “dialogue” with the segmentation algorithm via several mouse clicks in regions of disagreement, is formulated as a continuous probability map, that represents the user’s certainty to whether the current segmentation should be modified. Considering this probability map as the voxel-vise Bernoulli priors on the image labels allows spatial encoding of the user-provided input. The method is exemplified for the segmentation of cerebral hemorrhages (CH) in human brain CT scans; ventricles in degenerative mice brain MRIs, and tumors in multi-modal human brain MRIs and is shown to outperform three interactive, state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency and user-workload.",

In order to reduce human errors in the process of handling abnormal situations that are highly complex and mentally taxing activities, operators need to be supported, from a cognitive perspective, in order to reduce their workload, stress, and the consequent error rate. Of the various cognitive activities, a correct understanding of the situation, i.e. situation awareness (SA), is a crucial factor in improving performance and reducing errors. Despite the importance of SA in decision-making in time- and safety-critical situations, the difficulty of SA modeling and assessment means that very few methods have as yet been developed. This study confronts this challenge, and develops an innovative abnormal situation modeling (ASM) method that exploits the capabilities of risk indicators, Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic systems. The risk indicators are used to identify abnormal situations, Bayesian networks are utilized to model them and a fuzzy logic system is developed to assess them. The ASM method can be used in the development of situation assessment decision support systems that underlie the achievement of SA. The performance of the ASM method is tested through a real case study at a chemical plant.",

With this aim real-time systems are being implemented on top of high-performance multicore processors that run multithreaded periodic workloads by allocating threads to individual cores. In addition, to improve both performance and energy savings, the industry is introducing new multicore designs such as ARM’s big.LITTLE that include heterogeneous cores in the same package. A key issue to improve energy savings in multicore embedded real-time systems and reduce the number of deadline misses is to accurately estimate the execution time of the tasks considering the supported processor frequencies. Two main aspects make this estimation difficult. First, the running threads compete among them for shared resources. Second, almost all current microprocessors implement Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) regulators to dynamically adjust the voltage/frequency at run-time according to the workload behavior. Existing execution time estimation models rely on off-line analysis or on the assumption that the task execution time scales linearly with the processor frequency, which can bring important deviations since the memory system uses a different power supply. In contrast, this paper proposes the Processor–Memory (Proc–Mem) model, which dynamically predicts the distinct task execution times depending on the implemented processor frequencies. A power-aware EDF (Earliest Deadline First)-based scheduler using the Proc–Mem approach has been evaluated and compared against the same scheduler using a typical Constant Memory Access Time model, namely CMAT. Results on a heterogeneous multicore processor show that the average deviation of Proc–Mem is only by 5.55% with respect to the actual measured execution time, while the average deviation of the CMAT model is 36.42%. These results turn in important energy savings, by 18% on average and up to 31% in some mixes, in comparison to CMAT for a similar number of deadline misses.",

This often results in an increase in fatigue in the working population. The diversity of the workforce is also increasing, whereas physiological differences based on culture are important to consider. The objective of this study was to identify the differences in the levels of fatigue in the workplace experienced by Asian and Western workers in mentally demanding jobs. Method Eight Asian and eight Western participants completed an observation-based study. Each participant was observed for four hours in their workplace while they were working on highly mentally demanding work-tasks either computer programming or mathematical simulations. To balance the effect of time, half of the participants from each ethnic group were observed in the morning session and the other half in the afternoon session. Perceived fatigue was measured every 30 min using the single dimensional Borg and multidimensional SOFI scales. Workload was measured using NASA-TLX, and as a change in resting heart rate. Result Ethnicity and time interacted to significantly affect the perceived fatigue measured by Borg (F (9,126) = 2.03, p = 0.0412) and SOFI (F(9,126) = 3.28, p = 0.0013) scales. Asian participants reported significantly higher workload measured by NASA-TLX scores (F(1, 14) = 3.68, p = 0.0024) and change in resting heart rate (F(1, 14) = 7.77, p = 0.0145) was measured higher compared to Western participants. Unlike fatigue, no significant interactions were observed between time and ethnicity to affect either NASA-TLX scores or change in resting heart rate. Post-hoc analyses show that the rate of fatigue was higher for Asian participants. Correlations between the dependent variables were significant (p < 0.0001), with a stronger correlation identified for Asian participants. Conclusion As compared to the Western participants, Asian participants reported higher values in all dependent measures, including fatigue in both scales, NASA-TLX scores, and change in resting heart rate. Relevance to industry The significant growth in white-collar as well as mentally demanding jobs requires more cognitive resources, while reducing physical activities. The consequences of the imbalances in the use of body resources have yet to be studied. This study has been designed to investigate the issues of imbalance in the workplace.",

Biomechanical models have been developed to estimate joint loadings, which can help avoid strenuous physical exertion, potentially enhancing construction workforce productivity, safety, and well-being. However, the models used are mainly in 2D, or to predict static strength ignored their velocity and acceleration or using marker-based method for dynamic motion data collection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework for investigating the mechanical energy expenditure (MEE) of workers using a 3D biomechanical model based on computer vision-based techniques. Human 3D Pose Estimation algorithm based on 2D videos is applied to approximate the coordinates of human joints for working postures, and smart insoles are used to collect foot pressures and plantar accelerations, as input data for the biomechanical analyses. The results show a detailed MEE rate for the whole body, at which joints the maximum and minimum values were obtained to avoid excessive physical exertion. The proposed method can approximate the total daily MEE of construction tasks by summing the assumed cost of individual tasks (such as walking, lifting, and stooping), providing suggestions for the design of a daily workload that workers can sustain without developing cumulative fatigue.",

The main goal of current research efforts is improving measurement accuracy. Seeing as many of the possible solutions regarding CMM construction had already been explored, there seems to be little left for improvement in that field. Further efforts at accuracy improvement rely mostly on using sophisticated mathematical algorithms designed to correct relevant errors. Many types of errors could be compensated using this approach, including: probe head errors, machine dynamics errors and, most importantly, machine geometrical errors. Almost all coordinate measuring machines produced nowadays are equipped with geometrical errors compensation matrix known as the CAA matrix (Computer Aided Accuracy). CAA matrices are based on a grid of reference points (nodes) in which certain values of the components of geometrical errors are determined experimentally. The error values between the nodes are estimated using simple interpolation methods. Theoretically, a higher density of reference points on the grid describing the CAA matrix should improve the accuracy of the machine utilizing the matrix. On the other hand, increasing the number of nodes simultaneously increases the amount of workload, time and money spent on constructing the CAA matrix. This paper presents a number of experiments aimed at creating CAA matrices with different number of matrix nodes using the LaserTracer system. The relations between maximum permissible errors obtained on a machine using matrices with different densities of nodes are also discussed. Additionally, the authors attempt to tackle the question of determining the most optimal density of nodes with regards to the ratio of time spent on matrix creation and the effect on accuracy.",

However, the current determination of moment-rotation curves is mainly fitting results of experiments or simulations, which results considerable consumption of human and material resources. Hence, this paper proposes a new three-parameter exponential model for this type of joint to forecast the moment-rotation relation curve. Considering possible failure modes, a calculation method of ultimate bending moment for joints is proposed. An analysis model of initial rotational stiffness for joints is established according to component method. Based on the research results of this paper, the ultimate bending moment and initial rotational stiffness can be calculated straight by measurement factors and material properties. The values of the shape parameter for two kinds of the joint are derived by fitting the existing experimental data. Based on the established prediction model of moment-rotation, an accurate calculation method of ultimate bending moment, and analysis model of initial rotational stiffness, the prediction results are in good agreement with experimental results according to the comparison. The established moment-rotation model may be applied to the design of composite frames to predict the behavior of the joint with endplate and blind bolts simply and accurately.

One of the major challenges of highly automated vehicles is to ensure a timely (with respect to safety and situation awareness) takeover in such conditions. For this purpose, the current study investigated the role of an in-vehicle digital voice-assistant (VA) in conditionally automated vehicles, offering spoken discourse relating specifically to contextual factors, such as the traffic situation and road environment. The study involved twenty-four participants, each taking two drives (counterbalanced): with VA and without VA, in a driving simulator. Participants were required to takeover vehicle control following the issuance of a takeover request (TOR) near the end of each drive. A parametric duration model was adopted to find the key factors determining takeover time (TOT). Paired comparisons showed higher alertness and higher active workload (mean NASA-TLX rating) during automation when accompanied by the VA. Paired t-test comparison of gaze behavior prior to takeover showed significantly higher instances of checking traffic signal, roadside objects, and the roadway during the drive with VA, indicating higher situation awareness. The parametric model indicated that the VA increased the likelihood of making a timely takeover by 39%. There was also some evidence suggesting that male drivers are likely to resume control 1.21 times earlier than female drivers.

This data is analyzed by expert human inspectors to detect faults in the power lines infrastructure and prepare the inspection reports. This process is extremely time consuming, very expensive and prone to human error. In this paper, we present PoLIS: the Power Line Inspection Software, which has been developed with the objective of assisting the analysis of the data acquired during inspection flights. PoLIS is based on the cooperation between computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically process video sequences acquired during inspection flights, resulting in a set of representative images per electric tower which we call Key Frames. These representative images can then be used for inspection purposes, leading to a drastic reduction of the human operators’ workload. At the core of the strategy lies an electric tower detector, which is in charge of estimating the location of the towers within the images based on the combination of a sliding window search technique and a supervised classifier. The location of the tower is then tracked using a tracking-by-registration algorithm based on direct methods, estimating the position of the tower in different images. Finally, different criteria are applied for defining whether the image corresponds to a Key Frame image or not. Extensive evaluation of the proposed strategy is conducted using videos acquired during manned helicopter inspections. The videos constituting this database contain several thousand frames representing both medium and high voltage power transmission lines in the infra-red (IR) and visible spectra. The obtained results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the large amount of data present in the inspection videos to a few Key Frames for each tower. It is also demonstrated that the learning-based approach proposed in PoLIS is appropriate for detecting electric towers, a process which is made faster and more robust by coupling it with a tower tracking algorithm. A Graphical User Interface allowing the application of PoLIS to user-provided videos is also presented in this paper, illustrating the whole process and the automated generation of an inspection report.",

This study adopted 2 (Lai et al., 2016) approaches: approach 1 quantified the GPR response of air voids using forward modelling, while approach 2 used workflow prototyping and validation with inverse modelling. Forward simulations indicated that different ratios of void size to GPR signal footprint could result in a variety of patterns in B-scans: they can be hyperbolas, cross patterns, bowl shaped patterns and reverberations. With a database of void patterns of both C-scans and B-scans established, in approach 2 the workflow uses a pyramid pattern recognition method – with pixel value or gradient being used for feature identification – to search automatically for air-filled void responses in GPR data. The workflow was tested using 2 laboratory and field experiments and the results were promising. The constraint values proposed by the 2 experiments were validated with another site experiment.

Despite the extensive literature, the continuously increasing volumes of data produced by sensors (e.g., rates of several MB/s by 3D scanners such as LIDAR sensors), and the time-sensitivity of the applications leveraging the clustering outcomes (e.g., detecting critical situations such as detecting boundary crossing from a robot arm that could injure human beings) demand for efficient data clustering algorithms that can effectively utilize the increasing computational capacities of modern hardware. To that end, we leverage approximation and parallelization, where the former is to scale down the amount of data, and the latter is to scale up the computation. Regarding parallelization, we explore a design space for synchronization and workload distribution among the threads. As we study different parts of the design space, we propose representative Parallel Multiphase Approximate Cluster Combining, abbreviated as PARMA-CC, algorithms. We show that PARMA-CC algorithms yield equivalent clustering outcomes despite their different approaches. Furthermore, we show that certain PARMA-CC algorithms can achieve higher efficiency with respect to certain properties of the data to be clustered. Generally speaking, in PARMA-CC algorithms, parallel threads compute summaries associated with clusters of data (sub)sets. As the threads concurrently combine the summaries, they construct a comprehensive summary of the sets of clusters. By approximating a cluster with its respective geometrical summaries, PARMA-CC algorithms scale well with increasing data volumes, and, by computing and efficiently combining the summaries in parallel, they enable latency improvements. PARMA-CC algorithms utilize special data structures that enable parallelism through in-place data processing. As we show in our analysis and evaluation, PARMA-CC algorithms can complement and outperform well-established methods, with significantly better timeliness especially when utilizing multiple threads, while still providing highly accurate results in a variety of data sets, even with skewed data distributions, which cause the traditional approaches to exhibit their worst-case behaviour.",

Different secrecy levels can be decoded incrementally when different combinations of participants are gained. Firstly, we develop the model called the general AS (GAS) based RIVCS. Secondly, we design the algorithm for allocating secrecy levels. Thirdly, we construct the encoding matrices for sharing the secret pixels. Experimental results show that our method is more suitable to visualization data protection for network security situation with lower cost, higher reliability and richer application scenarios.",

Though some shape model-based methods exist, most of them focus on mathematical clustering and do not discuss the usability of the clustering results for product design. In this paper, a new shape-model based clustering method for product sizing is presented that takes into account both shape information and usability for designers. The new method, called constrained k-medoids clustering, is applied on a shape model of 100 human heads. It is compared to a partitioning around medoid (PAM) clustering of anthropometric measurements of the same 100 heads (i.e., feature-based), as well as to PAM clustering of the shape model (i.e., shape based). Results show that both shape-based and constrained clustering perform better than feature-based clustering, with an average size-weighted variance (SWV) of 62×103±16×103 and 66×103±26×103 as compared to 72×103±12×103, respectively. The average point-to-point distances in shape-based and constrained k-medoids were found to be similar to those of feature-based k-medoids, indicating that using 3D-anthropometry for product sizing will not have a negative impact on designer workload and/or a higher cost to implement more sizes. The results suggest that for head-based products, which require accurate shape and size fit, sizing systems should be created using either shape-based or constrained k-medoids, with the latter being slightly less accurate but more intuitive for further design and verification.",

It can be potentially prevented through early warnings of fatigue for further appropriate work shift arrangements. Many deep neural networks have recently been developed for the fatigue detection of vehicle drivers through training and processing the facial image or video data from the public driver's datasets. However, these datasets are difficult to directly use for the fatigue detections under crane operation scenarios due to the variations of facial features and head movement patterns between crane operators and vehicle drivers. Furthermore, there is no representative and public dataset with the facial information of crane operators under construction scenarios. Therefore, this study aims to explore and analyse the features of multi-sources datasets and the corresponding data acquisition methods which are suitable for crane operators' fatigue detection, further providing collection guidelines of crane operators dataset. Variations on public datasets such as real or pretend facial expression, the segment level of human-verified labelling, camera positions, acquisition scenarios, and illumination conditions are analysed. A hybrid learning architecture is proposed by combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for fatigue detection. In order to establish a unified evaluation criterion, the effort of the study includes relabelling three public vehicle drivers datasets, NTHU-DDD, UTA-RLDD, and YawnDD, with human-verified labels at the frame and minute segment levels, and training the corresponding hybrid fatigue detection models accordingly. The average detection accuracies and losses are identified for the trained models of UTA-RLDD, NTHU-DDD, and YawnDD individually. The trained models are used to evaluate the fatigue status of facial videos from licensed crane operators under simulated crane operation scenarios. The results suggest the necessary considerations of different influential factors for establishing a large and public fatigue dataset for crane operators.",

However, due to the rigidity of pattern matching, these systems typically require a large number of rules to adequately cover the variations of expression in unstructured text. Consequently, knowledge engineering for a new domain and knowledge maintenance for a fielded system are labor intensive and expensive. In this paper, we present our research on enhancing a rule-based event coding system by relaxing the rigidity of pattern matching with a technique that formulates and matches patterns of the semantics of words instead of literal words. Our technique pairs literal words with semantic vectors that accumulate word meaning from the context of use of the word found in dictionaries, ontologies, and domain corpora. Our method improves the speed, accuracy, and coverage of the event coding algorithm without additional knowledge engineering effort. Operating on semantics instead of syntax, the improved system eases the workload of human analysts who screen input text for critical events. Our algorithms are based on high-dimensional distributed representations, and their effectiveness and versatility derive from the unintuitive properties of such representations---from the mathematical properties of high-dimensional spaces. Our current implementation encodes words, phrases, and rule patterns as semantic vectors using WordNet, We have started experimental evaluation using a large newswire dataset.",

This paper proposes a method by which to extract important byte sequences of a given malware sample that characterize the functionality of the sample, which reduces the workload of human analysts who investigate the functionality of the sample. Design & methods: By applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an attention mechanism to an image converted from binary data, the proposed method enables calculation of an attention map, which is expected to specify regions having higher importance for classification. This distinction of regions enables the extraction of characteristic byte sequences peculiar to the malware family from the binary data and can provide useful information for human analysts without a priori knowledge. Results: The results of an evaluation experiment using a malware dataset reveal that the sequences extracted by the proposed method provide useful information for manual analysis. For example, in the case of Backdoor.Win32.Agobot.lt, the region with the highest importance in the attention map points at a function to receive commands from a remote server via IRC. This result characterizes the behavior of its family, Worm:Win32/Gaobot, which executes commands sent via IRC to construct a botnet. Conclusions: By taking advantage of a CNN with the attention mechanism, the proposed method is shown to provide important regions in the binaries selectively for manual analysis of malware samples.",

We have developed a system to grade FFB depending on its quality. Several palm features are extracted from RGB, near infrared, and depth images, captured with a Microsoft Kinect camera version 2.0 installed in a light-controlled environment on the conveyor line. Two main algorithms for classification have been developed. The first algorithm is called a volume integration scheme (SVIS), which measures the relative volume of palm bunch. The second developed algorithm classifies palm bunch into three grades (L-Grade, M-Grade and H-Grade) based on oil content from Soxhlet extraction.

However, cloud computing uses large scale data centers equipped with energy-hungry servers and huge power facilities that massively consume power. This presents a real challenge which can negatively influence the power grid, while exposing the environment to global warming issues. Therefore, minimizing cloud data center power consumption is a challenging problem and has to be addressed. In this paper, we look at renewable energy in the context of a smart grid–cloud architecture and investigate the issue of grid power dispatching to cloud data centers. Since cloud data centers have a non-cooperative nature regarding power demand from the power stations, we model our power allocation problem as a non-cooperative game. Afterwards, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we formulate the payoff function of our game as a non-linear optimization problem before resolving it using Lagrange multipliers and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. Thus, we determine the assigned optimal quantity to each data center based on three main criteria : renewable energy usage, number of critical running applications and workload charge. Extensive simulations are performed by comparing our scheme with an existing work. Results show that our scheme outperforms the comparing approach with a percentage of 31.2% in terms of power load rate and significantly reduces emissions of carbon dioxide.",

Many frameworks have been proposed to provide a uniform way to program for accelerators, such as GPUs, DSPs, and FPGAs. Among them, an open and royalty-free standard, OpenCL, is widely adopted by the industry. However, many OpenCL-enabled accelerators and the standard itself do not support preemptive multitasking. To the best of our knowledge, previously proposed techniques are not portable or cannot handle ill-designed kernels (the codes that are executed on the accelerators), which will never ever finish. This paper presents a framework (called CLPKM) that provides an abstraction layer between OpenCL applications and the underlying OpenCL runtime to enable preemption of a kernel execution instance based on a software checkpointing mechanism. CLPKM includes (1) an OpenCL runtime library that intercepts OpenCL API calls, (2) a source-to-source compiler that performs the preemption-enabling transformation, and (3) a daemon that schedules OpenCL tasks using priority-based preemptive scheduling techniques. Experiments demonstrated that CLPKM reduced the slowdown of high-priority processes from 4.66x to 1.52–2.23x under up to 16 low-priority, heavy-workload processes running in the background and caused an average of 3.02–6.08x slowdown for low-priority processes.",

The clustering input dataset collects the data available to a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. Clustering algorithms are used to define product families for the assignment of the workload to the processing resources. Several clustering algorithms (k-means, Gaussian mixture models and hierarchical clustering) define different product families scenarios using different tuning parameters. The impact of each clustering scenario on the operations is assessed via a dashboard of logistics KPIs to identify the best performing clustering algorithm. The performance of each clustering is, then, compared to a logistic benchmark given by a capacitated clustering to identify the best compromise between a logistic-constrained algorithm with a long runtime and fast data-driven uncapacitated algorithm.",

This complexity makes it difficult to manually probe the surface reactivity of such clusters. Here, we present a simple and automated method to systematically discover reaction pathways on cluster surfaces, based on the automated cluster surface scanning (ACSS) technique for mapping out potential energy surfaces. We showcase our method on 55-atom icosahedral Cu and Ag clusters, where we determine the activation energies of four elementary steps common in heterogeneous catalysis – hydrogen recombination (H* + H* → H2* + *), oxygen recombination (O* + O* → O2* + *), water formation (OH* + H* → H2O* + *), and CO oxidation (CO* + O* → CO2* + *) – with density functional theory calculations (DFT-PBE + D3). We show that the ACSS method requires significantly less human effort than the established manually performed climbing-image nudged elastic band (MP + CI-NEB) technique and locates transition states with comparable accuracy (root-mean-squared error of 0.10 eV) and similar computational cost. Rigorous sampling of the potential energy surface with the ACSS method allows one to locate all lowest-energy reaction pathways obtained via the MP+CI-NEB approach, as well as alternative pathways that one may have missed with the MP+CI-NEB approach due to the many possible pathways available on these clusters. The accuracy and efficiency afforded by the ACSS method could enable high-throughput exploration of the diverse reactivity of metal clusters.",

As they merge physical entities with cyber spaces, they fall under the paradigm of cyber-physical production systems. Cybersecurity is a key challenge for such systems, as they are subject to daily attempts of intruders to gain unauthorized access to their internal resources or to compromise their integrity. The fast increase of new attack strategies requires the rapid design and assessment of new defense strategies. It entails a complex, error-prone and time-consuming process, including the clear specification of the attack and defense strategies involved, and the design and implementation of the simulation model allowing to evaluate the performances of the defense strategy. This work intends to make such a process transparent to cybersecurity managers by limiting their workload to the sole specification of the characteristics of the system and the logic of the attack and the defense. It provides a generic hybrid simulation framework for flexible evaluation of cybersecurity policies, which is demonstrated on a SYN flooding application. Therefore, the contribution is twofold: (1) The proposed framework offers a high-level environment allowing various experts to collaborate by graphically modeling a given attack strategy and the envisioned defense strategy, without engaging in heavy implementation efforts. Then the framework's executable infrastructure, which combines simulation with machine learning to understanding the interactions between the attackers & the defender, will allow them assessing the performances of these strategies. The proposed framework differs from state-of-the-art cybersecurity simulation environments in its uniqueness to combining the expressive power of a universal simulation modeling formalism with the user-friendliness of a visual simulation tool. Therefore, it offers at one side, a very high modeling flexibility for easy exploration of various cybersecurity strategies, and at the other side, integrated learning capabilities for allowing self-adaptive user-based cybersecurity strategy design. (2) The application demonstrating the framework focuses on the most encountered and still uncontrolled threats in cybersecurity, i.e. the SYN-Flooding based Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The application targeted is not meant to propose yet another SYN flood detection algorithm or to improve the state-of-the-art in that domain, but to prove the framework operationality. The experimental results obtained showcase the ability of the framework to support learning simulation-based SYN flood defense algorithm design and validation.",

However, stromal cells are very similar in appearance to epithelial cells which must be excluded in the counting process. To exclude the epithelial cells from the counting process it is necessary to identify epithelial regions. There are two types of epithelial layers that can be encountered in the endometrium: luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing method that addresses the segmentation of both types of epithelium simultaneously in endometrial histology images. In this paper, we propose a multi-resolution Cell Orientation Congruence (COCo) descriptor which exploits the fact that neighbouring epithelial cells exhibit similarity in terms of their orientations.

Still, due to the massive workload, intensive graphics processing and delay intolerance, conventional cloud-only models are increasingly becoming ineffective. Thankfully, with the shift towards Mobile Edge Computing, game providers can leverage existing cellular infrastructure to deploy edge servers that supply gaming services in a highly accessible fashion. One fundamental challenge, that naturally arises, is the discovery of the most suitable player-to-edge server assignment strategy, that achieves a balanced trade-off between conflicting objectives that refer to high social interactivity on the one hand and low-cost server provisioning on the other. In this article, the core properties of social interactivity for gaming DIAs are investigated through formal formulation under diverse social aspects and strict assignment rules, respecting, in the meantime, the provisioning cost and constraints of the edge servers. We call this the “Social Interactivity-oriented Edge Allocation” (SIEA) problem and prove its NP-hardness. Based on our theoretical analysis, we present SIEA-H, a two-phase heuristic algorithm to efficiently assign players to servers and then iteratively refine the edge allocation strategy. SIEA-H is evaluated using comprehensive trace-driven simulations. The results demonstrate how it surpasses the baseline and state-of-the-art assignment alternatives in reducing the total cost, especially as the number of servers and their capacity grows, or the coverage area expands, while for players it exhibits the highest admission rate and the best overall resource management.",

Nonetheless, guideline-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are not widely implemented or used, are frequently out-of-date, and cannot address complex care for which guidelines do not exist. Here, we develop and evaluate a complementary approach – using Bayesian Network (BN) learning to generate adaptive, context-specific treatment menus based on local order-entry data. These menus can be used as a draft for expert review, in order to minimize development time for local decision support content. This is in keeping with the vision outlined in the US Health Information Technology Strategic Plan, which describes a healthcare system that learns from itself. Materials and methods We used the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm to learn four 50-node domain-specific BNs from 11,344 encounters: abdominal pain in the emergency department, inpatient pregnancy, hypertension in the Urgent Visit Clinic, and altered mental state in the intensive care unit. We developed a system to produce situation-specific, rank-ordered treatment menus from these networks. We evaluated this system with a hospital-simulation methodology and computed Area Under the Receiver–Operator Curve (AUC) and average menu position at time of selection. We also compared this system with a similar association-rule-mining approach. Results A short order menu on average contained the next order (weighted average length 3.91–5.83 items). Overall predictive ability was good: average AUC above 0.9 for 25% of order types and overall average AUC .714–.844 (depending on domain). However, AUC had high variance (.50–.99). Higher AUC correlated with tighter clusters and more connections in the graphs, indicating importance of appropriate contextual data. Comparison with an Association Rule Mining approach showed similar performance for only the most common orders with dramatic divergence as orders are less frequent. Discussion and conclusion This study demonstrates that local clinical knowledge can be extracted from treatment data for decision support. This approach is appealing because: it reflects local standards; it uses data already being captured; and it produces human-readable treatment-diagnosis networks that could be curated by a human expert to reduce workload in developing localized CDS content. The BN methodology captured transitive associations and co-varying relationships, which existing approaches do not. It also performs better as orders become less frequent and require more context. This system is a step forward in harnessing local, empirical data to enhance decision support.",

However, relocation generates movements that produce undesirable consequences from both economical and human resources management standpoints. Questions therefore arise: Is the relocation worth the effort? And if so, what form should it take? Unfortunately, this issue has not been investigated much up to now. This study thus focuses on evaluating and analyzing relocation strategies, and reports extensive simulation experiments allowing to analyze the performance of these strategies when the system faces different levels of workload. Our empirical study confirms that dynamic strategies dominate static ones and quantifies the improvements achieved with respect to service level, but also shows that such improvements are obtained at the expense of significant relocation costs.",

Owing to the complexity of technical documents, the direct application of IR often leads to unsatisfactory results. Therefore, many semantic approaches, such as ontology, are applied to enhance IR performance. However, ontology development is often a labor-intensive process and the availability of ontologies significantly influences the applicability of IR. Consequently, many efforts are dedicated to the automation of the ontology development process for reducing the human labors. In addition, reference collections, which are developed as the golden standards to evaluate IR performance in many IR research, can be regarded as an available resource for ontology development. To ease domain ontology development for supporting IR, this research proposes a semi-automated approach to develop a base domain ontology from a reference collection. This research also validates the base ontology on an Earthquake Engineering reference collection, called the NCREE (National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering) collection. The results reveal that the human workload of the proposed approach is affordable. Furthermore, the base domain ontology can help achieve a satisfactory IR performance.",

This paper investigates the usability of different interaction modes for agricultural robot teleoperation. Specifically, we examined the overall influence of two types of output devices (PC screen, head mounted display), two types of peripheral vision support mechanisms (single view, multiple views), and two types of control input devices (PC keyboard, PS3 gamepad) on observed and perceived usability of a teleoperated agricultural sprayer. A modular user interface for teleoperating an agricultural robot sprayer was constructed and field-tested. Evaluation included eight interaction modes: the different combinations of the 3 factors. Thirty representative participants used each interaction mode to navigate the robot along a vineyard and spray grape clusters based on a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated measures experimental design. Objective metrics of the effectiveness and efficiency of the human-robot collaboration were collected. Participants also completed questionnaires related to their user experience with the system in each interaction mode. Results show that the most important factor for human-robot interface usability is the number and placement of views. The type of robot control input device was also a significant factor in certain dependents, whereas the effect of the screen output type was only significant on the participants’ perceived workload index. Specific recommendations for mobile field robot teleoperation to improve HRI awareness for the agricultural spraying task are presented.",

Although similar to train driving, tram driving has its own unique skills requirements as well as higher demands on divided attention and decision-making in relation to operating in an environment with multiple road users. Due to the significant differences between the two tasks, research findings relating to train driving may not necessarily be applicable to tram driving. Despite this, very little research has been conducted on the tram-driving task in general and even less so relating to accidents and near misses. Australia has experienced a high incidence of tram collisions over the past decade and with new networks being planned for several cities and expansion of existing networks there is a potential for an increase in accidents. It is therefore timely to examine the tram-driving task and consider the human factors implications of tram collisions. This study incorporated reviews of accident reports, on-site observations, focus group exercises, and individual driver discussions. Results of the analysis revealed three major themes relating to causes of accidents: situation awareness, time pressure, and organizational behaviour. Interaction between these three themes was noted. This preliminary identified cultural issues and hinted at problems associated with normalization of deviance. Further analysis and research is needed to explore and unpack the themes with a view to determining effective strategies for tram organisations to implement to improve safety and minimize the risk of collisions.",

Researchers and practitioners agree that physical and mental stress should be proactively managed to mitigate their ill-effects which range from making errors to causing accidents and short term to long term illnesses. Accordingly, numerous research endeavors have pursued automated solutions for their monitoring to replace manual and subjective physical and mental stress monitoring. While these studies have been successful, they attempted to monitor either physical stress or mental stress at a time. Studies have shown that many times, construction workers are simultaneously exposed to both, physical and mental stress, necessitating automated simultaneous monitoring of physical and mental stress for more comprehensive workload evaluation. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the possibility of accurately monitoring physical and mental stress simultaneously using physiological measures and machine learning algorithms. For the purpose, experiments were conducted that comprised of physical and mental stress scenarios. The results showed that using 56 features derived from heart rate, skin temperature, breathing rate and skin conductance, an accuracy of 94.7% was achieved for simultaneous physical and mental stress monitoring. Additionally, the study further investigated the impact of varying the features and physiological measures and discussed the potential future work in this direction. Overall, this study for the first time, demonstrated that it is possible to simultaneously monitor physical and mental stress with high accuracy. Moreover, it has laid the foundation for future studies to enable simultaneous physical and mental stress monitoring on actual job sites.",

Linear mixed effects models were used to model the changes in cerebral hemodynamic response as a result of time spent training working memory. Nonlinear increases in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were observed with increased exposure to working memory training. Adaptive and yoked training groups also showed differential effects in rostral prefrontal cortex with increased exposure to working memory training. There was also a significant negative relationship between verbal working memory performance and bilateral VLPFC activation.

To solve this problem, the incremental extreme learning machine (I-ELM) is used to determine the appropriate number of hidden layer nodes and construct a compact network structure in this paper. At the same time, a new hidden layer activation function STR is proposed, which avoids the disadvantages of incomplete output information of hidden layer due to uneven distribution of sample data.

To date, in most cases, it is done manually by the radiologists. The overwhelming workload in some of the thickly populated nations may cause exhaustion leading to interruption for the doctors, which may pose a continuing threat to patient safety. A novel fusion method called U-Net inception based on 3D convolutions and transition layers is proposed to address this issue. Methods: A 3D deep learning method called Multi headed U-Net with Residual Inception (MhURI) accompanied by Morphological Gradient channel for brain tissue segmentation is proposed, which incorporates Residual Inception 2-Residual (RI2R) module as the basic building block. The model exploits the benefits of morphological pre-processing for structural enhancement of MR images. A multi-path data encoding pipeline is introduced on top of the U-Net backbone, which encapsulates initial global features and captures the information from each MRI modality. Results: The proposed model has accomplished encouraging outcomes, which appreciates the adequacy in terms of some of the established quality metrices when compared with some of the state-of-the-art methods while evaluating with respect to two popular publicly available data sets. Conclusion: The model is entirely automatic and able to segment gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from brain MRI effectively with sufficient accuracy. Hence, it may be considered to be a potential computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool for radiologists and other medical practitioners in their clinical diagnosis workflow.",

Such tests are used for various objectives, including reformulation and cost reduction. Yet, studies on relative discrimination power and efficiency have been limited to experimental designs with a fixed pair of stimuli and method comparisons based on the same numbers of tests. In the present study, two reminder methods, A-Not A with Reminder (A-Not AR) and 2-AFC with Reminder (2-AFCR), were investigated as potentially better methods for experimental designs including comparisons of multiple pairs of stimuli for consumer discrimination. 2-AFCR is procedurally equivalent to a constant-reference duo-trio test with the reference presented first (DTF) and thus this test is referred to as the constant-ref. DTF/2-AFCR test in this paper. The practical efficiency of these two reminder methods, attributed to their effective stimulus configurations in replicated tests (i.e. using a fixed reference and lower number of different stimuli required in a test), was tested in comparison with the two most commonly used balanced reference classification methods, the triangle test and the unspecified tetrad test, by equalizing the number of stimuli required for the different methods. Namely the relative operational discrimination power was studied based on the same number of stimuli rather than the same number of tests. 180 naïve consumers performed a set of 12 replicated triangle tests and, based on the results, were divided into one of three equally-performing groups. A related-samples design was implemented for comparison between the triangle and the other three methods. An independent-samples design was implemented across the three groups to compare the A-Not AR, constant-ref. DTF/2-AFCR, and unspecified tetrad methods. Statistical ratio comparisons of d′ estimates obtained from different methods revealed that discrimination performance in the reminder methods was better than in both the tetrad and triangle methods. No discrimination difference was found between the triangle and tetrad tests having all possible test sequences, although the triangle test considering only the optimal test sequences, which were the same as those in the constant-ref. DTF/2-AFCR, resulted in superior discrimination than the tetrad test. Collectively, these results suggest that when assessing the discriminability of multiple stimuli from a fixed reference, the reminder scheme is the superior research design.",

Our analysis (covering each single hour of the complete year 2015) shows that production tasks with a highly variable work load, when characterized by binding cost allocation restrictions and high within-traffic-control-centre efficiency, are more prone to human error. Further, we show how DEA combined with disaggregated data can be used to a priori assess staff schedule changes.",1

This paper proposes a novel automatic epileptic EEG classification approach based on differential entropy and attention mechanism, aiming at designing a short-term epileptic EEG classification model with high accuracy and good generalization performance. Firstly, the original EEG recordings are decomposed into five sub-frequency bands which approximately obey the Gaussian distribution. Afterward, a improved attention model framework considering both row and column attention with a shallower VGGNet (AttVGGNet-RC) is put forward as the classifier. Finally, non-patient specific method is employed to evaluate the performance with pre-tuned hypermeters. With 8-fold data, the proposed model yielded 77.33 ± 2.91% sensitivity, 86.67 ± 3.70% specificity and 82.00 ± 1.43% accuracy, and accuracy was increased by 5.34%, 8.99%, 26.24% and 4.47% respectively compared with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with the Spanish National Police Corps (SNPC), defines partitions of the territory under the jurisdiction of a district that are efficient and balanced at the same time, according to the preferences of a decision maker. To analyze the crime records provided by the SNPC, a methodology for the description of spatially and temporally indeterminate crime events has been developed. The DSS has been tested with a case study in the Central District of Madrid. The results of the experiments show that the proposed DSS clearly outperforms the patrolling area definitions currently in use by the SNPC. To compare the solutions in terms of efficiency loss, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the problem considered, which can be used to identify the range of performances associated with different patrolling strategies.",

When adopting such technology, organizations inevitably establish process model collections which, depending on the degree of adoption, can reach sizes of thousands of models. Process model matching techniques are intended to assist experts in the management of such large collections, e.g., in querying the collections and in comparing process models. Yet, as demonstrated in comparative evaluations, existing techniques struggle to achieve a high effectiveness on real-world datasets, limiting their practical applicability. This is partly due to these techniques being fully automated and relying on universal knowledge bases that insufficiently represent the domain semantics of model collections. To increase effectiveness and to progress on the path to practical applicability, we pursue the idea of integrating expert feedback into the matching process, so as to continuously update the knowledge base and achieve a better domain adaptation. In particular, we present ADBOT, a matching technique that relies on expert feedback in terms of corrected matching results. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce different strategies to utilize expert feedback in the matching process and to improve its effectiveness. Second, we provide heuristics for guiding experts through a model collection intended to reduce the amount of collected feedback while still maximizing the gains of learning from it. Based on five separate real-world datasets we provide empirical evidence towards the feasibility of our matcher. In the experiments, ADBOT (i) achieves high f-measures of up to .90, (ii) improves the effectiveness of baseline matchers by up to 88%, (iii) yields high recall values due to the detection of correspondences that automated matchers fail to achieve, and (iv) still increases effectiveness when the feedback contains errors. We also discuss evidence that substantiates ADBOT’s individual components, amongst others demonstrating that the guidance heuristics can maximize effectiveness, while minimizing human effort.",

This is partly attributable to the ongoing workload faced by cyber security professionals, which is compounded by the limited number of qualified personnel and turnover of personnel across organizations. Additionally, it is difficult to conduct research, and particularly, openly published research, due to the sensitivity inherent to cyber operations at most organizations. As an alternative, the current research has focused on data collection during cyber security training exercises. These events draw individuals with a range of knowledge and experience extending from seasoned professionals to recent college graduates to college students. The current paper describes research involving data collection at two separate cyber security exercises. This data collection involved multiple measures which included behavioral performance based on human-machine transactions and a questionnaire-based assessments of cyber security experience. It was found that participants reporting more experience with cyber security topics and cyber security software tools made greater use of general purpose software tools, combining the use of general purpose tools with specialized cyber security software applications. Given that organizations make substantial investments in cyber security software tools, it is important to recognize that while these tools enable specialized analyses that would not be possible otherwise, they are not sufficient. Instead, effective cyber security operations involve a range of activities that extends from the highly general (e.g., taking notes, Internet search) to domain specific (e.g., disk forensics) and the accompanying work environment should accommodates this range of activities.",

However, some of the challenges that are associated with autonomous vehicles are yet to be resolved. Here, we investigate the user dependence on autonomous control in autopilot vehicles. Further, we verify whether drivers can control the vehicles in an appropriate manner after a system failure based on the range of biometric data. The participants in this study experienced three scenarios in a driving simulator: manual-driving, autonomous-driving, and system-failure scenarios, which forced the participants to resume manual control. The data obtained from salivary amylase depict that drivers tend to be anxious while performing the transition from the manual-driving scenario to the autonomous-driving scenario; however, all drivers have to be accustomed with the system in order to drive using a driving simulator. Thus, the difference of anxiety between various drivers is observed to be suppressed. The seat pressure data illustrate that an area having a value equal to 95% of the probability-deviation ellipse during the second day of the manual-driving and autonomous-driving scenarios is observed to have the largest value from among each driving scenario, which seems to be caused due to the driver’s concentration or fatigue. Further, the systolic blood pressures of all the drivers increased with time. However, in the autonomous-driving scenario, the average relative systolic blood pressure is, on the whole, higher than that in the manual-driving scenario. It is suggested that the drivers had never previously used an autonomous-driving system and that he/she may be uncomfortable or uneasy to autonomously control the brake, accelerator, and steering wheel. Additionally, after a system failure during the manual-driving scenario, the behavior is observed to be similar to that in the initial manual-driving scenario, and the totally average relative systolic blood pressure is higher than that during the initial manual-driving scenario. This indicates that the drivers’ mental workload is relatively low during the autonomous-driving scenario because they do not experience any stress from driving. However, the drivers’ systolic blood pressure increased because of the transition from autonomous driving to manual control and because of the mental workload to control the vehicle on their own just after using an autonomous-driving system. From the viewpoint of the brain activity in the left frontal lobe, the data indicates that the drivers’ cognition level during autonomous driving is lower than that during manual driving and that the declining tendency of the average relative hemoglobin concentration is remarkable during the manual-driving scenario after encountering a system failure. This is because the driver feels that he/she may commit mistakes during manual driving. Additionally, if he/she is driving an autonomous vehicle and if the autonomous-driving system failed, he/she does not need to pay attention to the surrounding subjects and control the vehicle. The eye-gaze data indicate that “mind distraction” occurred in the participants while resuming control after a system failure because their brain activity at this instance was relatively low. Our results indicate that drivers who depend on autonomous control systems experience stress upon switching to manual control after a system failure.",

Some of these adverse consequences include bone loss, muscle atrophy, sensory-motor deconditioning, and cardiovascular alteration, which may lead to orthostatic intolerance when astronauts return to Earth. Artificial gravity could provide a comprehensive countermeasure capable of challenging all the physiological systems at once, particularly if combined with exercise, thereby maintaining overall health during extended exposure to weightlessness. A new Compact Radius Centrifuge (CRC) platform was designed and built on the existing Short Radius Centrifuge (SRC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The centrifuge has been constrained to a radius of 1.4 m, the upper radial limit for a centrifuge to fit within an International Space Station (ISS) module without extensive structural alterations. In addition, a cycle ergometer has been added for exercise during centrifugation. The CRC now includes sensors of foot forces, cardiovascular parameters, and leg muscle electromyography. An initial human experiment was conducted on 12 subjects to analyze the effects of different artificial gravity levels (0g, 1g, and 1.4g, measured at the feet) and ergometer exercise intensities (25W warm-up, 50W moderate and 100W vigorous) on the musculoskeletal function as well as motion sickness and comfort. Foot forces were measured during the centrifuge runs, and subjective comfort and motion sickness data were gathered after each session. Preliminary results indicate that ergometer exercise on a centrifuge may be effective in improving musculoskeletal function. The combination is well tolerated and motion sickness is minimal. The MIT CRC is a novel platform for future studies of exercise combined with artificial gravity. This combination may be effective as a countermeasure to space physiological deconditioning.",

Next, we divide the dataset into different subsets according to the statistical analysis and modify formulas found in the literature to estimate the maximum heart rate as well as the maximum power output for each group. Then, we derive formulas from the dataset to estimate the heart rate and power output at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) as well as the heart rate at low workload. A linear curve between these points describes the immediate relationship between heart rate and power. We compared the results of the adapted formulas to the results of the original formulas for experimental data of 15 subjects. The adapted formulas show better results in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and sum of squared residuals (SSR) for estimating the maximum power output, but no improvement in estimating the maximum heart rate. The heart rate at IAT is predicted with a MAE of 9 beats per minute (bpm) and heart rate for low intensity with a MAE of 13 bpm. Power at the IAT is predicted with a MAE of 22 Watts.",

However, the combined effects of work-related factors strain the cardiovascular system, elevating the heart rate of the operator. Our goal was to determine what work-related factors increased the risk of cardiovascular disease of cut-to-length machine operators. We created two generalized linear models. A model consisting of 678 cases, explained 32% of the heart rate variability through the operators' height and weight, machine types, parts of the shifts, lighting, and whole-body vibrations. To identify which factors actually increased the risk of cardiovascular diseases, we assessed a subset (193 cases) of heart rates elevated above 90 beats per minute. We found that the operators’ height, machine types, parts of the shifts, equivalent noise, lighting, and whole-body vibrations explained about 72% of the elevated heart rate variability. The elevated heart rate depended on variables, which can be optimized to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Relevance to industry Cabin field machines are widely used in various industries. Our findings show that factors of the work environment affect the circulatory systems of the operators less than shiftwork. In order to further reduce the effects of work on operators, we should put more focus on improving the work organization.",

The second method was used mechanization index based on energy expenditures of machinery and human labor. The study aim of was to assess the mechanization status in sweet corn cultivation in Malaysia. This paper described the overall mechanization status in the cultivation of sweet corn in Malaysia, and the machinery energy, worker’s energy expenditure, and heart rate for various field operations that were involved in cultivation. The field operations include tillage, planting, fertilizing, spraying, harvesting, and cutting plants. Field capacity, and machinery energy for each of the operations were calculated. The calculated mechanization index was used in the study to describe the mechanization status in sweet corn cultivation. A mean overall mechanization index of 36.49% and aggregate machinery energy of 340.67 ± 41.99 MJ/ha were registered for the crop. Highest mechanization index, and machinery energy were acquired in the tillage operation of 94.09% and 105.35 ± 9.37 MJ/ha while the lowest mechanization index, and machinery energy were in the harvesting operation with bags of 0.83%, and 0.42 ± 0.09 MJ/ha.

Five years on, there is little consensus as to what constitutes high-quality care in MAID. Objectives To describe MAID clinicians' perspectives on quality of care in MAID, including challenges, successes, and clinical practice suggestions. Methods We conducted an exploratory, multicenter, and qualitative study at four Canadian centers. Using a semistructured interview guide, we conducted interviews with 20 health care providers. Interviews were transcribed and deidentified before analysis. Adopting a qualitative descriptive approach, we used a thematic analysis to identify primary and secondary themes in the interviews and practice suggestions to improve quality of care to patients who request MAID. Results We identified three major themes. 1) Improving access and patient experience: clinicians described struggles in ensuring equitable access to MAID and supporting MAID patients and their families. 2) Supporting providers and sustainability: clinicians described managing MAID workload, remuneration, educational needs, and the emotional impact of participating in assisted dying. 3) Institutional support: descriptions of MAID communication tools and training, use of standardized care pathways, interprofessional collaboration, and human resource planning. Clinicians also described suggestions for clinical practice to improve quality of care.

The study found that the initial changes were of seemingly low complexity, yet, follow-on integration required significantly more schedule (years versus months) and cost to implement. Focusing solely on the hardware and its functions revealed a disproportionate increase in complexity for minimal functional gain. However, expanding the system to consider the user revealed a trade-off between user workload and system complexity. The initial system functional gain was achieved by a combination of low complexity hardware modifications and an increase in the aircrew from 6 to 11; the subsequent generation involved extensive hardware integration and reduced aircrew requirements to 7. The existing design literature is quite extensive on the measurement of system complexity, particularly to better control design schedule and cost, with a tight focus on single types of system components (e.g. hardware or software). The literature does not provide a good means to capture this observed exchange that occurred between dissimilar components. In this paper, we present a method for considering the interactions amongst dissimilar system components and the changes in complexity as the system evolves. This method leverages existing Multi-Domain-Matrices (MDM) techniques, but unlike previous work, treats humans-in-the-loop as components that accomplish system functions. To illustrate the utility of this method, it is applied to a toy example, the making of egg foam with culinary hardware of varying complexity. In holding the overall function constant, the analysis method clearly demonstrates an exchange between human and hardware functions as the hardware grew in complexity. Future application of this method will consider more complex systems, specifically the case that drove this line of thought. It is anticipated that application of this method to the case in question will clarify the mechanisms that drove system complexity increases in the second generation aircraft technology. It is also anticipated that this method will aid in the consideration of the trades that occur between dissimilar system components, thus enabling better management of overall system complexity.",

There is need to explore evidence-based, scalable interventions to compliment the “traditional” health care system. Physical activity (PA) can augment the effectiveness of existing programs. However, little is known about the perspectives of health care professionals on PA. Understanding this is key to implementation. Methods This was a qualitative exploratory study based on 13 key informant interviews among experienced health care professionals working at Butabika National Referral and Teaching Hospital, Uganda. Data was analyzed through content thematic analysis. Results Participants reported PA benefits were: improved individual competences and engagement, social reintegration and reduced family and community burden. Self-stigma, lack of community support, lack of infrastructure and equipment, lack of monitoring capacity, human resource challenges and a focus solely on pharmacotherapy were among the most reported barriers to application of PA in management of mental health problems. Conclusion Despite the high level of understanding of PA among health care professionals, PA promotion largely depends on implementation of strategies to deal with community and health systems barriers. Although patients need to be empowered to deal with their individual barriers, greater support and action is needed by policy makers. Public health programs should support PA through community engagement and social re-integration programs. The government should promote a holistic mental health care perspective and provide adequate infrastructural and human resources to support PA in the existing primary and mental health care systems.",

In the future, traffic management will determine optima for speed and safety distances. Wirelessly broadcasted, the question remains how to present this information to drivers in a way that is easily understood and intuitively followed. To this end, a human-machine interface, called distance-speedometer, was first developed according to the principles of ecological interface design and then evaluated in a driving simulator study with forty-nine participants. It presents augmented distances derived from speed in a head-up display. Using a within-subject design, the distance-speedometer and standard speedometer were compared against each other in two scenarios (car-following & sign-following). Each scenario triggered several speed changes. When reacting to speed signs, driving performance did not differ between the two interfaces. However, with the distance-speedometer, visual workload was reduced as more secondary tasks could be completed. When reacting to speed changes of a car ahead, the engagement in the secondary task did not differ significantly between the two interfaces. However, the variance of speed deviations was significantly lower with the distance-speedometer. Results can be explained by the ability to process the distance-speedometer in a skill-based manner, whereas the normal speedometer demands rule-based behaviour to control the speed. With regard to traffic management, the distance-speedometer might be used to unconsciously influence the driver’s choice of speed in order to increase traffic safety and efficiency.",

The artifacts in epileptic EEG strongly affect the detection results, especially in the form of chewing noises. This paper proposes a novel time-domain approach to process chewing noises in epileptic EEG signals based on period segmentation. Firstly, merger of increasing and decreasing sequences (MIDS) is employed to segment EEG periods. This period segmentation approach considers information of waveform rather than a single sample point and applies human vision principle. Experimental results show that the performance of merger and period segmentation is close to clinical visual detection. Secondly, chewing noises are recognized in epilepsy patients׳ EEG following period segmentation. To reduce the false recognition rate, classification results of four channels F3, F4, F7 and F8, which acquire high sensitivity and low false recognition rate, are fused to determine fragments׳ classification by weighting. With this method, EEG recordings of 20 epilepsy patients were analyzed. The results showed that a sensitivity of 98.10% and a false recognition rate of 0.01375/s were achieved. It demonstrates that the proposed approach performs well in automatic recognition of chewing noises in epileptic EEG, which is of crucial importance to automatic detection of IED.",

Cooperative automation is an approach that tries to keep the user in the control loop by means of a continuous interaction during task execution. Cooperative automation aims to support the harmonization of the actor's activities (user and automation) in a human-machine-system. To enable this, both the internal (processing and computation) and external (communications and interfaces) design of the automation has to be compatible with human competence. This contribution addresses the key features of cooperative automation. These features have been used for creating a design space, which can be used as method repository in order to develop assistance systems based on the cognitive capabilities of the human. The key elements are represented as dimensions of the design space. Corresponding theories and methods are discussed. The design process for a cognitive and cooperative assistance system based on the dimensions of the design space are described. The developed Cognitive and Cooperative Assistance System (COGAS), has been implemented in the domain of air target identification on German naval ships. An evaluation of COGAS has been conducted with naval operators in order to verify its operability and to optimize and extend the COGAS functionality. The results show that COGAS improves the operator's performance in terms of increasing the amount of correct decisions and accelerating the identification process without increasing the operator's stress level. In addition it was found that COGAS helps to enhance the situational awareness due to the workload optimization.",

These deposits vary unrelated to obesity, which reinforces its direct segmentation for further quantification. However, manual segmentation of these fats has not been widely deployed in clinical practice due to the required human workload and consequential high cost of physicians and technicians. In this work, we propose a unified method for an autonomous segmentation and quantification of two types of cardiac fats. The segmented fats are termed epicardial and mediastinal, and stand apart from each other by the pericardium. Much effort was devoted to achieve minimal user intervention. The proposed methodology mainly comprises registration and classification algorithms to perform the desired segmentation. We compare the performance of several classification algorithms on this task, including neural networks, probabilistic models and decision tree algorithms. Experimental results of the proposed methodology have shown that the mean accuracy regarding both epicardial and mediastinal fats is 98.5% (99.5% if the features are normalized), with a mean true positive rate of 98.0%. In average, the Dice similarity index was equal to 97.6%.",

It requires searching in huge data sets for candidates, and inferring the most appropriate features based on the information found and expert knowledge. When humans perform most of these tasks, results are of a high quality, but there is a bottleneck in processing; when experts are largely replaced by automated tools, annotation is faster but of poorer quality. Combining the automatic annotation with expert systems (ESs) can enhance the quality of the annotation, while effectively reducing experts’ workload. This paper presents INFAES, a rule-based ES developed for mimicking the human reasoning in the inference stage of the functional annotation. It integrates knowledge on Biology and heuristics about the use of Bioinformatics tools. Its development adopts state-of-the-art methodologies to facilitate the acquisition and integration of new knowledge.

The initial form of operating procedures, paper based procedures (PBP), have some drawbacks such as high operators’ workload and necessity of much time to find and execute procedures related to the events. Therefore, computer based procedures (CBP) were developed to overcome the problems. However, some operators are not familiar with the CBP and may refuse to use the CBP because they used to use the PBP without any problems. This research investigates some features to the CBP to make it easier for operator to use and execute procedures and reducing human error. The proposed features are providing functional information of the procedures steps and related components using multilevel flow modeling (MFM), displaying remaining time for operators to complete each step or group of steps and implementing dynamic operation permission to reduce commission error by operators. The features, integrated with operator support systems, will make the CBP more intelligent and easy to use, especially in emergency condition of nuclear power plants",19

They allow both developers and users to submit problem reports on observed failures. However, by allowing anyone to submit problem reports, it is likely that more than one reporter will report on the same issue. Research in open source repositories has focused on two broad areas: determining the original report associated with each known duplicate, and assigning a developer to fix a particular problem. Objective: Limited research has been done in developing a fully automated triager, one that can first ascertain if a problem report is original or duplicate, and then provide a list of 20 potential matches for a duplicate report. We address this limitation by developing an automated triaging system that can be used to assist human triagers in bug tracking systems. Method: Our automated triaging system automatically assigns a label of original or duplicate to each incoming problem report, and provides a list of 20 suggestions for reports classified as duplicate. The system uses 24 document similarity measures and associated summary statistics, along with a suite of document property and user metrics. We perform our research on a lifetime of problem reports from the Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office repositories. Results: Our system can be used as a filtration aide, with high original recall exceeding 95% and low duplicate recall, or as a triaging guide, with balanced recall of approximately 70% for both originals and duplicates. Furthermore, the system reduces the workload on the triager by over 90%. Conclusions: Our work represents the first full scale effort at automatically triaging problem reports in open source repositories. By utilizing multiple similarity measures, we reduce the potential of false matches caused by the diversity of human language.",

Well-functioning maintenance is a significant factor for a high level of availability. This can be achieved by minimizing the number of reactive maintenance stops and optimizing scheduled maintenance. New methods for predictive maintenance provide a good opportunity for this, but most technologies that are available today are designed for individual sub-systems and they are rarely designed for a complex, interconnected machine. In the process industry, raw materials are processed into a finished product in a continuous flow through several subsystems and if one subsystem stops, the entire process flow stops. For these processes, it is more important to optimize the maintenance efforts for subsystems so maintenance can take place synchronized. This paper describes a method of supervised control that includes maintenance aspects; health parameters indicating deterioration are included in a MIMO controller. The method is verified in a simulation of a rolling mill with three rollers. The results show that it is possible to optimize the whole complex process including several sub-processes by using a health parameter as a control parameter and broadening the controllability of the system by dividing the workload in a way that all the subsystems reach the desired degradation level for maintenance in a desired optimum time.",1

Objective To investigate the effect of PSE support on the reduction in task performance caused by physical fatigue. Methods This experiment consisted of a randomized, counterbalanced cross-over design comparing Exo4Work PSE support and no support, in a physically fatigued state and a control condition. Precision performance was determined using execution speed and drilling errors. Muscle activity and shoulder joint kinematics were recorded. Results Fatigue altered task performance, shoulder joint kinematics, muscle activity and subjective experience during overhead work. The PSE support mitigated the fatigue-induced changes in shoulder kinematics. Additionally, a part of the fatigue-induced co-activation of shoulder stabilizing muscles was avoided when working with the PSE. The PSE support also reduced the activity of the anterior and medial deltoid. Conclusion Physical fatigue provokes compensatory movements and increased co-contraction of muscles when executing overhead work. These fatigue-induced alterations are generally believed to increase the overall musculoskeletal load. The support provided by the PSE reduced muscle activity of muscles working to elevate the arm, but also partially mitigated those fatigue-induced effects. Significance This study shows that the effect of PSE support on precision performance is limited, and suggested that, apart from the known effects of PSE support during overhead work, wearing the exoskeleton in a physically fatigued state may provide additional advantages.",

The familiar VAs were the second best-performing VAs. Though there were no significant differences in the trust in the three designed VAs, participants held positive and cautious attitudes towards VAs in general.

Existing wake measurement techniques can only obtain local high-resolution (HR) wake flow field, or sacrifice accuracy to obtain larger measurement area, which is insufficient for accurate modeling of wake effect. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a novel super-resolution (SR) reconstruction approach that can reconstruct the global HR wake flow field from low-resolution (LR) wake flow field measurement data effectively. The proposed approach utilizes a deep learning framework called down-sampled skip-connection and multi-scale network. The performance of the SR approach is evaluated by enhancing the resolution of the wake flow field at different scale factors, and its potential application is demonstrated by assessing the prediction accuracy of three typical wake models. The results indicate that the resolution of the global wind turbine wake can be improved by 16 times using the SR model, and the reconstructed global SR wake flow fields are consistent with the ground truth in terms of both the spatial distribution and the temporal variation. By comparing the prediction results of three different wake models with the LR or SR wake data, it is shown that the SR flow reconstruction method can be applied to more accurately evaluate the wake model prediction performance, which has the potential to improve wake models. Overall, this study presents an innovative solution to the problem of incomplete and inaccurate wake flow measurement in the wind energy industry, which could reduce the workload of experimental measurements and the cost burden of accurate measuring equipment for engineering applications.",

The analysis was conducted on 15 farmers on their own farms during the morning and evening milking in the tethering and carousel systems while lifting and carrying a full bucket or a sack and while the tractor was moving. The analysis of muscle load was conducted with the surface EMG (Electromyography) system and Job Strain Index method. The highest values of muscle tension and force were observed in the forearm muscles during the attachment of teat cups to the udder. It was connected with lifting the equipment in an uncomfortable posture assumed by the milker. For the tractor driver the ergonomics of the seat and steering wheel was measured. It has been demonstrated that unfavourable working conditions increase the musculoskeletal overload. One of the methods of preventing them is to create appropriate working conditions for a specific person and gender. This will allow each worker to properly adjust the work and to apply specific matching equipment.",

Due to the complexity and diversity of emotions, EEG-based emotion recognition is still a challenging task in pattern recognition. In order to recognize diverse emotions, we propose a novel firefly integrated optimization algorithm (FIOA) in this paper. It can simultaneously accomplish multiple tasks, i.e. the optimal feature selection, parameter setting and classifier selection according to different EEG-based emotion datasets. The FIOA utilizes a ranking probability objection function to guarantee the high accuracy recognition with less features. Moreover, the hybrid encoding expression and the dual updating strategy are developed in the FIOA so as to realize the optimal selection of feature subset and classifier without stagnating in the local optimum. In addition to the public DEAP datasets, we also conducted an EEG-based music emotion experiment involving 20 subjects for the validation of the proposed FIOA. After filtering and segmentation, three categories of features were extracted from every EEG signal. Then FIOA was applied to every subject dataset for two pattern recognition of emotions. The results show that the FIOA can automatically find the optimal features, parameter and classifier for different emotion datasets, which greatly reduces the artificial selection workload. Furthermore, comparing with the binary particle swarm optimization (PSObinary) and the binary firefly (FAbinary), the FIOA can achieve the higher accuracy with less features in the emotion recognition.",

We can find many different initiatives in the USA, Europe and Japan which attempt to achieve such a challenging target. In this work, we focus on the most important European initiative (the Human Brain Project) and on one of the models developed in this project. This tool simulates the spikes triggered in a neural network by computing the voltage capacitance on the neurons’ morphology, being one of the most precise simulators today. In the present work, we have evaluated the use of MPI+OpenMP tasking on top of this framework. We prove that this approach is able to achieve a good scaling even when computing a relatively low workload (number of neurons) per node. One of our targets consists of achieving not only a highly scalable implementation, but also to develop a tool with a high degree of abstraction without losing control and performance by using MPI+OpenMP tasking. The main motivation of this work is the evaluation of this cutting-edge simulation on multi-morphology neural networks. The simulation of a high number of neurons, which are completely different among them, is an important challenge. In fact, in the multi-morphology simulations, we find an important unbalancing between the nodes, mainly due to the differences in the neurons, which causes an important under-utilization of the available resources.

However, because OCT image analysis requires training and it takes time to review OCT images from large skin areas, an automatic evaluation method is preferred to reduce the workload and avoid ‘sampling errors’ during image analysis. Here we report an automatic method to enhance and detect dermal papillae and stratum basale in ultrahigh resolution OCT images.

In this paper, configuration synthesis of an exoskeleton is completed using advanced mechanism theory. To adapt glenohumeral (GH) movements and improve exoskeletal compatibility, six passive joints were introduced into the connecting interfaces based on optimal configuration principles. The optimal configuration of the passive joints can effectively reduce the gravitational influences of the exoskeleton device and the upper extremities. A compatible exoskeleton (Co-Exos) with 11 degrees of freedom was developed while retaining a compact volume. A new approach is presented to compensate vertical GH movements. The theoretical displacements of translational joints were calculated by the kinematic model of the shoulder loop Θs. A comparison of the theoretical and measured results confirms that the passive joints exhibited good human–machine compatibility for GH movements. The hysteresis phenomenon of translational joints appeared in all experiments due to the elasticoplasticity of the upper arm and GH. In comparable experiments, the effective torque of the second active joint was reduced by an average of 41.3% when passive joints were released. The wearable comfort of Co-Exos was thus improved significantly.",

We further aimed to understand how team performance was related to the frequency of intrateam communication during different task phases. Six nuclear fire brigades were video recorded during a simulated scenario and subsequent communication utterances were analysed. According to our results, on the central channel a higher frequency of “Simple answer” was negatively related, while on the lateral channel a higher frequency of “Command” and “Information without request” were positively related to team performance. Our results also indicate that while on the central channel communication frequencies were more balanced across adaptation phases, on the lateral channel there was a significant increase in intrateam communication when the teams entered non-routine phases. Furthermore, our results underline the different functions of the two communication channels: while the central channel supports maintaining contact between geographically dispersed team members with formal, standardised communication formulas, the lateral channel supports the modification of the team's strategy with a simpler, less formal communication mode. Relevance to industry The findings can be applied in nuclear firefighters' training and thereby contribute to the operational safety in nuclear power plants. By becoming more aware of the communication categories that support teamwork during adaptation, as well as of how best to utilise different communication channels, teams’ workload may be decreased, and team resources may be spared for team adaptation.",

As the volume of forecasts increases, for example due to an increased product customisation that leads to more SKUs being traded, or a reduction in the length of the forecasting cycle, there is a pressing need for reliable automated forecasting. Conventionally, companies rely on a statistical baseline forecast that captures only past demand patterns, which is subsequently adjusted by human experts to incorporate additional information such as promotions. Although there is evidence that such process adds value to forecasting, it is questionable how much it can scale up, due to the human element. Instead, in the literature it has been proposed to enhance the baseline forecasts with external well-structured information, such as the promotional plan of the company, and let experts focus on the less structured information, thus reducing their workload and allowing them to focus where they can add most value. This change in forecasting support systems requires reliable multivariate forecasting models that can be automated, accurate and robust. This paper proposes an extension of the recently proposed Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (MAPA), which uses temporal aggregation to improve upon the established exponential smoothing family of methods. MAPA is attractive as it has been found to increase both the accuracy and robustness of exponential smoothing. The extended multivariate MAPA is evaluated against established benchmarks in modelling a number of heavily promoted products and is found to perform well in terms of forecast bias and accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modelling time series using multiple temporal aggregation levels makes the final forecast robust to model mis-specification.",

Specifically, the use of head-tracking in a non-invasive way, without immersive virtual reality devices was combined and compared with classical control modes for robot movements and camera control. Three control conditions were tested: 1) a condition with classical joystick control of both the movements of the robot and the robot camera, 2) a condition where the robot movements were controlled by a joystick and the robot camera was controlled by the user head orientation, and 3) a condition where the movements of the robot were controlled by hand gestures and the robot camera was controlled by the user head orientation. Performance, workload metrics and their evolution as the participants gained experience with the system were evaluated in a series of experiments: for each participant, the metrics were recorded during four successive similar trials. Results shows that the concept of robot camera control by user head orientation has the potential of improving the intuitiveness of robot teleoperation interfaces, specifically for novice users. However, more development is needed to reach a margin of progression comparable to a classical joystick interface.",

Effective visual scanning by the air traffic controller is the main safety concern for human-computer interaction, as the aim of MRTO is a single controller performing air traffic management tasks originally carried out by up to four ATCOs, comprehensively supported by innovative technology. Thirty-two scenarios were recorded and analyzed using an eye tracking device to investigate the above safety concern and the effectiveness of multiple remote tower operations. The results demonstrated that ATCOs' visual scan patterns showed significant task related variation while performing different tasks and interacting with various interfaces on the controller's working position (CWP). ATCOs were supported by new display systems equipped with pan tilt zoom (PTZ) cameras allowing enhanced visual checking of airport surfaces and aircraft positions. Therefore, one ATCO could monitor and provide services for two airports simultaneously. The factors influencing visual attention include how the information is presented, the complexity of that information, and the characteristics of the operating environment. ATCO's attention distribution among display systems is the key human-computer interaction issue in single ATCO performing multiple monitoring tasks.",

An IoT node is a small device and the supplied power is usually provided by batteries. The collected data by IoT nodes will be transferred to a gateway server which may aggregate data and send it to a cloud platform for further data processing. When IoT nodes distribute through a vast area, nodes located far away from the gateway server will need to transfer data through multi-hops to the gateway server. To have a better power consumption and increase node operational time, next forwarding node can be selected with the highest power level among several candidate nodes. In this paper we propose a data transmission model, and develop a next node selection forwarding factor to balance data transmission throughout the network. The proposed model will consider workload in addition to the available power level to select the next forwarding node. Our simulation results show the selected next forwarding node will operate for a longer time even it has a lower power level compared to the other candidate nodes.

Space technology has revolutionized communication mechanisms while creating opportunities for various research areas, including remote sensing (RS)-inspired applications. On the other hand, IoT presents a platform to use the power of the internet over a whole range of devices through a phenomenon known as social IoT. These devices generate a humongous amount of data that requires handling and managing by big data technology incorporated with deep learning techniques to reduce the manual workload of an operator. Moreover, deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented a scope to extract the underlying features from the large-scale input images in providing better solutions for tasks such as automatic road detection that come at the cost of time and memory overhead. In this context, we have proposed a three-layer edge-fog-cloud-based intelligent satellite IoT architecture that uses the superpixel-based CNN approach. At the fog layer, the superpixel-based simple linear iterative cluster (SLIC) algorithm uses the images captured by the satellites of the edge level to produce the smaller-sized superpixel images that can be transferred even in a low bandwidth link. The CNN module at the cloud level is then trained with these superpixel images to predict the road networks from these RS images. Two popular road datasets: the DeepGlobe Road dataset and the Massachusetts Road dataset, have been considered to prove the usefulness of the proposed SLIC-CNN architecture in satellite-based IoT platforms to address the problems like RS image-based road extraction. The proposed architecture achieves better performance accuracy than the classical CNN while reducing the incurred overhead by a noticeable limit.",

COVID-19 can cause serious complications, especially in patients with pre-existing chronic health problems such as diabetes, hypertension, lung cancer, weakened immune systems, and the elderly. The most critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is the rapid diagnosis of infected patients. Computed Tomography (CT), chest X-ray (CXR), and RT-PCR diagnostic kits are frequently used to diagnose the disease. However, due to difficulties such as the inadequacy of RT-PCR test kits and false negative (FN) results in the early stages of the disease, the time-consuming examination of medical images obtained from CT and CXR imaging techniques by specialists/doctors, and the increasing workload on specialists, it is challenging to detect COVID-19. Therefore, researchers have suggested searching for new methods in COVID- 19 detection. In analysis studies with CT and CXR radiography images, it was determined that COVID-19-infected patients experienced abnormalities related to COVID-19. The anomalies observed here are the primary motivation for artificial intelligence researchers to develop COVID-19 detection applications with deep convolutional neural networks. Here, convolutional neural network-based deep learning algorithms from artificial intelligence technologies with high discrimination capabilities can be considered as an alternative approach in the disease detection process. This study proposes a deep convolutional neural network, COVID-DSNet, to diagnose typical pneumonia (bacterial, viral) and COVID-19 diseases from CT, CXR, hybrid CT + CXR images. In the multi-classification study with the CT dataset, 97.60 % accuracy and 97.60 % sensitivity values were obtained from the COVID-DSNet model, and 100 %, 96.30 %, and 96.58 % sensitivity values were obtained in the detection of typical, common pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. The proposed model is an economical, practical deep learning network that data scientists can benefit from and develop. Although it is not a definitive solution in disease diagnosis, it may help experts as it produces successful results in detecting pneumonia and COVID-19.",

However, the introduction of intermittent and non-dispatchable renewable energy generations for powering data centers that generally host time-varying workloads presents a significant challenge, and thus, this study mainly focuses on how to improve renewable energy utilization for data center operations considering the integration of co-located solar power generation and battery energy storage.

However, injury rates are high in climbing populations, especially in the upper extremity and shoulder. Despite likely arising from an arboreal, climbing ancestor and being closely related to primates that are highly proficient climbers, the modern human shoulder has devolved a capacity for climbing. Limited biomechanical research exists on manual climbing performance. This study assessed kinematic and muscular demands during a bimanual climbing task that mimicked previous work on climbing primates. Thirty participants were recruited – 15 experienced and 15 inexperienced climbers. Motion capture and electromyography (EMG) measured elbow, thoracohumeral and trunk angles, and activity of twelve shoulder muscles, respectively, of the right-side while participants traversed across a horizontal climbing apparatus. Statistical parametric mapping was used to detect differences between groups in kinematics and muscle activity. Experienced climbers presented different joint motions that more closely mimicked the kinematics of climbing primates, including more elbow flexion (p = 0.0045) and internal rotation (p = 0.021), and less thoracohumeral elevation (p = 0.046). Similarly, like climbing primates, experienced climbers generally activated the shoulder musculature at a lower percentage of maximum, particularly during the exchange from support to swing and swing to support phase. However, high muscle activity was recorded in all muscles in both participant groups. Climbing experience coincided with a positive training effect, but not enough to overcome the high muscular workload of bimanual climbing. Owing to the evolved primary usage of the upper extremity for low-force, below shoulder-height tasks, bimanual climbing may induce high risk of fatigue-related musculoskeletal disorders.",

Among the physiological metrics, Heart Rate (HR) is reported to be a good indicator of physical stress and workload. HR forecasting models have been used in various areas including cardiopathy research, heart attack warning indicator, and early physical fatigue detection. However, there are no reported studies on HR modeling and forecasting in the construction field. Modeling and forecasting the HR of construction workers using construction field data is of paramount importance due to the direct relationship between activity level and HR. The objective of this study is to (1) analyze the effect of physiological factors including breathing rate, acceleration of torso movements, torso posture, and impulse load on the HR of construction workers, and (2) model and forecast one-minute ahead HR for construction workers based on their physical activity using deep learning algorithms. To this end, physiological metrics of five bridge maintenance workers performing several construction activities were collected. According to the Pearson correlation and entropy based mutual information analysis, time-lagged variables including acceleration of torso movements, torso posture, and impulse load have significant effect on the HR data. The results of deep learning models indicate that Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) have similar predictive performance. However, LSTM had the best overall performance in HR prediction with Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.4, 7.34, and 5.77%, respectively.

This high-performance platform features an x86-based architecture, allowing our implementation to be portable to other common manycore processing machines. This is reinforced by the fact that Phi adopts the popular OpenMP and MPI programming models.

The evaluation leads to an analysis of the neuronal synaptic patterns and their impact on performance when tackling this type of workload on a multinode system. It will be shown that the simulator can calculate 100 ms of simulated brain activity for up to 2 millions of biophysically-accurate neurons and 2 billion neuronal synapses within one minute of execution time.

To evaluate the potential of heat reuse a unique liquid cooled data centre test bench was designed and built. An extensive thermal characterization under different scenarios was performed. The effective liquid cooling capacity is affected by the inlet water temperature. The lower the inlet water temperature the higher the liquid cooling capacity; however, the outlet water temperature will be also low. Therefore, the requirements of the heat reuse application play an important role in the optimization of the cooling configuration. The experimental data was then used to validate a dynamic energy model developed in TRNSYS.

Specifically, this study aimed to investigate whether role conflict, role ambiguity, organizational commitment and subsequent job satisfaction could predict each of the three dimensions of burnout. Design/methodology/approach During current cross sectional, the survey was administered to 232 mental health nurses, employed in four private psychiatric clinics in the region of Larissa, Thessaly, Greece in May 2015. Our findings were based on the responses to 78 usable questionnaires. Different statistical analyses, such as correlation analyses, regression analyses and analyses of variance were performed in order to explore possible relations. Findings High emotional exhaustion (EE) accounted for 53.8% of the sample, while high depersonalization (DP) and high personal accomplishment (PA) accounted for 24.4% and 25.6%, respectively. The best predictors of burnout were found to be role conflict, satisfaction with workload, satisfaction with training, role ambiguity, satisfaction with pay and presence of serious family issues.

The first clinical nutrition units (CNUs) emerged in the public hospitals of the Spanish National Health System (NHS) in the 80s and have gradually been incorporated into the departments of endocrinology and nutrition (DENs). The purpose of our article is to report on the results found in the RECALSEEN study as regards the professional and organizational aspects relating to CNUs and their structure and operation. Materials and methods Data were collected from the RECALSEEN study, a cross-sectional, descriptive study of the DENs in the Spanish NHS in 2016. The survey was compiled from March to September 2017. Qualitative variables were reported as frequency distributions (number of cases and percentages), and quantitative variables as the mean, median, and standard deviation (SD). Results A total of 88 (70%) DENs, out of a total of 125 general acute hospitals of the NHS with 200 or more installed beds, completed the survey. CNUs were available in 83% of DENs (98% in hospitals with 500 or more beds). As a median, DENs had one nurse dedicated to nutrition (35% did not have this resource). Fifty-three percent of DENs with nutrition units had dieticians integrated into the unit (median: 1). DENs located in hospitals with 500 or more beds are more complex and have a wide portfolio of monographic unit services (morbid obesity, 78.3%; artificial home nutrition, 87%; chronic diseases, 65.2%) and specific techniques (impedanciometry, 78%). However, only 14% of the centers perform universal screening tests for malnutrition, and a secondary diagnosis of malnutrition only appears in 12.3 reports per 1000 hospital discharges. Discussion After the 1997 and 2003 studies, the results of 2017 show a marked growth and consolidation of CNUs within the DENs in most hospitals. Today, the growth of this specialty is largely due to the care demand created by hospital clinical nutrition. CNUs still have an insufficient nursing staff and dietitians/nutritionists, and in the latter case, atypical contracts or grants funded by research projects or the pharmaceutical industry are common. Units for specific nutritional diseases and participation in multidisciplinary groups, quite heterogeneous, are concentrated in hospitals with 500 or more beds and represent an excellent opportunity for CNU development. Conclusions Many DENs of Spanish hospitals include CNUs where care is provided by endocrinologists, who devote most of their time to clinical nutrition in more than half of the hospitals. This is most common in large centers with a high workload in relation to staffing. There is considerable heterogeneity between hospitals in terms of both the number and type of activity of the CNUs. Resumen Introducción La nutrición artificial (NA) es uno de los ejemplos más representativos de programas terapéuticos coordinados, lo que hace necesario su desarrollo y adecuada organización. Las primeras Unidades de Nutrición Clínica (UNC) surgen en los hospitales públicos del Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS) en la década de 1980–1990 y se han ido incorporando progresivamente a los Servicios de Endocrinología y Nutrición (SªEyN). El objeto de nuestro artículo es exponer los resultados obtenidos del estudio RECALSEEN sobre los aspectos profesionales y organizativos relacionados con las UNC, su estructura y funcionamiento. Material y métodos Los datos se han obtenido del estudio RECALSEEN, que es un descriptivo transversal entre los SºEyN del SNS español referido a 2016. La encuesta se recogió de marzo a septiembre de 2017. Las variables cualitativas se describen con su distribución de frecuencias (número de casos y porcentajes) y las variables de cuantitativas con la media, mediana y desviación estándar. Resultados Se han obtenido 88 (70%) respuestas de SºEyN sobre un total de 125 hospitales generales de agudos del SNS con igual o más de 200 camas instaladas. El 83% de Sº EyN incorporaban una UNC (98% en los hospitales de 500 o más camas). Como mediana, los Sº EyN tienen 1 enfermera dedicada a Nutrición (35% no disponían de este recurso). El 53% de Sº EyN con Unidad de Nutrición tenían dietistas integrados en la unidad (mediana: 1). Los Sº EyN situadas en hospitales de 500 o más camas tienen una mayor complejidad con una amplia cartera de servicios de unidades monográficas (obesidad mórbida —78,3%—, nutrición artificial domiciliaria —87%—, enfermedades crónicas —65,2%—) y de técnicas específicas (impedanciometría —78%—). Sin embargo, sólo se realiza un test de cribado universal de desnutrición en el 14% de los centros y, el diagnóstico secundario de desnutrición, únicamente aparece en 12,3 informes por cada 1.000 altas hospitalarias. Discusión Tras los estudios de 1997 y 2003, los resultados de 2017 arrojan un notable crecimiento y consolidación de las UNC dentro de los SºEyN de la mayoría de los hospitales. Actualmente, el crecimiento de la especialidad pasa en buena medida por la demanda asistencial que crea la Nutrición Clínica hospitalaria. La dotación de personal de enfermería y de dietistas-nutricionistas en las UNC sigue siendo insuficiente y, en este último caso, son frecuentes los contratos atípicos, o becas financiadas por proyectos de investigación o por la industria farmacéutica. La presencia de unidades para patologías nutricionales específicas y la participación en grupos multidisciplinares, bastante heterogénea, se concentra en hospitales de 500 o más camas y constituye una excelente oportunidad de desarrollo para las UNC. Conclusiones La incorporación de UNC en los S◦EyN es amplia en los hospitales de España, y la asistencia se realiza por endocrinólogos que dedican la mayor parte de su tiempo a la nutrición clínica en más de la mitad de los hospitales. Esta circunstancia es más común en centros grandes, con elevadas cargas de trabajo en relación con las dotaciones de personal. Se observa una considerable heterogeneidad entre los hospitales, tanto en términos de número como de tipo de actividad de las UNC.",5

However, automated steps for multi-omics analyses and interpretation of histological images have not yet been implemented in mass spectrometry data analysis workflows. The characterization of molecular properties within cellular and histological features is done via time-consuming, non-objective, and irreproducible definitions of regions of interest, which are often accompanied by a loss of spatial resolution due to mass spectra averaging. Methods: We developed a new imaging pipeline called Spatial Correlation Image Analysis (SPACiAL), which is a computational multimodal workflow designed to combine molecular imaging data with multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC). SPACiAL allows comprehensive and spatially resolved in situ correlation analyses on a cellular resolution. To demonstrate the method, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) imaging mass spectrometry of metabolites and multiplex IHC staining were performed on the very same tissue section of mouse pancreatic islets and on human gastric cancer tissue specimens. The SPACiAL pipeline was used to perform an automatic, semantic-based, functional tissue annotation of histological and cellular features to identify metabolic profiles. Spatial correlation networks were generated to analyze metabolic heterogeneity associated with cellular features. Results: To demonstrate the new method, the SPACiAL pipeline was used to identify metabolic signatures of alpha and beta cells within islets of Langerhans, which are cell types that are not distinguishable via morphology alone. The semantic-based, functional tissue annotation allows an unprecedented analysis of metabolic heterogeneity via the generation of spatial correlation networks. Additionally, we demonstrated intra- and intertumoral metabolic heterogeneity within HER2/neu-positive and -negative gastric tumor cells. Conclusions: We developed the SPACiAL workflow to provide IHC-guided in situ metabolomics on intact tissue sections. Diminishing the workload by automated recognition of histological and functional features, the pipeline allows comprehensive analyses of metabolic heterogeneity. The multimodality of immunohistochemical staining and extensive molecular information from imaging mass spectrometry has the advantage of increasing both the efficiency and precision for spatially resolved analyses of specific cell types. The SPACiAL method is a stepping stone for the objective analysis of high-throughput, multi-omics data from clinical research and practice that is required for diagnostics, biomarker discovery, or therapy response prediction.",

Specifically, a relative measurement of physical demands, which is a percentage of HR reserve (%HRR), is convenient and useful by normalizing individual differences of HR. Since affordable HR monitoring using wearable devices (particularly, a comfortable wristband-type device: wristband hereafter) becomes available, %HRR-based physical demand measurement, which can be continuously calculated without interfering with workers' ongoing work, provides an enormous potential to protect workers' safety and health and to sustain expected productivity. This research investigates the usefulness of affordable %HRR-based physical demand measurement using a wristband from a case study of 19 workers in construction sites. The aim of the analysis is to examine the potential of this continuous measurement in capturing any significant physical demand variations, by investigating in-depth information on factors affecting physical demands (e.g., work tasks, individual and environmental factors). The results show that workers' physical demands are highly variable according to their working patterns (i.e., direct work, and indirect work including tool/equipment/material handling, traveling, and preparatory work), combined influences of work tasks, as well as individual and environmental factors (e.g., age and heat stress). These results demonstrate the need for continuous physical measurement during workers' ongoing work so that any significant high physical demands, which need to be avoided if possible, can be captured. The findings of this paper show that the continuous measurement of physical demands using a wristband provides rich information to understand, manage, and design physically demanding construction work (e.g., flexible work-rest cycle and managing demanding indirect work) by balancing workloads throughout a day and/or reducing unnecessary physical demands beyond direct work. By anticipating potential health and safety problems from excessive physical demands, as well as productivity loss before they occur, this research will have an ameliorative impact across the construction industry.",

The clinical trials that are undertaken to assess medicine efficacy and safety prior to marketing, generally, may provide sufficient samples for discovering common ADEs. However, more samples are needed to detect infrequent and rare events. Additionally, clinical trials may not include all subgroups of patients. For these reasons, post-marketing surveillance of medicines is necessary for identifying drug safety issues. Most regulatory agencies use the Spontaneous Reporting Systems to identify associations between medicines and suspected ADEs. Data mining with effective analytical frameworks and large-scale medical data is potentially an alternative method to discover and monitor ADEs. In the present paper, we aim to detect potential ADEs from prescription data by discovering ADE associated prescription sequences. In an ADE associated prescription sequence 〈Dp→Ds〉, the prior medicine Dp leads to an ADE for which the succeeding medicine Ds is dispensed to treat. We propose a data-driven method which integrates (1) a constrained sequential pattern mining to uncover prescription sequences as potential signals of ADEs, (2) domain constraints to eliminate interference signals and (3) an adapted Self-Controlled Case Series model to evaluate the potential signals of ADEs. Despite ample prior works using Electronic Health Records (EHRs), our method utilises pure prescription data which does not contain additional information, e.g. symptoms or diagnoses as included in EHRs. To assess the performance of the proposed method, we apply it to a real-world dataset from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of Australia. The dataset contains over 50 million records covering approximately 2 million patients. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying both known ADEs and unknown yet suspicious ADEs with limited detection of false positive signals. Comparing to a recognised gold standard, our method successfully detects 67.4% of the positive adverse events while only 8.78% false positives exist.",

Nevertheless, one major challenge lies in the safe and comfortable transitions of control from the automated system back to the human drivers, especially when they have been inattentive during highly automated driving. In this study, we investigated truck drivers’ take-over response times after a system initiated request to take back control in non-critical truck platooning scenarios. 22 professional truck drivers participated in the truck driving simulator experiment and everyone was instructed to drive under three task conditions during highly automated driving: Driver monitoring condition (drivers were instructed to monitor the surroundings), Driver not-monitoring condition (drivers were provided with a hand-held tablet and were asked to use this), and Eyes-closed condition (drivers were not allowed to open their eyes). The total take-over response time was divided into the perception response time and the movement response time by manual video annotation. Results showed significantly longer total take-over times with high variability in both Driver not-monitoring and Eyes-closed conditions compared to the Driver monitoring condition. Hand movement response time was found to be the dominant component of the total take-over time, being influenced by the motoric manoeuvres to resume physical readiness before taking over control (e.g., putting away the hand-held tablet, or adjusting seating position). These results suggest the importance of a personalized driver readiness predictor as an input parameter for a safe and comfortable transition of control.",

Employing a secondary device with the touchscreen may reduce the demand but there is some debate about which device is most suitable, with current manufacturers favouring different solutions and applying these internationally. We present an empirical driving simulator study, conducted in the UK and China, in which 48 participants undertook typical in-vehicle tasks utilising either a touchscreen, rotary-controller, steering-wheel-controls or touchpad. In both the UK and China, the touchscreen was the most preferred/least demanding to use, and the touchpad least preferred/most demanding, whereas the rotary-controller was generally favoured by UK drivers and steering-wheel-controls were more popular in China. Chinese drivers were more excited by the novelty of the technology, and spent more time attending to the devices while driving, leading to an increase in off-road glance time and a corresponding detriment to vehicle control. Even so, Chinese drivers rated devices as easier-to-use while driving, and felt that they interfered less with their driving performance, compared to their UK counterparts. Results suggest that the most effective solution (to maximise performance/acceptance, while minimising visual demand) is to maintain the touchscreen as the primary control interface (e.g. for top-level tasks), and supplement this with a secondary device that is only enabled for certain actions; moreover, different devices may be employed in different cultural markets. Further work is required to explore these recommendations in greater depth (e.g. during extended or real-world testing), and to validate the findings and approach in other cultural contexts.",

This suggests the need to aggregate results via a clustering method. However, standard unsupervised clustering algorithms like K-means (i) ignore relevance scores that can help with the extraction of highly relevant clusters, and (ii) do not necessarily optimize search results for purposes of visual presentation. In this article, we address both deficiencies by framing the clustering problem for search-driven user interfaces in a novel optimization framework that (i) aims to maximize the relevance of aggregated content according to cluster-based extensions of standard information retrieval metrics and (ii) defines clusters via constraints that naturally reflect interface-driven desiderata of spatial, temporal, and keyword coherence that do not require complex ad-hoc distance metric specifications as in K-means. After comparatively benchmarking algorithmic variants of our proposed approach – RadiCAL – in offline experiments, we undertake a user study with 24 subjects to evaluate whether RadiCAL improves human performance on visual search tasks in comparison to K-means clustering and a filtered search baseline. Our results show that (a) our binary partitioning search (BPS) variant of RadiCAL is fast, near-optimal, and extracts higher-relevance clusters than K-means, and (b) clusters optimized via RadiCAL result in faster search task completion with higher accuracy while requiring a minimum workload leading to high effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction among alternatives.",

The decision-making strategy is uniform for each group of cancer patients, e.g. prostate cancer, and can thus be automated. Predefined priorities and aspiration levels are assigned to each objective, and the strategy is to attain these levels in order of priority. Therefore, a straightforward lexicographic approach is sequential ϵ-constraint programming where objectives are sequentially optimised and constrained according to predefined rules, mimicking human decision-making. The clinically applied 2-phase ϵ-constraint (2pϵc) method captures this approach and generates clinically acceptable treatment plans. However, the number of optimisation problems to be solved for the 2pϵc method, and hence the computation time, scales linearly with the number of objectives. To improve the daily planning workload and to further enhance radiation therapy, it is extremely important to reduce this time. Therefore, we developed the lexicographic reference point method (LRPM), a lexicographic extension of the reference point method, for generating a treatment plan by solving a single optimisation problem. The LRPM processes multiple a priori defined reference points into modified partial achievement functions. In addition, a priori bounds on a subset of the partial trade-offs can be imposed using a weighted sum component. The LRPM was validated for 30 randomly selected prostate cancer patients. While the treatment plans generated using the LRPM were of similar clinical quality to those generated using the 2pϵc method, the LRPM decreased the average computation time from 12.4 to 1.2 minutes, a speed-up factor of 10.",1

Currently, laser scanning is widely used in forestry inventories to acquire three-dimensional (3D) structural information. There are three main data-acquisition modes in ground-based forest measurements: single-scan terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), multi-scan TLS and multi-single-scan TLS. Nevertheless, each of these modes causes specific difficulties for forest measurements. Due to occlusion effects, the single-scan TLS mode provides scans for only one side of the tree. The multi-scan TLS mode overcomes occlusion problems, however, at the cost of longer acquisition times, more human labor and more effort in data preprocessing. The multi-single-scan TLS mode decreases the workload and occlusion effects but lacks the complete 3D reconstruction of forests. These problems in TLS methods are largely avoided with mobile laser scanning (MLS); however, the geometrical peculiarity of forests (e.g., similarity between tree shapes, placements, and occlusion) complicates the motion estimation and reduces mapping accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method combining single-scan TLS and MLS for forest 3D data acquisition. We use single-scan TLS data as a reference, onto which we register MLS point clouds, so they fill in the omission of the single-scan TLS data. To register MLS point clouds on the reference, we extract virtual feature points that are sampling the centerlines of tree stems and propose a new optimization-based registration framework. In contrast to previous MLS-based studies, the proposed method sufficiently exploits the natural geometric characteristics of trees. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and accuracy of the proposed method on three datasets, from which we extract structural information. The experimental results show that the omission of tree stem data caused by one scan can be compensated for by the MLS data, and the time of the field measurement is much less than that of the multi-scan TLS mode. In addition, single-scan TLS data provide strong global constraints for MLS-based forest mapping, which allows low mapping errors to be achieved, e.g., less than 2.0 cm mean errors in both the horizontal and vertical directions.",

NPC is frequently detected in Southeast Asia, particularly in the southern part of China, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand. Problem The diagnostic procedure of NPC entirely depends on the Physicians experience and involves multiple subjective decisions. Subjective decision-making can result in inter and intra observer variations. Inter-observer variation is the total difference obtained from the results of two and above observers when scrutinizing similar materials. Variation amongst the observers is the total difference an observer experience when spotting the same material many times. Tradition diagnostic of NPC has many limitations such as the time consuming for doctors to identify and recognize the tumor area slice by slice and reduce radiologists’ workloads. In addition, another challenge lies in the appearance of doctors used the observation of human eyes (human errors) in NPC cases can be missed detailed information. Approach A novel approach to automatic segmentation plus initial seed generated without human intervention of nasopharyngeal carcinoma using region growing based technique from microscopy images is presented in this study by take advantage of geometric features to detection of NPC images. In order to get accurate region of NPC image, the proposed results utilize wavelet transform for image enhancement by reduce the noise by remove the high ratio sub-bands and predestine a developed NPC image. Segmentation steps including many phases. Firstly, the thresholding is mean value used to binarise the image and secondly, filtering or remove unwanted objects in the images. Finding The findings outcome from this study have shown that: (1) a new adaptive threshold is used as a post-processing to at long last detect the NPC; (2) identified and established an evaluation criterion for automatic segmentation of NPC cases; (3) highlight the methods, based on region growing based technique and active contour operation, for selecting the best region; (4) assessed the performance of the proposed results by comparing the manual measurements and automatic NPC segmentation. The NPC segmentation rate in the technique used is about 83.89%.

Both towns struggle with high unemployment in the aftermath of industry closure, and are characterized by an abundance of affordable housing. Many of the challenges that care providers face and that patients experience are well-documented in Canadian and international literature on rural and remote health, and health care in resource towns (e.g. lack of specialized care, difficulty with recruitment and retention of care providers, heavy workload for existing care providers). However, our study also documents the recent in-migration of low-income, largely working-age people with complex chronic conditions who are drawn to the region by the low cost of housing. We discuss the ways in which the needs of these in-migrants compound existing challenges to rural primary care provision. To our knowledge, our study is the first to document both this migration trend, and the implications of this for primary care. In the interest of patient health and care provider well-being, existing health and social services will likely need to be expanded to meet the needs of these in-migrants.",

This is particularly true for the large-scale adoption of cloud computing and MapReduce in industry, while it has been difficult for traditional high-performance computing (HPC) usage in scientific and engineering computing to exploit this type of resources. However, with the strong trend of increasing parallelism rather than faster processors, a growing number of applications target parallelism already on the algorithm level with loosely coupled approaches based on sampling and ensembles. While these cannot trivially be formulated as MapReduce, they are highly amenable to throughput computing. There are many general and powerful frameworks, but in particular for sampling-based algorithms in scientific computing there are some clear advantages from having a platform and scheduler that are highly aware of the underlying physical problem. Here, we present how these challenges are addressed with combinations of dataflow programming, peer-to-peer techniques and peer-to-peer networks in the Copernicus platform. This allows automation of sampling-focused workflows, task generation, dependency tracking, and not least distributing these to a diverse set of compute resources ranging from supercomputers to clouds and distributed computing (across firewalls and fragile networks). Workflows are defined from modules using existing programs, which makes them reusable without programming requirements. The system achieves resiliency by handling node failures transparently with minimal loss of computing time due to checkpointing, and a single server can manage hundreds of thousands of cores e.g. for computational chemistry applications.",

The use of an automated computer aided diagnosis system will reduce the time taken for analysis and will also reduce the inter-observer subjective variabilities in image interpretation. In this work, we propose one such system for the automatic classification of normal from abnormal (DR, AMD, glaucoma) images. We had a total of 404 normal and 1082 abnormal fundus images in our database. As the first step, 2D-Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) decomposition on the fundus images of two classes was performed. Subsequently, energy features and various entropies namely Yager, Renyi, Kapoor, Shannon, and Fuzzy were extracted from the decomposed images. Then, adaptive synthetic sampling approach was applied to balance the normal and abnormal datasets. Next, the extracted features were ranked according to the significances using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

The lack of structure and defined responsibilities, thus, demands an expert to manually process the requirements. Here, the possibility to improve the usual workflow with machine learning algorithms is explored. The whole requirements management process has two major bottlenecks, which can be automatized. The first one, detecting changes, can be accomplished via a document comparison tool. The second one, recognizing the responsibilities and assigning them to the right department, can be solved with standard machine learning algorithms.

The proposed method improves the requirements management process by reducing an expert’s workload and thus decreasing the time for processing one document was reduced from 2 weeks to 1 h. Moreover, the method gives a high accuracy of department assignment and can self-improve once implemented into a requirements management system.

Results indicated no significant difference between observed and estimated Flex–HR parameters and between measured and estimated V˙O2 in the overall HR range, and separately in different HR ranges. The ANFIS prediction model (MAE = 3 ml kg−1 min−1) demonstrated better performance than Rennie et al.'s (MAE = 7 ml kg−1 min−1) and Keytel et al.'s (MAE = 6 ml kg−1 min−1) models, and comparable performance with the standard Flex–HR method (MAE = 2.3 ml kg−1 min−1) throughout the HR range. The ANFIS model thus provides practitioners with a practical, cost- and time-efficient method for V˙O2 estimation without the need for individual calibration.",

Methods In order to achieve the objectives of this research, two sequential studies were conducted. The first part was an acclimatization and training program followed by a psychophysical experiment. Seven male workers participated in this experiment from the university. A three-way repeated measures design, with three independent variables and seven response variables, was utilized in this study. The independent variables studied in the psychophysical experiment were: 1) environmental temperature (20 and 30 °C WBGT), 2) lifting frequency (1 and 5 lifts/min), and 3) safety shoes (light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty). The response variables for this experiment were: 1) maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWL), 2) heart rate, 3) aural-canal temperature, 4) muscle electromyography (EMG) of four muscle groups (biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, trapezius, and erector spinae), 5) rating of perceived exertion, 6) rating of thermal sensation and7) safety shoes discomfort rating. Results The psychophysical experiment results showed that the weights selected by participants at higher levels of the independent variables were significantly less than those selected at lower levels of the independent variables. Some of the interaction effects were also significant. Conclusion This study found evidence that – in addition to lifting frequency, which is well reported in the literature – heat stress increases the workload intensity in manual lifting tasks influencing the psychophysical selection of MAWL and the physiological responses of the human body represented in aural-canal temperature, heart rate and muscular activities. The study findings demonstrated the necessity of accounting for work environmental temperature and type of worn safety shoes, which is a safety requirement by most employers, when calculating the recommended weight limits. Practitioner summary Most of the manual materials handling studies had investigated worker's capacity to perform lifting tasks in different environmental conditions not considering the effect of wearing safety shoes. This research fills the gap by presenting safety guidelines regarding lifting tasks in a hot environment while wearing safety shoes.",

In practice, the workload is huge, resource consumption is large, measurement takes a long time, and it is easily influenced by human factors. As such, manual estimation of bone age takes a long time and the results fluctuate greatly depending on the proficiency of the radiologist. Methods The left-hand X-ray image data was identified and pre-processed. X-ray image analysis method using on deep neural network was used to automatically extract the key features of the left-hand joint bone age, and evaluation performance of the model was implemented. Results In this paper, the deep learning method can be used to obtain the X-ray bone image features, and the convolutional neural network is used to automatically assess the age of bone. The feature region extraction method based on deep learning can extract feature information with superior performance compared to the traditional image analysis technique. Based on the residual network (ResNet) model in the deep learning algorithm, the average absolute error of the age of bones detected by the bone age assessment model is 0.455 better than traditional methods and only end-to-end deep learning methods. When the learning rate is greater than 0.0005, the MAE of Inception Resnet v2 model is higher than most models. Accuracy of bone age prediction is as high as 97.6%. Conclusion In comparison with the traditional machine learning feature extraction technique, the convolutional neural network based on feature extraction has better performance in the bone age regression model, and further improves the accuracy of image-based age of bone assessment.",

In the past, the diagnosis of early gear pitting faults has usually been carried out under single gear health state. In order to diagnose the early gear pitting faults with mixed operating conditions and reduce the number of training parameters, a new method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method uses an adaptive 1D separable convolution with residual connection network to classify gear pitting faults with mixed operating conditions. Compared to the traditional convolutional neural network, the separable convolution with residual connection network can carry out the channel convolution with point-by-point convolution to effectively reduce the number of network parameters. The residual connection can solve the representational bottleneck problem of the features in the model. Moreover, the method proposed in this paper applies the search algorithm to select better hyperparameters of the model. The raw vibration signals of the gear pitting faults at different speeds collected in a gear test rig are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can accurately diagnose the early gear pitting faults with mixed speeds. In comparison with other machine learning models, the proposed method has provided a better diagnostic accuracy with fewer model parameters.",

Such models enable us to simulate under which conditions perception errors and risk-taking lead to interactions that result in unsafe traffic conditions and ultimately accidents. In this paper, we present a generic multi-level microscopic traffic modelling and simulation framework that supports this important line of research. In this framework, the driving task is modeled in a multi-layered fashion. At the highest level, we have idealized (collision-free) models for car following and other driving tasks. These models typically contain HF parameters that exogenously “govern the human factor”, such as reaction time, sensitivities to stimuli, desired speed, etc. At the lowest level, we define HF variables (task demand and capacity, awareness) with which we maintain what the information processing costs are of performing driving tasks as well as non-driving related tasks such as distractions. We model these costs using so-called fundamental diagrams of task demand. In between, we define functions that govern the dynamics of the high-level HF parameters with these HF variables as inputs. When total task demand increases beyond task capacity, first awareness may deteriorate, where we use Endsley's three-level awareness construct to differentiate between effects on perception, comprehension, anticipation and reaction time. Secondly, drivers may adapt their response in line with Fullers risk allostasis theory to reduce risk to acceptable levels. This framework can be viewed as a meta model, that provides the analyst possibilities to combine and mix a wide variety of microscopic models for driving behavior at different levels of sophistication, depending on which HF are studied, and which phenomena need to be reproduced. We illustrate the framework with a distraction (rubbernecking) case. Our results show that the framework results in endogenous mechanisms for inter- and intra-driver differences in driving behavior and can generate multiple plausible HF mechanisms to explain the same observable traffic phenomena and congestion patterns that arise due to the distraction. We believe our framework can serve as a valuable tool in testing hypotheses related to the effects of HF on traffic efficiency and traffic safety in a systematic way for both the traffic flow and HF community.",

A number of phone applications have been developed with the intention of utilising the technology to prevent dangerous phone behaviours while driving. Despite the potential these applications have in preventing crashes associated with distracted driving, research is yet to explore these emergent applications. Therefore, this study provided a review of the current smartphone applications developed to prevent distracted driving. A content analysis was conducted to identify the smartphone applications targeted at stopping, preventing or reducing phone use behaviour while driving. Their functionality was determined based on the ecosystem of smartphone applications: application-mobile phone interaction, application-driver interaction, and application-context interaction. A total of 29 relevant applications in English language were identified. Most of these applications focused on blocking specific phone functions (e.g. texting or calling) while allowing more desirable driving phone functions to be accessed (e.g. music applications and GPS functions). The specific functions which are blocked or allowed varied greatly between applications. Out of the different application interactions, the function which sends an automatic text message to a contact who texts the driver (associated with external communicator interactions) was the most common feature. A major limitation of the applications was their reliance on blocking specific phone functions as opposed to managing workload while driving or simplifying specific phone tasks to be more compatible with driving. Simply blocking phone functions may not be attractive to drivers who view their phone as a necessity. As such, these drivers are unlikely to use these voluntary applications at all while driving. Smartphone applications designed to prevent phone use while driving show potential for playing a large role in a systemic intervention to prevent mobile phone distracted driving, yet there is a substantial need for further development of these applications.",

Left unaddressed, such stress contributes to burn-out and job turnover, with negative effects on client families as well as agencies and the workers themselves. In response to this problem, some child and family service organizations have encouraged the use of self-care practices to counteract the inherent stresses of these jobs. The present study reports on descriptions of stress and self-care contained in written portfolios of 99 family workers enrolled in a strength-based training program, the Family Development Credential®. As found in other research, virtually all study participants reported an over-arching sense of stress and anxiety, with specific issues of workload, client problems, and work/family imbalance most frequently mentioned. To deal with their stress, workers described a variety of self-care practices: most common were mindfulness, exercise, social connections, changing self-expectations, and time management. Results show a significant curvilinear relationship between the number of stresses and the number of self-care practices mentioned, such that workers discussing both the lowest and the highest number of stresses discussed fewer self-care practices than workers naming a moderate number of stresses. Although a similar relationship between the level of stress and individuals' ability to take advantage of available resources has been demonstrated for low-income families, to our knowledge the present study is the first empirical demonstration of this principle for people who serve such families. These findings illustrate the limits of individual self-care for dealing with high levels of stress, and suggest the importance of strengthening worker support at the agency level, as well as tailoring stress management programs to the needs of individual workers.",

To remain coordinated, team members need to be aware of others' activities if those activities are likely to affect their own actions. However, identifying such interactions and sharing information appropriately is challenging, especially when the activities of team members are loosely-coupled. In practice, team members often either lack important information about others' activities, or are overwhelmed by the need to review too much information. This paper presents Personalized Change Awareness, a new approach for supporting team coordination which aims to automatically identify and share the subset of information about others' activities that is most relevant to each of the team members. The paper formally defines the computational problem of information sharing in loosely-coupled teamwork, which underlies the personalized change awareness approach. It defines a new representation, Mutual Influence Potential Networks (MIP-Nets) and an algorithm, MIP-DOI, that uses this representation to determine the information that is most relevant to each team member. In contrast to existing information sharing algorithms in multi-agent teams, MIP-DOI does not assume the availability of a priori knowledge of a team's possible plans, because human teams rarely explicitly define detailed long-term plans in advance. We demonstrate the ability of MIP-DOI to identify relevant information using simulations of collaborative activities. We further evaluated the contribution of personalized change awareness to team performance in a controlled user study. To this end, we developed a personalized change awareness mechanism for collaborative writing, which used MIP-DOI to determine which changes to share with each author. This evaluation demonstrates that the Personalized Change Awareness approach resulted in higher productivity and lower perceived workload without any change in final quality compared to the currently prevalent approach of sharing all change information. Our results also demonstrate that merely reducing the amount of information shared with co-authors is not enough: sharing a random subset of changes resulted in significantly lower quality of work than sharing a personalized subset of changes.",

Hence the need for a “holistic” approach towards MSD prevention. On the other hand, considering the widespread presence of these factors and of WMSDs in many work places located in both developed and developing countries, there is a strong demand from OSH agencies and operators for “simple” risk assessment and management tools that can also be used by non-experts. Objectives This paper is one of the main contributions towards a WHO/IEA project for developing a “Toolkit for WMSD prevention” by the TC on MSD of the IEA. The paper focuses on selecting tools at different levels for hazard identification, risk estimation and management. The proposals were primarily developed in this context but they also derive from other converging issues such as the ISO TR 12295 – published in 2014. Methods and criteria Proposals are based on two essential criteria: 1) adoption of a step-by-step approach starting with basic tools and moving to more complex tools only when necessary; 2) factoring in complexity and the presence of multiple influencing factors at every step (although with different degrees of in-depth analysis). Results The proposals include: Step one: identification of preliminary occupational hazards and priority setting via “key-enter” questions (at this step, all potential hazards affecting WMSDs should be considered). Step two: identification of risk factors for WMSDs, consisting of a “quick assessment” and substantially aimed at identifying three possible conditions: acceptable/no consequences; critical/redesign urgently needed; more detailed analysis required. Step three: recognized tools for estimating risk (of WMSDs) are used depending on the outcomes of step two. Examples of such tools include “adaptations” of the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation, Liberty Mutual Psychophysical Tables, OCRA Checklist, etc. These tools should adequately cover most of the influencing factors. Relevance to industry The use of a step-by-step approach and validated risk estimation tools, in accordance with international standards, makes it possible to tackle the challenge of simplifying complexity in the assessment of biomechanical overload conditions and in the prevention of WMSDs in enterprises of all sizes, small businesses, agriculture, and in developing countries.",

Yet, ECE remains under-utilized by children in the child welfare system. This study illuminates some of the reasons for this by presenting findings from a series of ten focus groups with child welfare workers, ECE providers, and parents/caregivers of young children involved with the child welfare system (N=78). Fourteen themes emerged regarding organizational and system-level barriers to enrolling children involved with the child welfare system in ECE. These include generic barriers to inter-agency collaboration in human services, such as challenging work climates characterized by limited resources, high workloads and staff turnover, and lack of guidelines for collaborative infrastructure. Findings more specific to inter-agency collaboration between child welfare and ECE include the disruptive effect of foster placement changes and case closures on ECE stability, policies restricting ECE eligibility and availability for birth and/or foster parents, and child welfare workers' limited understanding of the value of high quality, learning based ECE programs versus custodial child care, particularly for infants and toddlers. Policy and practice recommendations to improve ECE utilization and service coordination among child welfare and ECE organizations are discussed.",

This study evaluated a Critical Care Information System implementation. Methods A case study summative evaluation was conducted, employing observation, interview, and document analysis in operating theatres and 16-bed adult intensive care units in a 400-bed Malaysian tertiary referral centre from the perspectives of users (nurses and physicians), management, and information technology staff. System implementation, factors influencing adoption, fit between these factors, and the impact of the Critical Care Information System were evaluated after eight months of operation. Results Positive influences on system adoption were associated with technical factors, including system ease of use, usefulness, and information relevancy; human factors, particularly user attitude; and organisational factors, namely clinical process-technology alignment and champions. Organisational factors such as planning, project management, training, technology support, turnover rate, clinical workload, and communication were barriers to system implementation and use. Recommendations to improve the current system problems were discussed. Most nursing staff positively perceived the system's reduction of documentation and data access time, giving them more time with patients. System acceptance varied among doctors. System use also had positive impacts on timesaving, data quality, and clinical workflow. Conclusions Critical Care Information Systems is crucial and has great potentials in enhancing and delivering critical care. However, the case study findings showed that the system faced complex challenges and was underutilised despite its potential. The role of socio-technical factors and their fit in realizing the potential of Critical Care Information Systems requires continuous, in-depth evaluation and stakeholder understanding and acknowledgement. The comprehensive and specific evaluation measures of the Human–Organisation–Technology Fit framework can flexibly evaluate Critical Care Information Systems.",7

Knowledge about users is used by publishing agencies and departments regulating TV content; on the basis of this information (age, gender) they are able to provide content that suits the interests of users. To this end, the creation of a highly precise image pattern recognition system is necessary, this may be one of the greatest challenges faced by computer technology in the last decades. These recognition systems must apply different pattern recognition techniques, in order to distinct gender and age in the images. In this work, we propose a multi-agent system that integrates different techniques for the acquisition, preprocessing and processing of images for the classification of age and gender. The system has been tested in an office building. Thanks to the use of a multi-agent system which allows to apply different workflows simultaneously, the performance of different methods could be compared (each flow with a different configuration). Experimental results have confirmed that a good preprocessing stage is necessary if we want the classification methods to perform well (Fisherfaces, Eigenfaces, Local Binary Patterns, Multilayer perceptron). The Fisherfaces method has proved to be more effective than MLP and the training time was shorter. In terms of the classification of age, Fisherfaces offers the best results in comparison to the rest of the system’s classifiers. The use of filters has allowed to reduce dimensionality, as a result the workload was reduced, a great advantage in a system that performs classification in real time.",

However, the target hardware platform for which we want to predict the performance is often different from the testbed on which the application performance measurements are done, and may not be unavailable for deployment for various practical reasons. This paper presents M3, a Measure-Measure-Model method, which uses a pipeline of three steps to address this problem. The methodology starts with measuring CPU service demands of the application on the testbed. Then, it builds clones that mimic the application code in terms of the type of operations, the number and size of network calls with external servers and API calls made at different layers of the technology stack. The clones are simple and easy to deploy, yet demonstrate the same speedup factor between the source and the target as the original application. The clones are then deployed on the testbed and on the target to estimate the application CPU service demand under light load generation. In the final step, this estimated CPU service demand is fed into specific performance modeling tools that are capable of predicting application performance on the target under arbitrary higher workload. Predictions made using this approach are validated against direct measurements made on five applications in Java and PHP, and on a number of combinations of testbed and target platforms (Intel and AMD servers) and the prediction error is always less than 20%.",

Of the various cognitive activities, a correct understanding of the situation, i.e. situation awareness (SA), is a crucial factor in improving performance and reducing error. However, existing system safety researches focus mainly on technical issues and often neglect SA. This study presents an innovative cognition-driven decision support system called the situation awareness support system (SASS) to manage abnormal situations in safety-critical environments in which the effect of situational complexity on human decision-makers is a concern. To achieve this objective, a situational network modeling process and a situation assessment model that exploits the specific capabilities of dynamic Bayesian networks and risk indicators are first proposed. The SASS is then developed and consists of four major elements: 1) a situation data collection component that provides the current state of the observable variables based on online conditions and monitoring systems, 2) a situation assessment component based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to model the hazardous situations in a situational network and a fuzzy risk estimation method to generate the assessment result, 3) a situation recovery component that provides a basis for decision-making to reduce the risk level of situations to an acceptable level, and 4) a human-computer interface. The SASS is partially evaluated by a sensitivity analysis, which is carried out to validate DBN-based situational networks, and SA measurements are suggested for a full evaluation of the proposed system. The performance of the SASS is demonstrated by a case taken from US Chemical Safety Board reports, and the results demonstrate that the SASS provides a useful graphical, mathematically consistent system for dealing with incomplete and uncertain information to help operators maintain the risk of dynamic situations at an acceptable level.",

In addition, the facility maintenance information needs to be constantly updated, which leads to an extra workload for staff using paper and two-dimensional drawings. To overcome these challenges, a system based on building information modeling (BIM) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) is developed for managing and maintaining facilities. The proposed system simultaneously connects the BIM model using industry foundation class (IFC) data structures, the facility maintenance database, and the RFID reader and shows the accessible data through the internet on a handheld screen. This approach provides a general framework for maintenance information management of building facilities. The framework invokes the proposed system to be for preventive maintenance and the reports based on it. The system is implemented in the case study of the building maintenance of a soccer stadium to validate the proposed system and demonstrate the system’s effectiveness for maintenance management. La détermination, le suivi, le contrôle et la gestion des installations et les problèmes connexes sont des tâches essentielles de la gestion des installations. De plus, l’information sur les besoins d’entretien des installations doit être constamment mise à jour, ce qui entraîne une charge de travail supplémentaire pour le personnel qui utilise du papier et des dessins bidimensionnels. Pour surmonter ces difficultés, un système basé sur la modélisation des données du bâtiment (MDB) et l’identification par radiofréquence (IRF) est développé pour gérer et entretenir les installations. Le système proposé relie simultanément le modèle MDB en utilisant les structures de données de « industry foundation classes », la base de données d’entretien des installations et le lecteur d’IRF, et montre les données accessibles par internet sur un écran portable. Cette approche fournit un cadre général pour la gestion de l’information sur l’entretien des bâtiments. Le cadre fait appel au système proposé pour l’entretien préventif et aux rapports qui en découlent.

We evaluated a dynamic allocation of monitoring tasks to human and automation by providing a monitoring request (MR) before a possible take-over request (TOR), with the aim to better prepare drivers to take over safely and efficiently. In a simulator-based study, an MR + TOR condition was compared with a TOR-only condition using a within-subject design with 41 participants. In the MR + TOR condition, an MR was triggered 12 s before a zebra crossing, and a TOR was provided 7 s after the MR onset if pedestrians crossing the road were detected. In the TOR-only condition, a TOR was provided 5 s before the vehicle would collide with a pedestrian if the participant did not intervene. Participants were instructed to perform a self-paced visual-motor non-driving task during automated driving. Eye tracking results showed that participants in the MR + TOR condition responded to the MR by looking at the driving environment. They also exhibited better take-over performance, with a shorter response time to the TOR and a longer minimum time to collision as compared to the TOR-only condition. Subjective evaluations also showed advantages of the MR: participants reported lower workload, higher acceptance, and higher trust in the MR + TOR condition as compared to the TOR-only condition. Participants’ reliance on automation was tested in a third drive (MR-only condition), where automation failed to provide a TOR after an MR. The MR-only condition resulted in later responses (and errors of omission) as compared to the MR + TOR condition. It is concluded that MRs have the potential to increase safety and acceptance of automated driving as compared to systems that provide only TORs. Drivers’ trust calibration and reliance on automation need further investigation.",

Mobile device adoption into practice is a recent trend that has increased dramatically and formal studies are needed to investigate consequent benefits and challenges. The objective of this study is to evaluate practitioner perceptions of improvements in productivity, provider-patient communications, care provision, technology usability and other outcomes following the adoption and use of a tablet computer connected to electronic health information resources. Methods A pilot program was initiated in June 2013 to evaluate the effect of mobile tablet computers at one health provider organization in the southeast United States. Providers were asked to volunteer for the evaluation and were each given a mobile tablet computer. A total of 42 inpatient and outpatient providers were interviewed in 2015 using a survey style questionnaire that utilized yes/no, Likert-style, and open ended questions. Each had previously used an electronic health record (EHR) system a minimum of one year outside of residency, and were regular users of personal mobile devices. Each used a mobile tablet computer in the context of their practice connected to the health system EHR. Results The survey results indicate that more than half of providers perceive the use of the tablet device as having a positive effect on patient communications, patient education, patient's perception of the provider, time spent interacting with patients, provider productivity, process of care, satisfaction with EHR when used together with the device, and care provision. Providers also reported feeling comfortable using the device (82.9%), would recommend the device to colleagues (69.2%), did not experience increased information security and privacy concerns (95%), and noted significant reductions in EHR login times (64.1%). Less than 25% of participants reported negative impacts on any of these areas as well as on time spent on order submission, note completion time, overall workload, patient satisfaction with care experience and patient outcomes. Gender, number of years in practice, practice type (general practitioner vs. specialist), and service type (inpatient/outpatient) were found to have a significant effect on perceptions of patient satisfaction, care process, and provider productivity. Conclusions Providers found positive gains from utilizing mobile devices in overall productivity, improved communications with their patients, the process of care, and technology efficiencies when used in combination with EHR and other health information resources. Demographic and health care work environment play a role in how mobile technologies are integrated into practice by providers.",

In this project, we assessed the feasibility of automatically detecting a patient's eligibility for a sample of breast cancer clinical trials by mapping coded clinical trial eligibility criteria to the corresponding clinical information automatically extracted from text in the EHR. Methods Three open breast cancer clinical trials were selected by oncologists. Their eligibility criteria were manually abstracted from trial descriptions using the OHDSI ATLAS web application. Patients enrolled or screened for these trials were selected as ‘positive’ or ‘possible’ cases. Other patients diagnosed with breast cancer were selected as ‘negative’ cases. A selection of the clinical data and all clinical notes of these 229 selected patients was extracted from the MUSC clinical data warehouse and stored in a database implementing the OMOP common data model. Eligibility criteria were extracted from clinical notes using either manually crafted pattern matching (regular expressions) or a new natural language processing (NLP) application. These extracted criteria were then compared with reference criteria from trial descriptions. This comparison was realized with three different versions of a new application: rule-based, cosine similarity-based, and machine learning-based. Results For eligibility criteria extraction from clinical notes, the machine learning-based NLP application allowed for the highest accuracy with a micro-averaged recall of 90.9% and precision of 89.7%. For trial eligibility determination, the highest accuracy was reached by the machine learning-based approach with a per-trial AUC between 75.5% and 89.8%. Conclusion NLP can be used to extract eligibility criteria from EHR clinical notes and automatically discover patients possibly eligible for a clinical trial with good accuracy, which could be leveraged to reduce the workload of humans screening patients for trials.",

This process is often performed using a paper-based mode, which intensifies workload and difficulty, wastes time, and is at risk of human errors. This study aims to design and evaluate a decision support system (DSS) to determine the triage level. Methods A combination of the Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR) and Fuzzy Logic Classifier (FLC) approaches were used to predict the triage level of patients according to the triage specialist’s opinions and Emergency Severity Index (ESI) guidelines. RBR was applied for modeling the first to fourth decision points of the ESI algorithm. The data relating to vital signs were used as input variables and modeled using fuzzy logic. Narrative knowledge was converted to If-Then rules using XML. The extracted rules were then used to create the rule-based engine and predict the triage levels. Results Fourteen RBR and 27 fuzzy rules were extracted and used in the rule-based engine. The performance of the system was evaluated using three methods with real triage data. The accuracy of the clinical decision support systems (CDSSs; in the test data) was 99.44%. The evaluation of the error rate revealed that, when using the traditional method, 13.4% of the patients were miss-triaged, which is statically significant. The completeness of the documentation also improved from 76.72% to 98.5%. Conclusions Designed system was effective in determining the triage level of patients and it proved helpful for nurses as they made decisions, generated nursing diagnoses based on triage guidelines. The hybrid approach can reduce triage misdiagnosis in a highly accurate manner and improve the triage outcomes.",

During the screening task, analysts manually assign a label to each citation, to designate whether a citation is eligible for inclusion in the review. Recently, several studies have explored the use of active learning in text classification to reduce the human workload involved in the screening task. However, existing approaches require a significant amount of manually labelled citations for the text classification to achieve a robust performance. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method that identifies relevant citations as early as possible in the screening process by exploiting the pairwise similarities between labelled and unlabelled citations to improve the classification performance without additional manual labelling effort. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that similar citations share the same label (e.g., if one citation should be included, then other similar citations should be included also). To calculate the similarity between labelled and unlabelled citations we investigate two different feature spaces, namely a bag-of-words and a spectral embedding based on the bag-of-words. The semi-supervised method propagates the classification codes of manually labelled citations to neighbouring unlabelled citations in the feature space. The automatically labelled citations are combined with the manually labelled citations to form an augmented training set. For evaluation purposes, we apply our method to reviews from clinical and public health. The results show that our semi-supervised method with label propagation achieves statistically significant improvements over two state-of-the-art active learning approaches across both clinical and public health reviews.",

Cloud computing provides a shared pool of resources in a distributed environment. It supports the features of utility-based computing. Efficient task provisioning on virtual machines is the major concern in an extensible cloud computing environment. The task provisioning minimizes the performance metrics total completion time (ms), average start time, average finish time, average execution time, scheduling time, and simulation time respectively. The scheduling is an important problem which becomes more complicated when various parameters consider. The key issue in virtual machine level scheduling is execution time overhead and scalability in a real-time scenario. Our objective is to make an optimal schedule of tasks on a virtual machine inside the datacenter using neural-bio inspired GA-ANN technique. This work presents a scheduler based on a genetic approach and an artificial neural network. The presented approach performs optimal scheduling of tasks on an appropriate virtual machine. The reliability of the system improves by reducing the number of tasks failed. The presented work uses a genetic algorithm to generated huge data sets and trains the neural model using the data set generated by using a genetic approach. The accuracy of the model is improved using back propagation with 98% accuracy. The set of experiments are performed using a scalable cloud computing environment. The presented bio-inspired technique is compared against nature-inspired, bio-inspired cost-aware BB–BC, GA-Cost, and GA-Exe based efficient task scheduling techniques. The results are obtained using real workload logs and synthetic data sets. Results indicate that the proposed GA-ANN bio-inspired predictive approach outperforms the considered nature-inspired scheduling approaches. The proposed algorithm is compared using various performance metrics total completion time, average start time, average finish time, and the fault rate, execution time, and scheduling time respectively. The proposed model reduces the fault rate by 82.63%, successfully completed tasks count improves by 26.81% and execution time improves by 10.66% and scheduling time improves by 69.94%. The scheduling time improves by 85.76% with an increasing number of iterations and constant numbers of tasks. Hence the presented GA-ANN scheduling technique outperformed the GA cost, GA EXE, and BB–BC COST scheduling approaches.",

This rapid growth is demanding the expansion of high-cost data infrastructures, which also underscores the industry’s need for cost-effective, high-performance distributed key-value stores. Designing key-value stores often involves a trade-off between performance and memory usage. For example, many previous studies focusing on minimizing the memory usage have developed on-disk indexing schemes, leading to lower performance. An alternative design based on in-memory indexing allows better performance, but at the expense of greater memory usage. This paper proposes a novel key-value store called PHash (Packed Hash) based on an advanced design of index and data structures that ensures both high performance and small memory usage. These advantages make the proposed scheme a better fit for processing demanding workloads in large-scale data-intensive applications. Compared to the best-performing competitor, FAWN-DS, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the memory consumption (bytes per key-value) by 83% and improves the GET throughput by up to 27.3% while the PUT throughput decreases by 12.6%. In particular, the GET performance of the proposed scheme reaches up to 99.4% of the optimal performance of the raw SSD (Solid State Drive).",

The workflow of these robotic services consists of data hungry, delay sensitive and compute intensive tasks. Generally, robots are not enriched in computational power and storage capabilities. It is thus beneficial to leverage the available Cloud resources to complement robots for executing robotic workflows. When multiple robots and Cloud instances work in a collaborative manner, optimal resource allocation for the tasks of a robotic workflow becomes a challenging problem. The diverse energy consumption rate of both robot and Cloud instances, and the cost of executing robotic workflow in such a distributed manner further intensify the resource allocation problem. Since the tasks are inter-dependent, inconvenience in data exchange between local robots and remote Cloud also degrade the service quality. Therefore, in this paper, we address simultaneous optimization of makespan, energy consumption and cost while allocating resources for the tasks of a robotic workflow. As a use case, we consider resource allocation for the robotic workflow of emergency management service in smart factory. We design an Edge Cloud based multi-robot system to overcome the limitations of remote Cloud based system in exchanging delay sensitive data. The resource allocation for robotic workflow is modelled as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem and it is solved through a multi-objective evolutionary approach, namely, NSGA-II algorithm. We have redesigned the NSGA-II algorithm by defining a new chromosome structure, pre-sorted initial population and mutation operator. It is further augmented by selecting the minimum distant solution from the non-dominated front to the origin while crossing over the chromosomes. The experimental results based on synthetic workload demonstrate that our augmented NSGA-II algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art works by at least 18% in optimizing makespan, energy and cost attributes on various scenarios.",

Here, we determined whether social choice–induced voluntary abstinence would prevent incubation of heroin craving. We also introduce a fully automatic social reward self-administration model that eliminates the intense workload and rat–human interaction of the original semiautomatic model. Methods In experiment 1, we trained male and female rats for social self-administration (6 days) and then for heroin self-administration (12 days). Next, we assessed relapse to heroin seeking after 1 and 15 abstinence days. Between tests, the rats underwent either forced or social choice–induced abstinence. In experiment 2, we developed a fully automatic social self-administration procedure by introducing a screen between the self-administration chamber and the social-peer chamber; the screen allows physical contact but prevents rats from crossing chambers. Next, we compared incubation of craving in rats with a history of standard (no-screen) or automatic (screen) social self-administration and social choice–induced abstinence. Results The time-dependent increase in heroin seeking after cessation of drug self-administration (incubation of craving) was lower after social choice–induced abstinence than after forced abstinence. There were no differences in social self-administration, social choice–induced abstinence, and incubation of craving in rats trained in the standard semiautomatic procedure versus the novel fully automatic procedure. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the protective effect of rewarding social interaction on heroin self-administration and incubation of heroin craving and introduces a fully automatic social self-administration and choice procedure to investigate the role of volitional social interaction in drug addiction and other psychiatric disorders.",11

However, Fog computing is still nascent and requires strong groundwork to adopt as practically feasible, cost-effective, efficient and easily deployable alternate to currently ubiquitous cloud. Fog computing promises to introduce cloud-like services on local network while reducing the cost. In this paper, we present a novel resource efficient framework for distributed video summarization over a multi-region fog computing paradigm. The nodes of the Fog network is based on resource constrained device Raspberry Pi. Surveillance videos are distributed on different nodes and a summary is generated over the Fog network, which is periodically pushed to the cloud to reduce bandwidth consumption. Different realistic workload in the form of a surveillance videos are used to evaluate the proposed system.

In the present driving simulator study, we investigated effects of time pressure on measures of eye movement, pupil diameter, cardiovascular and respiratory activity, driving performance, vehicle control, limb movement, head position, and self-reported state. Based on existing theories of human behavior under time pressure, we distinguished three categories of results: (1) driving speed, (2) physiological measures, and (3) driving strategies. Fifty-four participants drove a 6.9-km urban track with overtaking, car following, and intersection scenarios, first with no time pressure (NTP) and subsequently with time pressure (TP) induced by a time constraint and a virtual passenger urging to hurry up. The results showed that under TP in comparison to NTP, participants (1) drove significantly faster, an effect that was also reflected in auxiliary measures such as maximum brake position, throttle activity, and lane keeping precision, (2) exhibited increased physiological activity, such as increased heart rate, increased respiration rate, increased pupil diameter, and reduced blink rate, and (3) adopted scenario-specific strategies for effective task completion, such as driving to the left of the lane during car following, and early visual lookout when approaching intersections. The effects of TP relative to NTP were generally large and statistically significant. However, individual differences in absolute values were large. Hence, we recommend that real-time driver feedback technologies use relative instead of absolute criteria for assessing the driver’s state.",
