AB  - Many believe that immersive virtual reality (IVR) possesses transformative potential for a plethora of human activities that are mediated via technology, including education. In light of this, it is critically important to understand the determinants that influence learning in IVR environments and the interrelations among these determinants. For that matter, a model was developed that encapsulated ten potential factors influencing learning outcomes. Three hundred and thirty-four university students interacted with a purpose-built application that presented ancient Greek inventions through the use of head-mounted displays. Data analysis, adhering to a structural equation modeling approach, indicated that a multitude of factors exerted a positive influence on learning outcomes. These included the perceived quality of graphics, the perceived quality of feedback and content, and the perceived degree of interaction. Moreover, intrinsic motivation and the immersive experience that IVR provides also demonstrated a positive impact. Conversely, the perceived cognitive load and symptoms of simulator sickness manifested a negative impact. Interestingly, these factors did not appear to inhibit learners' motivation or their positive feelings. Age did not have any effect, while gender seemed to have an impact only on immersion. The implications of the results are also discussed.

AB  - An effective supply chain organization is fundamental for any manufacturing, distribution, retail or wholesale business. New technologies have made considerable improvements in the whole process of inventory management; Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the best options for the industry and their search for more intelligent and robust logistics solutions. Based on a real-world scenario, we approach the challenge of defining delivery routes within a city such that the time they require to be traveled is approximately the same. Moreover, while the routes must ensure that drivers’ workload is time balanced and contract regulations can be met, they also must correspond to a customers’ partition (sectorization) according to well-defined, non-overlapping delivery areas. We introduce an approach to solve the problem through the algorithm HSAC (Hierarchical Simulated Annealing Clustering). The proposed algorithm first applies a divisive approach to the data, using simulated annealing at each step to create time-balanced partitions, and then solves the TSP problem to create optimal routes within the defined groups. Based on real data concerning two Mexican cities, our experimental results show that HSAC can solve the sectorization problem efficiently.

AB  - Flight scenarios for assessment of airworthiness and evaluation of aircraft are imperative for the aircraft industry. A flight scenario developing method which takes both aircraft airworthiness and evaluation into consideration was proposed in this paper. Four aspects of techniques, including configuration of dynamical relations among flight environment, weather conditions and aircraft considerations, decomposition of flight crew tasks, mapping of workload functions and factors onto operational tasks, and specification of window events and data items, were provided and integrated based on methodological guide. The method adopted an automated planning and scheduling mechanism which facilitates recurrence of flight conditions and detection of working status of pilot, so that flight scenarios developed could be utilized in various flight tests for fulfillment of flight tasks, implementation of workload measurement, and establishment of minimum flight crew; hence ergonomic evaluation of pilot-aircraft interaction could be carried out which are useful for assessment of airworthiness, analysis of human factors, human-centered design of aircraft, virtual prototyping and engineering of aircraft.

AB  - Stereotypes are hugely influential in human-human interactions but have received little attention in human-computer interaction. The associations held for everyday technological devices and the ways these devices are stereotyped have the potential to influence interactions, and may be beneficial to designers in improving the congruency between a device and how it is used. This paper uses an online study (n ​= ​177) to explore how individuals utilise their smartphones, desktops, laptops and tablets, and understand the associations they attach to those devices. Results suggest that people do hold different associations for different devices, in particular that smartphones are seen to be efficient while desktops are seen to be work-related. Our results have implications in application areas such as design, and in particular suggest a need for future work that explores whether cognitive load can be reduced when the stereotypes of the device used is congruent with the task being performed.

AB  - Performance based evaluations are commonly completed as part of the human factors verification and validation of control rooms of new builds or substantial modernizations in Nuclear Power Plants. The validation of the Main Control Room system in the nuclear industry entails the assessment of specific performance components such as plant performance, situation awareness, workload, task performance, and anthropometric and physiological factors. This evaluation is expected to take place in realistic contexts, simulating the plant's operation and covering also abnormal and emergency operation situations. There is a vast set of measures to address these human performance components, and the relations among the different concepts and different measures are not clearly defined. The measures used to assess human performance can also vary significantly regarding the type of rater (self-rated, observer-rated, objective ratings), the type of scale (rating scales, correct/incorrect decisions, open answer, acceptability judgments), the moment of rating (online rating, end of scenario, scenario freezes), among others. In this paper we try to analyze these relationships between task performance, workload, and situation awareness. We explored the results of both self-rated, observer-rated, and objective measures. We explored the relations between and within measures, as well as the trends across the different assessments, affected by control room modifications. The results indicate a similar pattern in workload and situation awareness measures through evaluations; that the relations within self-rated measures appear to be clearer than between self-rated and observer-rated measures; and that there seems to be a trend for improved task performance results in the control room throughout the years.

AB  - Purpose
Maintenance workers often perform tasks with high levels of complexity. The association between maintenance task complexity and muscle fatigue needs further investigation. In this study, the effect of maintenance task complexity on muscle fatigue and perceived workload was evaluated.
Methods
Fifteen male participants performed two maintenance tasks with two levels of complexity: repairing a gearbox of piston pump (complex task) and repairing a faulty pump housing (simple task). The electromyographic (EMG) activity data from six muscle sites of the neck and the dominant side of the shoulder and arm were recorded. Muscle fatigue was assessed using normalized root-mean-square (RMS) of EMG data and the slopes of median frequency (MF) and mean power frequency (MPF). The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was utilized as a secondary subjective measure for perceived workload.
Findings
Compared to the simple task, performance of the complex task was associated with significantly higher values of RMS EMG (29.92% in average) for all sampled muscles. The slopes of MF and MPF for the flexor carpi radialis muscle during the complex task were significantly lower than that of the simple task. Also, TLX scores for the complex task were significantly higher than those for the simple task.
Conclusions
Findings of this study indicate that, within the sampled muscles, the complexity of the maintenance task could cause more muscle fatigue, especially for the forearm muscle. The results of the TLX scores suggest that task complexity could contribute to a significant increase in mental, physical, and temporal demands, effort, and frustration.
Relevance to industry
The findings of this study could be utilized to improve the designs of industrial maintenance tasks with respect to human ability and performance.

AB  - How rigidly does innate architecture constrain function of developing cortex? What is the contribution of early experience? We review insights into these questions from visual cortex function in people born blind. In blindness, occipital cortices are active during auditory and tactile tasks. What ‘cross-modal’ plasticity tells us about cortical flexibility is debated. On the one hand, visual networks of blind people respond to higher cognitive information, such as sentence grammar, suggesting drastic repurposing. On the other, in line with ‘metamodal’ accounts, sighted and blind populations show shared domain preferences in ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC), suggesting visual areas switch input modality but perform the same or similar perceptual functions (e.g., face recognition) in blindness. Here we bring these disparate literatures together, reviewing and synthesizing evidence that speaks to whether visual cortices have similar or different functions in blind and sighted people. Together, the evidence suggests that in blindness, visual cortices are incorporated into higher-cognitive (e.g., fronto-parietal) networks, which are a major source long-range input to the visual system. We propose the connectivity-constrained experience-dependent account. Functional development is constrained by innate anatomical connectivity, experience and behavioral needs. Infant cortex is pluripotent, the same anatomical constraints develop into different functional outcomes.

AB  - Advancements in portable neuroimaging technologies open up new opportunities to gain insight into the neural dynamics and cognitive processes underlying day-to-day behaviors. In this study, we evaluated the relevance of a headphone- mounted electroencephalogram (EEG) system for monitoring mental workload. The participants (N = 12) were instructed to pay attention to auditory alarms presented sporadically while performing the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) whose difficulty was staged across three conditions to manipulate mental workload. The P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP) elicited by the presentation of auditory alarms were used as probes of attentional resources available. The amplitude and latency of P300 ERPs were compared across experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that the P300 ERP component can be captured using a headphone-mounted EEG system. Moreover, neural responses to alarm could be used to classify mental workload with high accuracy (over 80%) at a single-trial level. Our analyses indicated that the signal-to-noise ratio acquired by the sponge-based sensors remained stable throughout the recordings. These results highlight the potential of portable neuroimaging technology for the development of neuroassistive applications while underscoring the current limitations and challenges associated with the integration of EEG sensors in everyday-life wearable technologies. Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of research exploring the feasibility and validity of wearable neuroimaging technologies for the study of human cognition and behavior in real-world settings.

AB  - A finite capacity planning heuristic is developed for semiconductor manufacturing with high- mix low-volume production, complex processes, variable cycle times and reentrant flows characteristics. The proposed algorithm projects production lots trajectories (start and end dates) for the remaining process steps, estimates the expected load for all machines and balances the workload against bottleneck tools capacities. It takes into account lots’ priorities, cycle time variability and equipment saturation. This algorithm helps plant management to define feasible target production plans. It is programmed in java, and tested on real data instances from STMicroelectronics Crolles300 production plant which allowed its assessment on the effectiveness and efficiency. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed heuristic outperforms current practices for capacity planning and opens new perspectives for the production line management.

After showing the limitations of an initial model, in particular to support relevant decisions, the min–max fairness workload balancing problem is motivated and positioned in the literature. The Iterated Min–Max (IMM) procedure is then presented, with its properties, and illustrated. The IMM consists in solving a succession of linear programs using information from dual variables obtained at each iteration. Computational results on industrial instances show the relevance of the approach when compared to the initial model. The current use of the IMM procedure in an industrial tool is discussed.

AB  - Wearable sensors are currently being used to manage fatigue in professional athletics, transportation and mining industries. In manufacturing, physical fatigue is a challenging ergonomic/safety “issue” since it lowers productivity and increases the incidence of accidents. Therefore, physical fatigue must be managed. There are two main goals for this study. First, we examine the use of wearable sensors to detect physical fatigue occurrence in simulated manufacturing tasks. The second goal is to estimate the physical fatigue level over time. In order to achieve these goals, sensory data were recorded for eight healthy participants. Penalized logistic and multiple linear regression models were used for physical fatigue detection and level estimation, respectively. Important features from the five sensors locations were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), a popular variable selection methodology. The results show that the LASSO model performed well for both physical fatigue detection and modeling. The modeling approach is not participant and/or workload regime specific and thus can be adopted for other applications.

AB  - Wearable devices are increasingly used for assessing physiological data. Industry 4.0 aims to achieve the real-time assessment of the workers’ condition to adapt processes including the current mental workload. Mental workload can be assessed via physiological data. This paper researches the potential of wearable devices for mental workload assessment by utilizing heart rate and motion data collected with a smartwatch. A laboratory study was conducted with four levels of mental workload, ranging from none to high and during sitting and stepping activities. When sitting, a difference in the heart rate and motion data from the smartwatch was only found between no mental workload and any mental workload task. For the stepping condition, differences were found for the movement data. Based on these results, wearable devices could be useful in the future for detecting whether a mental demanding task is currently performed during low levels of physical activity.

To build the model, a driving scenario was first identified based on the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) driving route. The driving model was created using IMPRINT, a discrete event simulation tool that characterizes four classes of human resources that may contribute to driver workload: visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor (VACP). For this initial model we tested limited number and type of distractions. The initial use of a sample of driver aids and their importance to mitigating driver distractions has also been included.
Relevance to Industry
This study investigated the use of a driver workload simulation model to provide commercial vehicle interface designers a tool to investigate the impact of the multiple activities an operator performs while driving. A simulation model can predict the changes in driver workload due to multiple secondary tasks performed in varying driving conditions.

AB  - Mental workload is a multidimensional construct that involves the characteristics of the task, individual factors, and the environment where the task is performed. Responses to tasks that are perceived as mentally demanding can exacerbate ergonomics risk factors affecting employee behavior and attitude, leading to risky actions such as awkward body postures, and consequently increasing physiological susceptibility to work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The present study looked to establish if the perception of mental workload can be affected by psychosocial work factors that generate changes in the environment in which humans must perform the tasks. The study also looked to determine if changes in perceived mental workload generated changes in the body postures undertaken to perform an activity to lay the foundation for future exploration into the influence of perceived mental workload over physical demands. The results of this study indicate, that an increase in the perception of mental workload is associated with worse body postures. This study is novel and contributes to overcoming an important shortcoming in the field of mental workload by considering the influence of psychosocial factors, keeping the physical load constant, on the perception of mental workload and its influence on body postures. This interaction between perceived mental workload and its effects on physical risk should be considered in occupational settings since often, employees are exposed to concurrent physical and mental demands that increase the likelihood of developing WMSDs.

AB  - Machine learning and learning analytics are powerful tools that not only support researchers in the detailed measurement and enhancement of learning processes in various learning environments, but also enable the aggregation and synthesis of evidence regarding effective educational practices. This paper describes the development and application of machine learning algorithms aimed at semi-automatic selection of abstracts for a meta-analysis on the effects of simulation-based learning in higher education. The goal was to reduce the workload while also maintaining the transparency and objectivity of the selection process. The algorithms were trained, validated, and tested on a set of 3187 studies on simulation-based learning found in medical and educational databases collected before April 2018. Subsequently, they were utilized to classify abstracts for a follow-up meta-analysis consisting of 2373 studies (published between 2018 and 2020). The aim of training the algorithms was to predict studies’ abstract eligibility based on words and combinations of words used in these abstracts. The application of the algorithms reduced the number of studies that had to be manually screened from 2373 to 711. A total of 458 studies from automatically selected abstracts were included in the full-text screening, indicating the high precision of the algorithms (also compared to the performance of human raters). We conclude that machine learning algorithms can be trained and used to classify abstracts for their eligibility, significantly reducing the workload for the researchers without diminishing objectivity and quality when updating systematic literature reviews with or without a meta-analysis.

AB  - Thanks to rapid technological developments in robotics, various automation technologies are being applied in warehouses today. Order picking, as a key process in warehouse operations, has drawn attention in academia and practice for decades. In addition to many studies dedicated to manual and fully automated order picking, efforts have also been made to study semi-automated warehouses in which humans and robots collaborate. However, these studies mostly focused on system efficiency and ignored ergonomic aspects. Order picking was confirmed as a labor-intensive process in an environment in which workers are at a high risk of developing health problems. Therefore, this study addresses the investigation of physical human working conditions in both manual and robot-assisted order picking systems via real-life laboratory experiments and simulation modeling. We used a motion capture system to assess human working postures when working with and without robot assistance. In addition, we estimated the daily workload by applying the energy expenditure concept. Using simulation experiments, we were able to extend the results to various practical scenarios with different design variables, for example warehouse layouts, order sizes, and human-robot team configuration. Our preliminary results reveal that human-robot collaboration can reduce human workload. Posture evaluation also shows a slight improvement.

AB  - In this study, we present a new mathematical model of a multi-objective dynamic cellular manufacturing system (MDCMS) that considers human factors. Human factors are incorporated into the proposed model in terms of human reliability and decision-making processes. Three objective functions are considered simultaneously. The first objective minimizes the total cost of the MDCMS. The second objective function minimizes inconsistency in the decision-making style of operators in the common manufacturing cells. The third objective function balances the workload of cells with respect to the efficiency of operators, which is calculated based on human reliability analysis. Various studies have been conducted in the field of MDCMS, but human factors have not received sufficient attention as important elements. Due to the NP-hardness of the MDCMS problem, two innovative meta-heuristic algorithms are developed, i.e., a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method. The results obtained by the algorithms were compared and analyzed using different criteria. Several test problems were considered to verify and validate the proposed model and solution methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider human reliability and decision-making styles in a large MDCMS in an actual production setting.

AB  - In human-robot collaborative (HRC) manufacturing systems, how the collaborative robots engage in the collaborative tasks and complete the corresponding work in a timely manner according to the actual state has been a critical factor that hinders the efficiency of HRC. Inappropriate collaborative behaviors will result in a poor perceptual experience for human operators (e.g., robots starting action too early or too late). To address this issue, a fusion-based spiking neural networks (FSNNs) approach for collaboration request prediction is proposed, aiming to find the right collaboration timing for robots in HRC assembly system and to minimize human aversion without affecting human operation behaviors. By encoding human behavior, product state and robot pose into spiking signals that can be processed by FSNNs, the spatio-temporal coupling relationship between those three aspects can be comprehensively analyzed, and to solve the appropriate timing of robot participation in collaboration. Finally, demonstrative experiments are carried out on the HRC assembly of generator end caps in the lab environment. Compared with the baseline methods, the decision accuracy of the proposed one is improved by nearly 30%, which further proves its effectiveness.

AB  - The default-mode network (DMN) is a distributed functional brain system integral for social and higher-order cognition in humans with implications in a myriad of neuropsychological disorders. In this study, we compared the functional architecture of the DMN between humans and marmosets to assess their similarities and differences using joint gradients. This approach permits simultaneous large-scale mapping of functional systems across the cortex of humans and marmosets, revealing evidence of putative homologies between them. In doing so, we find that the DMN architecture of the marmoset exhibits differences along its anterolateral-posterior axis. Specifically, the anterolateral node of the DMN (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) displayed weak connections and inconsistent connection topographies as compared to its posterior DMN-nodes (posterior cingulate and posterior parietal cortices). We also present evidence that the marmoset medial prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe areas correspond to other macroscopical distributed functional systems that are not part of the DMN. Given the importance of the marmoset as a pre-clinical primate model for higher-order cognitive functioning and the DMN's relevance to cognition, our results suggest that the marmoset may lack the capacity to integrate neural information to subserve cortical dynamics that are necessary for supporting diverse cognitive demands.

AB  - Particular design features intended to improve usability – including graphically displayed observations and integrated colour-based scoring-systems – have been shown to increase the speed and accuracy with which users of hospital observation charts detect abnormal patient observations. We used eye-tracking to evaluate two potential cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects. Novice chart-users completed a series of experimental trials in which they viewed patient data presented on one of three observation chart designs (varied within-subjects), and indicated which observation was abnormal (or that none were). A chart that incorporated both graphically displayed observations and an integrated colour-based scoring-system yielded faster, more accurate responses and fewer, shorter fixations than a graphical chart without a colour-based scoring-system. The latter, in turn, yielded the same advantages over a tabular chart (which incorporated neither design feature). These results suggest that both colour-based scoring-systems and graphically displayed observations improve search efficiency and reduce the cognitive resources required to process vital sign data.

AB  - The involvement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in working memory is controversially discussed. Recent findings suggest that persistent neural firing in the hippocampus during maintenance in verbal working memory is associated with workload. Here, we recorded single neuron firing in 13 epilepsy patients (7 male) while they performed a visual working memory task. The number of colored squares in the stimulus set determined the workload of the trial. Performance was almost perfect for low workload (1 and 2 squares) and dropped at high workload (4 and 6 squares), suggesting that high workload exceeded working memory capacity. We identified maintenance neurons in MTL neurons that showed persistent firing during the maintenance period. More maintenance neurons were found in the hippocampus for trials with correct compared to incorrect performance. Maintenance neurons increased and decreased firing in the hippocampus and increased firing in the entorhinal cortex for high compared to low workload. Population firing predicted workload particularly during the maintenance period. Prediction accuracy of workload based on single-trial activity during maintenance was strongest for neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The data suggest that persistent neural firing in the MTL reflects a domain-general process of maintenance supporting performance and workload of multiple items in working memory below and beyond working memory capacity. Persistent neural firing during maintenance in the entorhinal cortex may be associated with its preference to process visual-spatial arrays.

AB  - The predominant approach on machining is to manufacture a workpiece on a complex done-in-one machine tool. In contrast, the Cellular Manufacturing concept splits up the machining steps and distributes them sequentially to several simpler and cost-efficient machine tools with a higher manual workload. Both concepts are technically feasible, but the question which approach is favorable from an economic perspective is still open. This article first identifies relevant input factors like machining tasks, operator work content, labor and capital costs, etc. Available machine tools are grouped by a k-means cluster analysis, human tasks of operation are identified by an MTM-UAS analysis. Together with key performance indicators like ‘cell balancing efficiency’, all data are transferred into monetary values and combined to a static total cost comparison model. The paper closes with a validation on industrial parts and a sensitivity analysis of the results achieved.

AB  - Ergonomics continues to be relevant in work-places in which a significant amount of manual labor exists, such as in some of the Cellular manufacturing Systems (CMS). In order to distribute the workload evenly over all the workers in the line, some of the industries resorted to the practice of rotating all the workers through all workstations in the cell (Nagare cell) that prevents monotony and boredom. The presence of automated equipment in the cell will hamper this strategy for job rotation. This study aims to demonstrate the application of ergonomically designed looping layout in the assembly cell in the labor demanded lean manufacturing environment. The study was conducted in a process line in an automobile ancillary unit. The current process line which was conventional U-shaped line was simulated and the productivity has been verified and validated with the real life environment. Process map showed that the operators walked long distances, felt stress in certain workstations and that inventory piled up at the bottleneck workstation. We identify sub-cells within the cell. With the same manpower, we develop a new layout (Suzhal) and make workers rotate within each sub-cell. The proposed layout was simulated and results have been compared with the current layout. The analysis shows a reduction in the total operating cycle time, higher alertness among operators, better distribution of workloads in the group and hence higher productivity.

AB  - Workload control (WLC) is a methodology that aims to regulate the total workload in the production system by controlling the input and output of orders. It leads to more predictable throughput times and more accurate delivery date promising. In this paper, we propose a representation of the workload control principles by means of a dynamic model based on bond graphs, and present the modeling of this system. According to the bond graph methodology, the manufacturing entities can be associated to constitutive equations, which can be combined to generate a state model. The presented state model provides informations about instantaneous levels of work in process of the system, and can show the effect of release policies (input control) and capacity adjustments (output control) into these levels of work in process. Exploratory simulations were carried out in Simulink. The existing simulation of WLC systems usually employs open-loop descriptive models based on discrete events simulation, and the parameters of input and output control are empirically/experimentally defined. A gap was identified in the literature, specially concerning the parameter setting for output control. In the proposed model, input and output control are performed automatically, by the controllers implemented to the dynamic model (closed-loop system). Therefore, the proposed approach can bring prescriptive directions to the parameter setting of WLC, and we believe it can also bring future comparative insights to the existing simulations of this methodology.

AB  - A mixed-methods approach was used to assess the fidelity of virtual environments as ergonomic assessment tools for human-robot interaction. Participants performed a visual search task in the physical environment while a nearby collaborative robot repeatedly extended its arm toward them. This scenario was reconstructed in two virtual environments with different levels of graphical detail. Measures of presence, task performance, workload, and anxiety were taken to determine the effect of robot motion in all three environments. Task performance decreased in response to robot motion in the physical environment, while workload and anxiety increased. This simple effect of motion was consistent across environments for measures of task performance and anxiety. However, people performed faster overall in virtual reality, and the effect of motion on workload was greatly reduced in virtual reality. Results in the virtual environments suggest that people were distracted by the sound of the robot, and that presence was affected by manipulations of immersion and coherence.

AB  - In the United States, school mathematics generally fails to help students see themselves as capable of impacting their world – a perspective Freire argues defines human agency. This analysis draws from a five-week Algebra intervention for middle school students (n=46) designed to promote agency through collaborative mathematical activity. Typically, students identified as underperforming (as most in this intervention were), teachers revert to procedural, low-level instruction. In contrast, this intervention was designed around tasks of high cognitive demand that required visual or symbolic representation of algebraic concepts. Qualitative coding of student interviews (n=46) confirm the design principles of authority, agency and collaboration were positively impactful for students. In particular, interviews evidence a changing perspective from math as boring to the possibility of math as comingling intellectual challenge and personal enjoyment. These results are traced to the design principles and in particular, the focus on organizing for agency.

AB  - Construction projects often see owners who exert their dominance by modifying the standard contracts without contractors’ prior consent. This can lead to undesirable outcomes for contractors, thus referred to as unilateral contractual change risk (UCCR) in this study. As such, identifying UCCR proactively becomes essential for contractors, particularly in engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) projects where the claim scope is limited. Although natural language processing (NLP) has shown promise in the identification of UCCR, it faces difficulties due to the high cognitive demands required. To fill the gap, we propose a rational-augmented NLP framework that emulates human reasoning to identify UCCR in EPC contracts in an explainable and effective manner. The framework (1) leverages NLP techniques to disassemble contract text into features that draw the attention of human readers for obligation-related comprehension, and (2) generates a coherent sequence of intermediate reasoning steps using a customized Microsoft Excel and-in interface to identify predetermined categories of UCCR. Our framework, which achieves an outstanding F1 score of 0.87, is trained on a widely used standard form of EPC contract. It also presents a user-friendly interface for contractors to discern any intentional or malicious acts committed by the owner during the contract stage. Furthermore, our methodology can be adapted to enhance risk management in other sectors.

AB  - Human brains rely on oscillatory coupling mechanisms for regulating access to prefrontal cognitive resources, dynamically communicating between the frontal and remote cortex. We worry that communications across cortical regions will be impeded when humans in extreme space environments travel with mental load work, affecting the successful completion of missions. Here, we monitored crews of workers performing a Go/Nogo task in space travel, accompanied by acquisitions of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. These data demonstrated that when the target stimulus suddenly changed to the non-target stimulus, an instantaneous communication mechanism between the frontal and occipital cortex was established by theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). However, this frontal-occipital communication was impeded because of the mental workload of space travel. 86 healthy volunteers who participated in the ground imitation further indicated that mental workload caused decoupled theta-gamma PAC during the Go/Nogo task, impeding frontal-occipital communications and behavioral performance. We also found that the degree of theta-gamma PAC coupling in space was significantly lower than on the ground, indicating that mental workload and other hazards worsen the impeded frontal-occipital communications of humans. These results could guide countermeasures for the inadaptability of humans working in spaceflight.

AB  - As powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) becomes a more mature field, system configurations are gradually moving away from the classic single heat source, layer-by-layer system configurations towards unconventional system configurations that offer higher throughput. Higher throughput systems allow PBF systems to be considered for a larger variety of industrial applications. However, the inclusion of multiple heat sources, or beams, also increases the complexity of the control schemes needed. For multi-beam systems with overlapping fields of view, the distribution of workload, or load balancing, across these beams directly affects the total print time for a build. Additionally, the probability of any beam failing in a multi-beam system increases with the number of beams. While manual methods of load balancing and dealing with beam failures are reasonable for current generation multi-beam systems, as system configurations become more complex, manual methods will become prohibitively inefficient. This paper introduces two different ways to load balance multi-beam systems of various configuration types, regardless of their complexity, which are highly performant. A consequence of this performance is the enablement of on-the-fly load balancing in the event a beam fails, thus improving system robustness.

AB  - A growing body of literature suggests that adding game elements to learning tasks indirectly influences the learning process by increasing engagement with the tasks. The present study aims to advance learning engagement research by examining an often neglected subcomponent of behavioral engagement, attrition. Implementing two equivalent versions of a learning task, differing solely in the presence of game elements, allowed unequivocal attribution of any effect on the presence of game elements. Conducting the study in an online learning environment allowed further a highly unconstrained examination of the effects of game elements on attrition. We found that game elements affected both participant attrition and engagement of participants who completed the learning task. Participants with low self-efficacy were particularly prone to drop out in the non-game condition. Game elements also affected both learning efficacy and efficiency. We further found task attractivity to partially mediate the effect of game elements on learning outcomes. The results suggest that by facilitating engagement via task attractivity game elements can compensate to some extent for the increased cognitive demand that the game elements induce. We finally discuss the importance of considering the interrelations between learner characteristics, game elements, and engagement for interpreting results on learning performance measures.

AB  - Systematic process planning is a key enabler for robust product realization from design through manufacturing. Every process and operation must be designed in the best possible way to ensure that the overall process chain leads to the right product quality. During the last two decades a shift from inspection of manufactured products to a more holistic approach with quality assurance as an integrated activity throughout the product realization process has emerged in manufacturing industry. The importance of the principles addressed in the methods and tools used in automotive industry for quality management is indisputable. However, the tasks of creating and managing documents for Process Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (PFMEA), Control plans, Initial process studies and Measurement System Analysis (MSA) results in high workload. Also, lack of interoperability between different computer applications used in process planning and quality assurance results in information fragmentation, data duplication and potential data inconsistency. This paper proposes a novel, model driven approach for process planning integrating quality assurance which emphasizes the application of digital models to create, represent and use information of products, processes and resources. By reducing the amount of data and document duplication, the presented model driven approach has potential to radically increase the direct value adding part of manufacturing engineer's daily work also contributing to achieve a more holistic view in interdisciplinary work between different experts in product realization.

AB  - Labour is the single largest cost contributor and main limiting factor to development of the agricultural industry. Manual labour remains a major, essential factor for greenhouse-grown specialty crops. Furthermore, musculoskeletal injuries are prevalent during manual work processes performed in agricultural environments. This study aims to improve work efficiency and productivity and to identify tasks that can cause musculoskeletal injury. Working procedures were characterised using a work-study method, environmental conditions were recorded and a biomechanical analysis of the inspected task was conducted. An innovative measuring system was developed that enables synchronisation and analysis of the manufacturing, biomechanics, workload and environmental data. The study focused on the trellising and harvesting stages of pepper and tomato in greenhouses on two farms located in southwest Israel. We further conducted several experiments in which we changed the working method and assessed the effect on productivity. Another experiment was conducted to test the effect of three different trellising angles (30°, 60°, 90°) on labour and yield in tomato. The results revealed that in tomato, in comparison to current methods, picking 4 fruit per cycle will increase production rate by 17%, leaf removal from the fruit area will increase production rate by 14.4%—up to 40.2%—and the best trellising angle with respect to yield and labour will be 30°. Analysis of biomechanical risk showed that the maximum weight of lifted boxes should not exceed 12 kg, and when picking fruit growing low to the ground, the workers are exposed to medium to high risk of injury.

AB  - Construction is one of the most hazardous industries, in part because it involves dynamic and cognitively demanding tasks that tax workers' mental resources. Though some previous studies showed increases in workers' mental load can adversely affect the safety-critical function of workers' situational awareness, limited previous work has utilized machine learning (ML) techniques for mental load classification models with Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals to passively identify at-risk workers suffering excessive mental loads. Within an immersive mixed-reality environment simulating an electrical construction task, this study employed ensemble modeling to classify workers' mental load via their fNIRS-captured brain activation. Beyond identifying the prefrontal and motor cortices as the most important brain areas contributing to ML-driven mental load classifications when using fNIRS, this paper also proposes a mental load classification methodology that synthesizes neuroimaging data with individuals' risk-propensity scores to address the limitations of existing personalized and generalized ML models. The results reveal better performance for fNIRS-based mental load classifications given participants' personal risk propensity (risk-seeker and risk-averse). This research, therefore, (1) offers valuable insights into the importance of identifying at-risk workers who are more likely to experience impaired cognitive processing and situational awareness due to increased mental load, and (2) sheds light on reliable pipelines for developing fNIRS-based mental load classification.

AB  - In make-to-order (MTO) manufacturing enterprises, when the workload of the manufacturing system is heavy, it may lead to the delay of orders. In order to reduce the delay and the resulting negative impact, the appropriate and reasonable overtime work is an effective and commonly used approach. However, if the overtime work is used unreasonably, not only cannot it increase the production speed but also may lead to higher manufacturing costs. In order to use overtime work optimally, a multi-objective job shop scheduling problem with overtime work consideration (MOJSSP/O) is proposed to minimize total tardiness and overtime costs. An enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ENSGA-Ⅱ) is developed to address the problem. To accelerate the convergence, a problem-specific two-stage decoding scheme is designed. An adaptive mechanism is applied to keep the stability of global convergence and a local search procedure is adopted to enhance the exploitation ability. Experiments on 38 modified JSSP benchmarks are provided to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Computational results validate the effectiveness of the presented improvements, and show that the proposed ENSGA-Ⅱ outperforms the other well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on all test instances.

AB  - This study evaluated newly proposed Human–Machine Interface (HMI) design concepts for improving the ergonomics of hydraulic excavators. The design concepts were based on an augmented interaction technique which involved the use of heads-up display (HUD) and coordinated control as HMI elements. Two alternative HMI designs were elaborated in order to separately evaluate the ergonomic impacts of the head-up display and the coordinated control by comparing them to the standard HMI design. The effectiveness of these three HMI designs in terms of the reduction of the operators' mental and physical workload were assessed by conducting experiments utilizing human subjects, ages 23–35 years. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Task Load Index (NASA TLX) method was used for collecting subjective workload scores based on a weighted average of ratings of six factors: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Own Performance, Effort, and Frustration Level. The results showed that the type of HMI design affects different aspects of the operator's workload. Indeed, it showed how the proposed augmented interaction is an effective solution for reducing the ergonomic gaps in terms of mental workload, and to a lesser extent the physical workload, subjected by the standard HMI design.
Relevance to industry
This study proposes innovative HMI solutions featuring heads-up display and coordinated control to improve the ergonomics of the hydraulic excavator HMI, particularly in reducing the operators' mental and physical workload. The results of this study promises to be an innovative approach for developing new HMI designs by hydraulic excavator manufacturers.

AB  - A systematic review of studies providing evidence of the linkage between human factors (HF) in the design and management of operations to production quality performance was conducted. 71 peer reviewed research papers were found to provide evidence of the HF-Quality relationship. These studies identified 178 design factors relating to quality. These included 1) Product Design (54), 2) Production Process Design (75), and 3) Workstation Design aspects (49). In addition 26 Individual quality risk factors were identified. Of the studies identified, about half studied the effects on the human finding associations with the operator workload and fatigue indicators and quality performance. These intermediary variables may provide insight into the mechanism by which HF flaws in the design of production lead to quality deficits in running manufacturing. These results provide useful information for operations managers and production system design teams to secure higher quality performance in their systems by applying human factors.

AB  - Artificial lighting, which profits from the non-visual effects of light, is a potentially promising solution to support residents’ psychophysiological health and performance at specific times of the day in enclosed environments. However, few studies have investigated the non-visual effects of daytime correlated colour temperature (CCT) and its exposure timing on human alertness, cognition, and mood. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are largely unknown. The current study evaluated the effects of daytime CCT and its exposure timing on markers of subjective experience, cognitive performance, and cerebral activity in a simulated enclosed environment. Forty-two participants participated a single-blind laboratory study with a 4 within (CCT: 4000 K vs. 6500 K vs. 8500 K vs. 12,000 K) × 2 between (exposure timing: morning vs. afternoon) mixed design. The results showed time of the day dependent benefits of the daytime CCT on subjective experience, vigilant attention, response inhibition, working memory, emotional perception, and risk decisions. The results of the electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed that lower-frequency EEG bands, including theta, alpha, and alpha-theta, were quite sensitive to daytime CCT intervention, which provides a valuable reference for trying to establish the underlying mechanisms that support the performance-enhancement effects of exposure to CCT in the daytime. However, the results revealed no consistent intervention pattern across these measurements. Therefore, future studies should consider personalised optimisation of daytime CCT for different cognitive demands.

AB  - Cognitive control, with a limited capacity, is a core process in human cognition for the coordination of thoughts and actions. Although the regions involved in cognitive control have been identified as the cognitive control network (CCN), it is still unclear whether a specific region of the CCN serves as a bottleneck limiting the capacity of cognitive control (CCC). Here, we used a perceptual decision-making task with conditions of high cognitive load to challenge the CCN and to assess the CCC in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. We found that the activation of the right anterior insular cortex (AIC) of the CCN increased monotonically as a function of cognitive load, reached its plateau early, and showed a significant correlation to the CCC. In a subsequent study of patients with unilateral lesions of the AIC, we found that lesions of the AIC were associated with a significant impairment of the CCC. Simulated lesions of the AIC resulted in a reduction of the global efficiency of the CCN in a network analysis. These findings suggest that the AIC, as a critical hub in the CCN, is a bottleneck of cognitive control.

AB  - This study uses Digital Human Modelling (DHM) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to examine how caring for COVID-19-positive (C+) patients affects nurses' workload and care-quality. DHM inputs include: nurse anthropometrics, task postures, and hand forces. DES inputs include: unit-layout, patient care data, COVID-19 status & impact on tasks, and task execution-logic. The study shows that reducing nurses' biomechanical workload increases mental workload and decreases direct patient care, potentially leading to stress, burnout, and errors. Compared to pre-pandemic conditions, when nurses were assigned five C+ patients, cumulative bilateral shoulder moments and lumbar load decreased by 38%, 36%, and 46%, respectively. However, this was accompanied by increases in mental workload (242%), task waiting-time (70%), and missed-care (353%). These effects were driven by the large increase in required infection control routines. Combining DHM and DES can help evaluate workplace/task designs and provide valuable insights for healthcare system design-policy setting and operational management decision-making.

AB  - When discussing dependability of mechanized, discrete item production, the focus tends to be on maintenance. By studying experiences and breakdown data from eight automotive manufacturing sites in Sweden, a new view on the problem arises. It seems that on average, 40% of the breakdowns are related to poor maintenance practices. This indicates that maintenance management is not the dominant cause of breakdowns. Rather, companies should focus on human factors, e.g. skills, routines, and workload, among operators, as well as maintenance staff. Also, the Early Equipment Management process requires more attention in order to increase the dependability in the production system.

AB  - Autonomous unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are being utilized at an increasing rate for a number of military applications. The role of a human operator differs from that of a pilot in a manned aircraft, and this new role creates a need for a shift in interface and task design in order to take advantage of the full potential of these systems. This study examined the effects of time pressure and target uncertainty on autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle operator task performance and workload. A 2 × 2 within subjects experiment design was conducted using Multi-Modal Immersive Intelligent Interface for Remote Operation (MIIIRO) software. The primary task was image identification, and secondary tasks consisted of responding to events encountered in typical UAS operations. Time pressure was found to produce a significant difference in subjective workload ratings as well as secondary task performance scores, while target uncertainty was found to produce a significant difference in the primary task performance scores. Interaction effects were also found for primary tasks and two of the secondary tasks. This study has contributed to the knowledge of UAS operation, and the factors which may influence performance and workload within the UAS operator. Performance and workload effects were shown to be elicited by time pressure. Relevance to industry: The research findings from this study will help the UAS community in designing human computer interface and enable appropriate business decisions for staffing and training, to improve system performance and reduce the workload.

AB  - Most research on production planning and control (PPC) focuses on control structures, mathematical models, and algorithms, without explicitly considering human behavior. To consider a behavioral perspective of the PPC concept of workload control (WLC), we conduct a laboratory experiment. The study’s aim is to investigate the effects of changing workload norms, the influence of feedback information, and coworker queue length information on operators’ reaction behavior. To do so, we perform an assessment across two dimensions: operators’ (i) performance and (ii) arousal level. We contribute to the literature on endogenous processing times and highlight the importance of considering behavioral aspects when companies define an implementation strategy and when conducting WLC studies. Furthermore, given that production systems are operated by people, our results show that behavioral effects need to be considered in the specification of workload norms. Based on our results, we conclude that operators exhibit substantial heterogeneity in their reaction behavior, depending on their positioning in a flow shop (gateway station vs. downstream station).

AB  - Submarine periscopes are moving from analog to digital, but there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding the relative advantages that different digital human–machine interface configurations might provide to the operator. We experimentally compared the effectiveness of two digital concepts for displaying and analysing periscope imagery during a simulated submarine mission. OPTIX modelled a traditional periscope by presenting a narrow (20° horizontal arc) rotating image of the horizon. OPTIMUS displayed the full 360° panoramic representation of the horizon and was augmented with digital analysis tools. OPTIMUS supported faster and more accurate performance by participants (N = 32) and lowered perceived workload, compared to when the same participants used OPTIX. However, time taken to respond to situation awareness queries and awareness of one’s own performance (meta-awareness) was poorer when using OPTIMUS. OPTIMUS holds an advantage in that it can improve performance whilst reducing workload, but the SA and meta-awareness decrements are potentially problematic.

AB  - We examined the impact of sharing periscope imagery and analysis tools in eighteen five-member teams (Sonar, Periscope, 2xTrack Motion Analysts, Track Manager) who undertook simulated submarine patrol tasks. Compared to a baseline condition, sharing imagery to team members increased perceived individual workload, with no improvement to team performance (tactical picture accuracy). When both imagery and analysis tools were shared, perceived workload increased and tactical picture compilation was more accurate. Despite this improved tactical picture for the imagery and analysis tools condition, there was no advantage to mission completion (rendezvous/close contact detection) or situation awareness. In contrast to the increased subjective workload, individuals in teams provided with shared imagery (with or without tools) had a lower physiological response (heart rate, electrodermal) to task demands compared to the baseline condition. Sharing imagery and analysis tools likely benefited tactical picture compilation by enabling dynamic task redistribution and multiple streams of concurrent data analysis.

AB  - Due to the lack of accessibility features, the process by which a blind person navigates in space is sometimes regarded as difficult. A large part of the accessibility systems, for the public, are not designed to consider the usage of the blind, which can lead to exclusion. The majority of them must rely on other senses for space location awareness, an example that is followed frequently is the creation of mental maps for certain already-known places. Using the means of transportation, which is a necessary activity for a blind person but uncomplicated for a sighted person, may require studying every move the driver makes in order to accurately determine the present path. Crowdsourcing systems offer the potential to develop a social network through which some of the issues faced by blind people may be resolved. Over time, this leads to the development of a community that fully comprehends the issues and requirements that visually impaired people (VIPs) encounter on a daily basis. With the use of multi-modal feedback interfaces, this effort intends to demonstrate a collaborative system that pairs volunteers with blind persons and guides them along a route. We address the issue of minimizing the cognitive load in addition to the architecture-related issues of such a system by designing a notification system that does not distract the user from their current action.

AB  - Decision aids are commonly used in tactical decision-making environments to help humans integrate base-rate and multi-cue information. However, it is important that users appropriately trust and rely on aids. Decision aids can be presented in many ways, but the literature lacks clarity over the conditions surrounding their effectiveness. This research aims to determine whether a numerical or graphical aid more effectively supports human performance, and explores the relationships between aid presentation, trust, and workload. Participants (N = 30) completed a signal-identification task that required integration of readings from a set of three dynamic gauges. Participants experienced three conditions: unaided, using a numerical aid, and using a graphical aid. The aids combined gauge and base-rate information in a statistically-optimal fashion. Participants also indicated how much they trusted the system and how hard they worked during the task. Analyses explored the impact of aid condition on sensitivity, response bias, response time, trust, and workload. Both the numerical and graphical aids produced significant increases in sensitivity and trust, and significant decreases in workload in comparison to the unaided condition. The difference in response time between the graphical and unaided conditions approached significance, with participants responding faster using the graphical aid without decrements in sensitivity. Significant interactions between aid and signal type indicated that both aided conditions promoted faster responding to non-hostile signals, with larger mean differences in the graphical aid condition. Practically, graphical aids in which suggestions are more salient to users may promote faster responding in tactical environments, with negligible cost of accuracy.

AB  - Neurobiological models indicate that acute stress facilitates bottom-up stimulus processing while impairing top-down executive control. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the effects of acute stress on behavioural and electrophysiological measures of human attentional networks, and behavioural measures of working memory. Forty-five female participants (Mage = 22.1, SD = 2.4) performed the Attention Network Test (ANT) and the n-back task before and after the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST; n = 23) or a non-stressful MAST-placebo (n = 22). Subjective distress ratings and salivary cortisol concentrations revealed a successful stress induction. Increased salivary cortisol at baseline was associated with slower reaction times across both tasks, suggesting a general detrimental effect of cortisol on cognitive functioning. Despite these findings, however, the hypothesised effects of the acute stress manipulation were not found for either task. Supplementary analyses indicated that these results were unrelated to the magnitude or duration of the stress response. Our results therefore suggest the standard version of the ANT may be insensitive to the effects of acute stress, and that higher cognitive loads may be necessary to observe stress effects on the n-back task.

AB  - Manual picking operations commonly occur both in distribution settings and within manufacturing industry and may consume large proportions of the working day for operators, with associated potential problems of poor postural ergonomics and low time efficiency. As a remedy to such problems, alternative material layouts like tilted material pallets may be an attractive solution. This study provides quantitative empirical evidence comparing the relative merits and drawbacks of flat and tilted pallet configurations, with regard to physical ergonomic loading and time consumption. This was explored with an experimental setup at the site of an industrial company, where various representative picking operators were observed while emptying flat and tilted pallets. The observation was video recorded and subjected to a time study and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). Results showed that there are differences in picking time and physical workload depending on where in the pallet the picking action takes place, and that flat and tilted pallets bring different postural opportunities and challenges for different operator percentiles in the working population. An overview of postural ergonomics consequences and their associated risk levels are shown, and the results serve to further increase the understanding of which factors are affected by choosing between a tilted or flat component presentation. This understanding is highly relevant to industry, where it can contribute to the design of both efficient and ergonomically sound processes for manual picking operations.

AB  - The human brain is perpetually active, operating during both work and rest. Excessive mental activity, termed overload, can detrimentally impact health. Advances in predicting mental health conditions aim to prevent severe consequences and improve overall well-being. Consequently, mental status estimation has gained considerable research attention due to its potential benefits. Among the various signals used to assess mental state, the electroencephalogram, with its wealth of brain-related information, is widely employed by researchers. In this paper, we categorize mental workload into three states (low, middle, and high) and estimate a continuum of mental workload levels. Our method leverages information from multiple spatial dimensions (time and frequency domain) to achieve optimal results. In our approach, focusing on the time domain, we utilize Temporal Convolutional Networks to capture temporal information. Meanwhile, in the frequency domain, we implement two distinct branches aimed at acquiring varied information regarding Power Spectral Density by utilizing different lengths of the Fast Fourier Transform. Each branch consists of two blocks, known as the Multi-Dimensional Residual Block, representing a novel architecture by combining residual blocks. The integration of these two domains yields significant results compared to individual estimates in each domain. Our approach achieved a 74.98% accuracy in the three-class classification, surpassing the provided data results at 69.00%. Specially, our method demonstrates efficacy in estimating continuous levels, evidenced by a corresponding Concordance Correlation Coefficient result of 0.629. The combination of time and frequency domain analysis in our approach highlights the exciting potential to improve healthcare applications in the future.

AB  - Optimizing the scheduling of liquid drug product manufacturing is paramount for pharmaceutical companies in their increasingly competitive environment and requires the modelling of industry-specific constraints. Such constraints include: (i) changing sequence-dependent setup times; (ii) maintaining a sterile production environment (e.g., through sterile holding times); (iii) periods with limited or no plant activity (e.g., no workforce during weekends); and (iv) demand timing (i.e., delivery deadline and release date constraints). In this work, an immediate precedence model is formulated to optimize the scheduling of liquid drug product manufacturing, considering the industry-specific constraints. The primary objective is to minimize the production makespan. Four case studies comprising up to 38 batches from a real multi-product facility illustrate the performance of the rigorous optimization approach. The makespan could be reduced by up to 7.9% compared to expert schedules.

AB  - We examined how human mental workload and the corresponding eye movement behaviors are affected by the stages and levels of autonomy in routine and autonomy failure conditions in human-autonomy teams (HAT). Thirty participants performed monitoring and diagnosing tasks with the autonomous agent in a three-factor experiment. The factors included information processing stage, level of autonomy, and agent operation condition. The results indicated that the later the agent-supported information processing stage or the higher the autonomy level, the higher the participants’ mental workload following autonomous agent failure. Compared to the continuous manual operation condition, the HAT performance did not decline following autonomous agent failure at the cost of increased mental workload. The eye movement results indicated a top-down compensatory control mechanism of attention, indicating the risk of team performance decline following autonomous agent failure. These findings can be applied in designing autonomous agents and setting human mental workload levels in a HAT.

AB  - Post-error slowing (PES) – a relative increase in response time for a decision on trialtgiven an error on trialt − 1 – is a well-known effect in studies of human decision-making. Post-error processing is reflected in neural signatures such as reduced activity in sensorimotor regions and increased activity in medial prefrontal cortex. PES is thought to reflect the deployment of executive resources to get task performance back on track. This provides a general account of PES that cuts across perceptual decision-making, memory, and learning tasks. With respect to PES and learning, things are complicated by the fact that learning often reflectsmultiple qualitatively different processes with distinct neural correlates. It is unclear if multiple processes shape PES during learning, or if PES reflects a policy for reacting to errors generated by one particular process (e.g., cortico-striatal reinforcement learning). Here we provide behavioral and computational evidence that PES is influenced by the operation of multiple distinct processes. Human subjects learned a simple visuomotor skill (arbitrary visuomotor association learning) under low load conditionsmore amenable to simple working memory-based strategies, and high load conditions that were putatively more reliant on trial-by-trial reinforcement learning. PES decreased withload, even when the progress of learning (i.e., reinforcement history) was accounted for. This result suggested that PES during learning is influenced by the recruitment of working memory. Indeed, observed PES effects were approximated by a computational model with parallel working memory and reinforcement learning systems that are differentially recruited according to cognitive load.

AB  - In the digital age, coordinating robots and humans is critical in e-commerce warehousing. Motivated by observed industrial practices, this study presents a queueing theory based analytical model to investigate the planning issue of robot-human coordination in a parts-to-picker warehousing system. The critical planning decisions involve finding the optimal number of robots in the warehouse, the expected number of robots at essential locations of the warehouse, and performance analysis of the order picking system. A distinctive feature of this study is the conceptualization of a human factor called perceived workload (which depends on the number of robots) in the order picking planning model for efficient order fulfillment. Our analyses interestingly suggest that deploying more robots in warehouses with a parts-to-picker system does not necessarily increase the warehousing system’s performance; instead, a trade-off exists. Additionally, the workload-dependent service rate significantly influences the robots queueing in front of the order picking station (internal queue) and the synchronization station (external queue) in the warehouse. More importantly, this work contributes to the design of a human-centric work environment for parts-to-picker order fulfillment system.

AB  - Construction companies can accrue losses due to labor fatalities and injuries. Since more than 70% of all accidents are related to human activities, detecting and mitigating human-related risks hold the key to improving the safety conditions within the construction industry. Previous research has revealed that the psychological and emotional conditions of workers can contribute to fatalities and injuries. Recent observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest that inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, laborers are vulnerable to unexpected hazards while focusing on complicated construction tasks. Therefore, the ability to detect the mental conditions of workers could reduce unexpected injuries. However, there are currently no available measurement approaches or devices capable of monitoring construction workers' mental conditions. The research proposed in this paper aims to develop a measurement approach to evaluate hazards through neural time–frequency analysis. The experimental results show that neural signals are valid for mental load assessment of construction workers, especially the low frequency bands signals. The research also describes the development of a prototype for a wearable electroencephalography (EEG) safety helmet that enables the collection of the neural information required as input for the measurement approach.

AB  - Indoor wayfinding poses significant challenges, as navigating complex environments can be difficult and time-consuming. Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges. However, understanding how to effectively leverage AR techniques for large-scale indoor wayfinding scenarios remains unclear. In particular, the implications of AR-enabled egocentric perspectives have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to explore the potential benefits of AR-based egocentric perspectives and their impact on indoor wayfinding performance. A human-subject experiment (N = 31) was conducted in a multi-story building, utilizing a self-developed AR system capable of providing both traditional exocentric and innovative egocentric perspectives. The results of the experiment confirmed the performance and cognitive benefits of the AR-enabled egocentric perspective. Participants using the egocentric perspective demonstrated improved wayfinding efficiency, reduced cognitive load, and enhanced spatial awareness. These findings suggest that the AR-based egocentric perspective offers a more intuitive and effective approach to indoor wayfinding, enabling users to better process spatial information and make informed decisions during wayfinding tasks. The findings are expected to provide empirical evidence on the efficacy of AR systems for wayfinding and inspire new user interface (UI) designs that would better leverage the advantages of AR techniques.

AB  - The rate of human errors would increase as air traffic control officers (ATCOs) lose situation awareness (SA), which could also be affected by their perceived workloads. Recognising ATCOs SA inadequacy is crucial for ensuring traffic safety. This paper aims to propose a two-phase analytical methodology for revealing SA-related neuro-physiological patterns and hierarchically recognising ATCOs SA loss with workload concerns using EEG and eye-tracking data. A simulated air traffic control (ATC) radar-monitoring experiment involving different task loads with SA-probe tests was first conducted to collect behavioural and physiological (EEG and eye-tracking) data simultaneously, and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) scale was used to measure participants’ perceived workloads. In our two-phase methodology, behavioural data representing the task performance was analysed in Phase I using the Gaussian Mixture Model to determine sample’s SA, and the perceived workloads on samples were labelled using NASA-TLX scores. Subsequently, in order to achieve our purposes, the physiological data were annotated based on results from Phase I, the physiological feature base was extracted using a fast Fourier transformation and Hilbert transform in Phase II, and the linear discriminant analysis was then used to extract the core features as inputs to train multiple classifiers. Results showed that the neuro-physiological behaviours of SA loss during normal workloads differed from those in high workload situations. A leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was also performed, and the results demonstrated that the optimal performance was 76.1% for classifying high/low SA (1-Level classification) and 82.7% for recognising low SA associated with high workload (2-Level classification).

AB  - Multitasking is common in emergency, which will result in man-made error due to many factors such as inappropriate Mental Workload (MW). To improve the performance under multitasking, the automatic equipment or assistive systems carry out task/interface optimizations according to the MW evaluation results, and the effectiveness of these technologies depends on how to choose an appropriate MW evaluation model. This paper has developed a performance-based Timed Petri Nets (TPN) model to evaluate MW during multitasking. The concrete functioned places and transitions, were proposed to structure a human resource allocation and recovery processes in TPN. The characteristics of operator are interpreted as initial markings of places and delay of transitions. Task performance is calculated as the difference between the triggering time of two transitions and a behavior process structure, respectively. The real-time MW is quantified and expressed as the remaining percentage of tokens in the attention resource place. A case study of triple-task execution was examined for verification of the model. Furthermore, the distinguishability and stability of the model, its comparison with ACT-R, and the application in task optimization were discussed.
Relevance to industry
The Timed Petri Nets-based model can analyse the influence between mental workload and system states while proposed quantitative and individualized results of mental workload, which can direct a mental workload-based task optimization in safety-critical systems under multitasking in the design phase.

AB  - The timely recovery and disassembly of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) can not only obtain a higher economic benefit but also can reduce the impact of hazardous substances on the environment. The parallel disassembly line can disassemble different kinds of WEEE synchronously and improve disassembly efficiency. Therefore, a parallel partial disassembly line balancing model with stochastic disassembly time is established in this paper. The evaluation indexes of the disassembly line include the number of workstations, workload smoothness, and disassembly profits. A new genetic simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to optimize the model. The encoding and decoding strategies are constructed according to the characteristics of partial disassembly and parallel layout. Two-point mapping crossover and single-point insertion mutation operations are designed to ensure that the disassembly sequence meets the precedence constraints and disassembly constraints. The simulated annealing operation is applied to the results of the genetic operation. The proposed algorithm obtains better solutions than the tabu search algorithm in stochastic parallel assembly line balancing problems, and the proposed algorithm has better performance than the CPLEX solver, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing in parallel disassembly line balancing problems. Finally, a parallel partial disassembly line for waste televisions and refrigerators is constructed, and the performance of the proposed multi-objective algorithm is superior to those of five classical multi-objective algorithms. The results show that the proposed model has a better practical application ability and that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of disassembly lines.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background and Objective
Human walking is typically assessed using a sensor placed on the lower back or the hip. Such analyses often ignore that the arms, legs, and body trunk movements all have significant roles during walking; in other words, these body nodes with accelerometers form a body sensor network (BSN). BSN refers to a network of wearable sensors or devices on the human body that collects physiological signals. Our study proposes that human locomotion could be considered as a network of well-connected nodes.
Methods
While hypothesizing that accelerometer data can model this BSN, we collected accelerometer signals from six body areas from ten healthy participants performing a cognitive task. Machine learning based on genetic programming was used to produce a collection of non-linear symbolic models of human locomotion.
Results
With implications in precision medicine, our primary finding was that our BSN models fit the data from the lower back's accelerometer and describe subject-specific data the best compared to all other models. Across subjects, models were less effective due to the diversity of human sizes.
Conclusions
A BSN relationship between all six body nodes has been shown to describe the subject-specific data, which indicates that the network-medicine relationship between these nodes is essential in adequately describing human walking. Our gait analyses can be used for several clinical applications such as medical diagnostics as well as creating a baseline for healthy walking with and without a cognitive load.

AB  - Teleoperation under human guidance has become an effective solution to extend human’s reach in various environments. However, the teleoperation system still faces challenges of insufficient sense of both visual and haptic feedback from remote environments, which results in the inadequate guidance for the operator. In this paper, a visual/haptic integrated perception and reconstruction system (VHI-PRS) is developed to provide the operator with 3D visual information and effective haptic guidance. Specifically, a visual-based telepresence augmentation method is proposed to provide the operator with virtual-reality combined visual telepresence, where the real point cloud model is directly superimposed on virtual manipulator to avoid the time-consuming process of mesh model rendering. With the utilization of visual information, a haptic-based telepresence augmentation method is proposed to provide the operator with comprehensive force feedback, including the virtual guiding force, virtual repulsive force and real-time interactive force, which greatly helps reduce the workload of operator. Finally, a user study on grab-place task is carried out to verify the effectiveness of proposed system.

AB  - Measuring trust is an important element of effective human-robot collaborations (HRCs). It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.

In the presented case, workers suffered from high cognitive load in doing end-of-line quality inspection and individual handling of a high variety of products. The proposed solution consists of a Spatial Augmented Reality system, where a projector directly displays information on the product to assist the worker. At the same time results of an in-line quality inspections are shown which can be interactively modified through human gestures. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) in contrast to other industrial augmented reality applications the described one technically builds upon a deep neural net based pose estimation. This allows a seamless interaction with the system and tracking of human actions rather than deriving them from the current state of the work piece, (2) the paper recapitulates experiences and results of the approach with a focus on lessons learned for using human pose estimation in smart production.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration promises to free the human to multitask and engage in cognitive work while the robots assists with physical tasks, therefore increasing productivity. However, this collaborative paradigm requires continuous attention from human operators, which could potentially strain their cognitive resources. Excessive attention demands can lead to safety hazards, increased errors, and reduced efficiency. Despite its critical importance, there is limited empirical research on attentional factors in industrial human-robot collaboration. In this study, we explore attentional multitasking in collaborative human-robot assembly settings. Our experimental setup involves participants performing a wire harnessing task with a collaborative robot while simultaneously completing a Go/No-Go test as a secondary task. To observe the effect of multitasking, we varied the difficulty of the secondary task across two levels and analysed its impacts on work performance and workload. Our results confirm threaded cognition theory, suggesting that human-robot collaboration could reduce cognitive capacity by depleting attentional resources, leading to higher errors and cycle times during multitasking. This underscores the importance of a detailed understanding of attentional factors in human-robot collaboration. We discuss our findings and their implications, and provide insights into the adjustment and design of human-robot collaboration tasks in the industry.

AB  - This paper presents an innovative flexible assembly system – hybrid assembly cell lines (HACL) to adapt to small batch, high product variety and dynamic demands. HACL provides specially designed trolleys for assembly operations, materials and tools to form the workstations flexibly and quickly at low reconfiguration cost. To conduct accurate and effective control for this complex assembly system, this paper presents a modified Graduation-inspired Manufacturing System (GMS), a recently proposed new card-based control system. GMS for HACL designs three kinds of tickets and the ticketing mechanism to absorb the uncertainties of HACL. Job tickets are for workload control and synchronization of part deliveries; setup tickets are for cell line formation and synchronization of resources of tools and machines; operation tickets are for production execution and synchronization of workers and operations in cell lines. GMS for HACL develops Internet of Things-enabled (IoT-enabled) architecture for managing the smart tickets to achieve automatic and intelligent interoperability between GMS and the physical workstations of HACL. This work designs synchronization mechanism based on specific model and genetic algorithm to synchronize manufacturing resources under GMS for HACL.

AB  - Self-generated cognition, or mind wandering, refers to the quintessentially human tendency to withdraw from the immediate external environment and engage in internally driven mentation. This thought activity is suggested to be underpinned by a distributed set of regions in the brain, referred to as the default network. To date, experimental assessment of mind wandering has typically taken place during performance of a concurrent attention-demanding task. The attentional demands of concurrent tasks can influence the emergence of mind wandering, and their application to clinical disorders with reduced cognitive resources is limited. Furthermore, few paradigms have investigated the phenomenological content of mind wandering episodes. Here, we present data from a novel thought sampling task that measures both the frequency and qualitative content of mind wandering, in the absence of a concurrent task to reduce cognitive demand. The task was validated in a non-pathological cohort of 31 older controls and resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a subset of participants (n=18) was conducted to explore the neural bases of mind wandering. Overall, instances of mind wandering were found to occur in 37% of experimental trials. Resting state functional connectivity analyses confirmed that mind wandering frequency was associated with regional patterns of both increased and decreased default network connectivity, namely in the temporal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Our findings demonstrate that the novel task provides a context of low cognitive demand, which is conducive to mind wandering. Furthermore, performance on the task is associated with specific patterns of functional connectivity in the default network. Together, this new paradigm offers an important avenue to investigate the frequency and content of mind wandering in the context of low cognitive demands, and has significant potential to be applied in clinical conditions with reduced cognitive resources.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration strategies for agricultural applications are still a challenging research topic that is in its early stages of development. The analysis of the production and physical workload measures during the harvesting process can be useful to obtain relevant information to improve production and farm management. In this work, it is presented the assessment of the avocado harvesting process under different scenarios. For this purpose, two simulation environments were created and compared based on the obtained information from a Chilean farm. The first scenario uses only a human-based workforce to perform all the avocado harvesting-related tasks, whilst the second scenario is based on a human-robot cooperative strategy proposed to improve the harvesting procedure. A total of 41 different tests for each simulated scenario was performed, and then a comparison of them in terms of production and expected human physical workload was obtained. The results showed that the use of a cooperative strategy during harvesting tasks can increase the production measured from the cargo zone from 15% to 80%, as well as the total harvested production from 23% to 85%, whilst the human workload only increases from 1% to 16%. These results enclose the possibility of using production and workload measures as metrics for a human–machine interaction cooperative approach design, in benefit of the harvesting process management and decision making.

AB  - Human-Robot (HR) teams are expected to work more efficiently and interdependently compared to the manual non-added value manufacturing processes. This paper discusses a method for enabling the shared HR task scheduling and dynamic re-scheduling. Humans, robots, and HR teams are involved in the resources model, while the task sequence and the task precedence constraints consist of the workload model. An intelligent multi-criteria decision-making framework is proposed for evaluating alternative solutions for the shared HR task scheduling. Dynamic re-scheduling is possible in the cases of unexpected events during the execution of the task. The dynamic rescheduling is triggered by IEC61499 events generated in running time. The method has been implemented as a software tool in Java and has been demonstrated in the hybrid assembly of a vehicle turbocharger.

AB  - In factories, since various kinds of parts are stocked and used to manufacture products, stocktaking is important in order to keep the appropriate inventory quantity of parts. However, since the number of types of parts is often enormous, their stocktaking workload becomes a heavy burden in such a case. Especially, parts such as bolts and nuts are often stored in bulk containers, and they cannot be counted visually from the outside. So, they must be counted by taking out, and it increases the workload more. On the other hand, image recognition accuracy has been rapidly improved by the deep learning, and its applications to various fields are spreading in recent years. This suggests the automatic stocktaking by using images is possible, especially even for the bulk containers. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of automatic inventory satisfaction discrimination of order point for the parts stocked in the bulk containers. Furthermore, we investigated to apply it to the inventory management system. As a result, we found the precision of this discrimination was higher than a human being when there were many parts in a bulk container; also, we found the more effective inventory management would be possible by using this discrimination together with the data of production management system such as logical inventory.

AB  - To improve working conditions at sorting centers and to reduce the burden, La Poste wants to automate a part of the container-handling process. This mainly concerns containers that belong to the destinations with highest traffic since they demand an important effort and time amount from the operators especially in critical times like truck-departure times, when the operators must quickly load the containers in carts to be transported in trucks so that no delay will occur to the delivery date of the mail items. In this paper, we give a mixed integer linear program to assign the tasks to the robots, in order to maximize the workload of the robots and minimize the effort made by the operators. In addition, a greedy heuristic is proposed. Experiments performed on realistic data confirm the performance of the greedy algorithm. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the heuristic is given to test its robustness on noisy data.

AB  - With the rapid rise in robot presence in a variety of life domains, understanding how robots influence people's emotions during human-robot interactions is important for ensuring their acceptance in society. Mental health care, in particular, is considered the field in which robotics technology will bring the most dramatic changes in the near future. In this context, the present study sought to determine whether a brief cognitive assessment conducted by a robot elicited different interaction-related emotional processes than a traditional assessment conducted by an expert clinician. A non-clinical sample of 29 young adults (17 females; M = 24.5, SD = 2.3 years) were asked to complete two cognitive tasks twice, in counterbalanced order, once administered by an expert clinician and once by an autonomous humanoid robot. Self-reported measures of affective states and assessment of physiological arousal did not reveal any difference in emotional processes between human-human and human-robot interactions. Similarly, cognitive performances and workload did not differ across conditions. Analysis of non-verbal behaviour, however, showed that participants spent more time looking at the robot (d = 1.3) and made fewer gaze aversions (d = 1.3) in interacting with the robot than with the human examiner. We argue that, far from being a trivial ‘cosmetic change’, using a social robot in place of traditional testing could be a potential way to open up the development of a new generation of tests for brief cognitive assessment.

AB  - Today manufacturing enterprises aim not only to deliver high-value, cost-effectively products in a sustainable way, but also to consider the quality of the working environments. The analysis of human factors, which strongly affect time and quality of manufacturing processes, are crucial for satisfying people involved in the manufacturing process and making them safe, preventing diseases, errors and excessive workload. The paper presents a structured procedure to automatically extract data from virtual analysis made by digital manufacturing tools and measure a set of indicators to validly assess manufacturing ergonomics. The research considers the state of the art in manufacturing ergonomics and defines a set of indicators suitable for manufacturing manual operations, focusing on assembly tasks. Furthermore, it defines a methodology to automatically extract data valorising the selected indicators and an application, based on Visual Basic, to generate the specific task list and related assessment. The result is a rapid and objective assessment, independent from the experience of the user, which can be executed during process design. The procedure has been applied to an industrial case study, where the manual assembly of cabin supports on the tractor chassis has been analysed in order to correct the most uncomfortable steps and obtain a more ergonomic process. A decrease of the EAWS score, calculated with the proposed method, allowed to validate the proposed solution, suggesting a redesign of the assembly cycle to improve the working conditions. Such a procedure anticipates the analysis of the workers’ wellbeing during the design stage to support the definition of human-centric manufacturing processes, simplifying and accelerating the assessment activities.

AB  - In recent years, the affordances of immersive technologies in the industrial context have enabled the onsite worker to have increased potential towards handling the complex procedural and cognitive tasks involved in the strategy of manufacturing an appropriate product. This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD.

AB  - Researchers in production and operations management have studied the effect of worker learning and forgetting on system performance for decades. It remains an active research topic. Those studies have assumed that production interruptions (or production breaks) cause forgetting, which deteriorates performance. Research on human working memory provides enough evidence that continuous forgetting, precisely cognitive interference, results from overloading the memory with information. Despite the evidence, few studies have incorporated it into learning curve models. This paper presents an enhanced version of the power learning curve that accounts for a variable degree of interference when moving from a production cycle to the next. It adopts the concept of memory trace decay to measure the residual (interference-adjusted), not the nominal (maximum) cumulative experience. We test the developed model against learning data from manual assembly and inspection tasks, with varying numbers of repetitions and breaks. We also test three alternative power-form learning and forgetting curve models from the literature. The results show that the interference-adjusted model fits the data very well. The proposed learning and forgetting model and its individualized cumulative metrics can help identify struggling workers early and release precocious learners earlier than expected. As such, the model gives insights for managers on the occurrence of interference to enable individual learning support.

AB  - Modern manufacturing environment is very stressful for operators in charge of the production process. Unexpected events may deteriorate their performance by increasing their stress and workload. To help them, several tools have been developed. Nowadays, these decision support systems (DSS) are assumed to reduce operators’ workload and stress because they automatically reschedule the production by applying algorithms. However, from a neuroergonomic perspective, findings remain equivocal. The effect of DSS has only been reported at a subjective level. As modern manufacturing environment is increasingly using intelligent systems like DSS to help operators in their decisions, it is important to understand how they can contribute to improve operators’ performance. We aim to present a graphic interface and its associated experimental protocol investigating the operators’ mental state using DSS and facing disruptions within a neuroergonomic perspective

AB  - Abstract
Existing augmented reality (AR) assembly mainly provides visual instructions for operators from a first-person perspective, and it is hard to share individual working intents for co-located workers on the shop floor, especially for large-scale product assembly task that requires multiple operators working together. To bridge this gap for practical deployments, this paper proposes Co2iAR, a co-located audio-visual enabled mobile collaborative AR assembly. Firstly, according to the stereo visual-inertial fusion strategy, robust and accurate self-contained motion tracking is achieved for the resource-constrained mobile AR platform, followed by a co-located alignment from multiple mobile AR clients on the shop floor. Then, a lightweight text-aware network for online wiring harness character recognition is proposed, as well as the audio-based confirming strategy, enabling natural audio-visual interaction among co-located workers within a shared immersive workplace, which can also monitor the current wiring assembly status and activate the step-by-step tutorials automatically. The novelty of this work is focused on the deployment of audio-visual aware interaction using the same device that is being used to deploy the co-located collaborative AR work instructions, establishing shared operating intents among multiple co-located workers. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out on the collaborative performance among multiple AR clients, and results illustrate that the proposed Co2iAR can alleviate the cognitive load and achieve superior performance for the co-located AR assembly tasks, providing a more human-centric collaborative assembly performance.

AB  - Warehouses are important nodes in almost every supply chain. Within warehouses, order picking is a crucial task that is extremely time- and cost-intensive. While order picking systems (OPSs) have traditionally been operated manually, new technologies offer opportunities for reducing the workload of warehouse workers. These technologies include autonomous picking robots that can function in combination with human pickers within a shared workspace. This technology enables human–robot collaboration and enhances flexibility in system design, as robots can either support humans or work independently. Research on the advantages of these hybrid OPSs (HOPSs) for improving operational performance is still scarce, however. To contribute to closing this research gap, we propose an agent-based simulation model to investigate how HOPSs reduce the daily workload of human order pickers. The results reveal that HOPSs – if certain assignment rules for the picking tasks are considered – can reduce both the operational costs of the system and human workload compared to a pure manual or a fully automated OPS. Nonetheless, attention should be paid to control the item weight pickers are supposed to handle, as HOPSs reduce the travel distance of human pickers, resulting in a higher frequency of picking activities and an increased ergonomic risk for musculoskeletal disorders.

AB  - Background and Objective
Operator's capability for accurately comprehending verbal commands is critically important to maintain the performance of human-machine interaction. It can be evaluated by human mental workload measured with electroencephalography (EEG). However, the time duration of different workload conditions within a task session is unequal due to varied psychophysiological processes across individuals. It leads to data imbalance of the EEG for training workload classifiers.
Methods
In this study, we propose an EEG feature oversampling technique, Gaussian-SMOTE based feature ensemble (GSMOTE-FE), for workload recognition with imbalanced classes. First, artificial EEG instances are drawn from a Gaussian distribution in the margin between the minority and majority workload classes. Tomek links are detected as clues to remove redundant feature vectors. Then, we embed a feature selection module based on the GINI importance while an ensemble classifier committee with bootstrap aggregating is used to further enhance classification performance.
Results
We validate the GSMOTE-FE framework based on an experiment that simulates operators to understand the correct meaning of the instructions in the Chinese language. Participants’ EEG signals and reaction time data were both recorded to validate the proposed workload classifier. Workload classification accuracy and Macro-F1 values are 0.6553 and 0.5862, respectively. Corresponding G-mean and AUC achieve at 0.5757 and 0.5958, respectively.
Conclusions
The performance of the GSMOTE-FE is demonstrated to be comparable with the advanced oversampling techniques. The workload classifier has the capability to indicate low and high levels of the task demand of the Chinese language understanding task.

Given the research highlights on platform-based manufacturing service collaboration (MSC) offering high-quality service solutions, efficient service scheduling strategies are urgently needed to maximize overall utility amidst great computational complexity and unpredictable task arrivals. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel distributed online task dispatch and service scheduling (DOTDSS) strategy in platform-aggregated MSC. What sets our method apart is its goal to optimize a long-term average utility performance with considering queuing dynamics of manufacturing services in multi-task processing, thereby maintaining sustainable platform operations. Firstly, we jointly consider task dispatch and service scheduling decisions into the formulation of a quality-of-service aware (QoS) stochastics optimization problem. The newly constructed logarithmic utility function effectively strikes a trade-off between the throughput and capacity utilization of manufacturing services with diverse capabilities. By incorporating the goal of reducing queue lengths, we then transform the optimization problem into a form with less computational complexity and guaranteed optimality using Lyapunov optimization. We further propose a DOTDSS strategy that relies solely on the current system state and queue information to generate scalable MSC solutions. It does not need to predict task arrival statistics in advance, and it exhibits great adaptability to uncertainties in task arrivals and service availabilities. Finally, numerical results based on simulation data and real workload traces demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It also shows that the aggregation collaboration pattern among a group of candidates can achieve better performance than that by the optimal candidate alone.

AB  - Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (FJSSP) is a challenging optimization problem with multiple conflicting objectives used to model and compute real-world process scheduling tasks. In order for a manufacturing system to remain competitive, it is necessary to compute such optimization problems quickly and efficiently. The limitations of conventional optimization methods frequently stem from a delicate balance between solution quality and computation time. Consequently, a pressing need for solution algorithms arises that can effectively transcend these limitations. This paper presents a novel Quantum Annealing-based solving algorithm (QASA) for computing FJSSP, leveraging the power of Quantum Annealing combined with classical techniques. The proposed approach aims to optimize a multi-criterial FJSSP considering makespan, total workload, and job priority simultaneously. QASA employs a Hamiltonian formulation with Lagrange parameters to integrate the problem's constraints and objectives. By assigning appropriate weights to the objectives, the method allows the prioritization of certain objectives over others. To handle the computational complexity of large FJSSP instances, the problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, and a decision logic based on bottleneck factors is employed to select critical jobs for computation combined with variable pruning techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on benchmark problems, considering makespan, total workload, and priority objectives. Therefore, QASA combining tabu search, simulated annealing, and Quantum Annealing is used for efficient computation and is compared with a classical solving algorithm (CSA) combining tabu search and simulated annealing. The results demonstrate that QASA outperforms CSA in terms of solution quality, as measured by set coverage and hypervolume ratio metrics. Furthermore, computational efficiency analysis reveals that QASA achieves superior Pareto solutions compared to the classical approach, with a reasonable increase in computation time.

AB  - Eye response measurement is one of the objective measure methods and useful for assessing of operators' mental workload (MWL). The main objectives of this paper are to consider the relationship between operators' MWL and eye responses in the task of operating marine engine interface. Also, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict the operators' MWL based on integrating eye response data. Eye response indices (pupil dilation, blink rate, fixation rate, and saccadic rate) were recorded, and two subjective rating methods (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Task Load Index [NASA-TLX] and subjective workload assessment technique [SWAT]) were used for 27 participants. The results again confirm that the eye response is sensitive to MWL in workload levels of the task when using the interface control. The ANN model developed by measuring these indices can predict the operators' MWL with the determination coefficient (R2) of 0.971, 0.912 and 0.918 for training, validation, and testing, respectively. These results indicated that the ANN approach is quite accurate for the prediction of operators' MWL based on eye response indices.
Relevance to industry
The developed model is expected to provide the operator with a reference value of their MWL by evaluating their physiological indices. This result might be applied for developing an intelligent prediction model in the actual work environment to inform or support the operator in a variety of ways. From this, the manager can organize the human resources for each task to sustain the appropriate MWL as well as to improve the work performance.

It also noted that the use of faculty workload as a motivator; and measure of performance is faced with controversies typically emanating from the inability to determine the role of the variable in studies involving the use of it.

KW  - Cloud manufacturing
KW  - Multi-task scheduling
KW  - Task workload
AB  - Cloud manufacturing is an emerging service-oriented business model that integrates distributed manufacturing resources, transforms them into manufacturing services, and manages the services centrally. Cloud manufacturing allows multiple users to request services at the same time by submitting their requirement tasks to a cloud manufacturing platform. The centralized management and operation of manufacturing services enable cloud manufacturing to deal with multiple manufacturing tasks in parallel. An important issue with cloud manufacturing is therefore how to optimally schedule multiple manufacturing tasks to achieve better performance of a cloud manufacturing system. Task workload provides an important basis for task scheduling in cloud manufacturing. Based on this idea, we present a cloud manufacturing multi-task scheduling model that incorporates task workload modelling and a number of other essential ingredients regarding services such as service efficiency coefficient and service quantity. Then we investigate the effects of different workload-based task scheduling methods on system performance such as total completion time and service utilization. Scenarios with or without time constraints are separately investigated in detail. Results from simulation experiments indicate that scheduling larger workload tasks with a higher priority can shorten the makespan and increase service utilization without decreasing task fulfilment quality when there is no time constraint. When time constraint is involved, the above strategy enables more tasks to be successfully fulfilled within the time constraint, and task fulfilment quality also does not deteriorate.

AB  - This study evaluated the power and sensitivity of several core driver workload measures in order to better understand their use as a component of future driver distraction potential evaluation procedures of the in-vehicle human machine interface (HMI). Driving is a task that requires visual, manual and cognitive resources to perform. Secondary tasks, such as mobile phone use and interaction with in-built navigation, which load onto any of these three processing resources increase driver workload and can lead to impaired driving. Because workload and distraction potential are interrelated, a comprehensive method to assess driver workload that produces valid and predictive results is needed to advance the science of distraction potential evaluation. It is also needed to incorporate into New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) testing regimes. Workload measures of cognitive (DRT [Detection Response Task] Reaction Time), visual (DRT Miss Rate), subjective (NASA-TLX [driver workload questionnaire]), and temporal demand (Task Interaction Time) were collected as participants drove one of 40 vehicles while completing a variety of secondary tasks with varying interaction requirements. Of the evaluated measures, variance and power analyses demonstrated that Task Interaction Time is the most sensitive in detecting differences in driver workload between different in-vehicle HMIs, followed by DRT Miss Rate, NASA-TLX and finally DRT Reaction Time. There were relatively weak correlations between each of the four measures. These results suggest that Task Interaction Time, coupled with a reliable visual demand metric such as DRT Miss Rate, eye glance coding, or visual occlusion, more efficiently detect differences in driver workload between different HMIs compared to DRT Reaction Time and the NASA-TLX questionnaire. These results can be used to improve the understanding of the utility of each of these core driver workload measures in assessing driver distraction potential.

AB  - To achieve the objective of smart manufacturing, the adoption of cloud computing is inevitable. However, the implications of fully or partially moving the manufacturing-related workloads to the cloud is a strategic decision that is rarely investigated thoroughly enough in the literature, especially for standard off-the-shelf enterprise IT applications, such as various SAP products. Specifically, in the related research, it is kept on a high level of conceptual representation without analysis of the specific cloud products required for such infrastructure. In this work, we discuss cloud setup for smart manufacturing while taking into account four main pillars of cloud infrastructure required for standard IT solutions, namely: compute, storage, networking, and backups. We also consider different degrees of high availability requirements since these fundamentally impact how cloud architecture should be designed. After discussing these elements, we demonstrate how these elements are mapped to the real-world cloud offerings on the example use case of Microsoft Azure. We close the paper with a discussion on further consideration of operational costs while pointing out the complexity of the pricing model.

AB  - Intelligence has long been associated with chronometric performance measures, such as reaction time (RT); however, few studies have investigated this relation in humans at the lower end of the intelligence range. The purpose of this study is to examine the inter-relation between RT, and intelligence in the population of athletes with mild to moderate (IQ 40–75) intellectual impairment (II), according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. IQ-scores were retrieved from the athlete-database, assessed prior to the study by means of the most recently standardized versions of the Stanford-Binet, Raven Progressive Matrices or Wechsler Intelligence Scales, i.e., WISC-V or WAIS-IV. Three RT tasks with increasing cognitive load were administered in this study. The sample consisted of 103 young individuals (32% females, mean age=24.4years, SD=5.8) with II (mean IQ=60.6, SD=9.2), performing the tests prior to competing in the Global Games; the highest level of sport competition, organized by the International Federation for Intellectual Disability Sport. We tested whether IQ and RT were correlated in this sample by means of Pearson's correlations. Afterwards, a comparison sample of tertiary education students was recruited (n=103; mean age=21.1, SD=2.4), whereby for each individual participant with II, a peer was selected on the basis of equal gender, practicing the same sport, and equal accumulated sport expertise. We focused on the possibility that RT tasks requiring higher cognitive load differentiate more between the samples. The 2×3 ANOVA demonstrated a significant group (athletes with II versus comparison group) by task (simple RT, choice RT, complex RT) interaction effect, indicating that the progression of RTs increase across the three tasks with increasing complexity, was more pronounced in the athletes with II than in the comparison sample. This is the first study investigating RT in a large sample of well-trained active individuals with II. It provides a benchmark for other studies and suggests that the impact of lower levels of intelligence on RT is most apparent in RT tasks with the highest cognitive load.

SQLShare is a database-as-a-service platform targeting scientists and data scientists with minimal database experience, whose workload was made available to the research community. According to the authors of Jain et al. (2016) , this workload is the only one containing primarily ad-hoc hand-written queries over user-uploaded datasets. In this paper we analyze this workload, by comparing users’ explorations (sequences of queries), looking for common SQL operations performed by the users during data analysis and studying query complexity. We use a clustering algorithm to retrieve groups of similar explorations and we analyze the obtained clusters through many statistical and visual indicators for explaining analysis patterns inside clusters. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to characterize human analysis behavior in SQL workloads.

AB  - The extended international development of the automotive industry has been supported in a part by crossdocking platforms set up between distant manufacturing plants and nearby first-tier suppliers. A cross-dock centre is an intermediate consolidation point in a supply chain linking a set of suppliers with a set of customers. Main advantages are a reduced lead time, a decrease of stock level and economies in transportation. At shop-floor, packages from inbound trucks are unloaded, moved across, sorted by destination and loaded onto outbound trucks. A case of study at Renault company is presented in this paper. Two important points are observed for this Renault crossdock center: (1) repackaging operations are performed for some products and (2) due to the high diversity of packages' dimensions and stacking rules, scheduling of inbound, repackaging and loading outbound trucks is a complex problem. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to schedule inbound trucks' arrival times (considering given soft time windows), shop-floor repackaging operations and outbound trucks' departure times. Capacitated temporary storage zones and a capacitated repack workshop are considered at crossdock shop-floor. The model seeks to minimize penalty costs related to inbound trucks' arrival times and consequently unbalanced workload of the repack workshop. Implemented in CPLEX and tested on some instances provided by Renault, results of numerical experiments show the efficiency and pertinence of the model in the given industrial context.

The system aims to enhance knowledge capitalization and decision-support processes by helping user to navigate through complex RDF knowledge graphs in an intuitive manner. By facilitating the physical navigation of virtual space with its multi-modal interactions such as gestures, movements, and voice commands; AIDEN allows technical data readily accessible to non-experts. This immersive approach takes advantage of humans’ innate ability to interact with three-dimensional environments, thereby enhancing the user experience by reducing cognitive load while exploiting the potential of a third dimension for data visualization purposes. Two distinct knowledge graph representations have been designed to optimize navigation and user experience. The first type, the "overall view," is designed for pattern recognition and group identification. The second, called "immersive view," submerges the user into the graph for a more local perspective, enhancing the readability of individual node relationships. This paper discusses the design and implementation of AIDEN and explores its potential to improve the way to interact with complex data structures.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse and compare the impact of the choice of the release method in a hybrid make-to-order (MTO)–finish-to-order (FTO) production system composed of two stages. The study is motivated by a practical problem from the aluminium profiles manufacturing industry, where for shortening throughput times it is allowed to start production of standard and regular items without confirmed orders, holding a stock of semi-finished products. The first stage manufactures both, items to order and items to a stock of semi-finished products, while the second stage is a customization stage based on customer demand requests and specifications. The paper addresses the questions of where order release control should be exercised, i.e., at only one stage or at both stages, and when should it be exercised. Simulation results suggest that load-based order release can be successfully applied to this hybrid production system when combined with a replenishment control policy for semi-finished products. Load-based order release contributes to reduce the total throughput time and the percentage of tardy orders of both, MTO and FTO, while contributing to a reduction of the semi-finished products inventory levels required to achieve a given fill rate. The study is a contribution toward the alignment of workload control theory to industrial practice.

AB  - Evaluations of our acoustical environment depend on sound characteristics as well as on factors attributable to the person and situation. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of the listener’s attentional state and cognitive load, temporal characteristics of environmental sounds, and potential interaction effects on overall retrospective sound evaluations. Sixty-three test participants were presented six two-minute recordings of environmental sounds, whereby the temporal position of one occurring sound peak or valley was varied. The experimental group was distracted from the test sounds and cognitively loaded by performing the Stroop Test during the sound presentation and retrospectively rated the sounds in terms of loudness and pleasantness. In contrast, the control group attentively listened to the sounds and rated them during and after listening. Results showed that participants in the experimental group rated the sounds on average as 6.7% more pleasant than the participants of the control group. Moreover, previous findings on the influence of the peak position on the retrospective judgments (recency effect) were replicated; however, no effect of the temporal position of sound valleys was found. Retrospective judgments in the control group could further be predicted by the averaged momentary judgment, the linear trend over time as well as the momentary judgment during the peak and the end. Findings thus emphasize the need of taking into account human (in)attention and memory processes when assessing complex environmental sounds.

AB  - This study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates essential manufacturing and supply chain functions. These functions encompass process planning, scheduling, due-date assignment, and delivery optimization. The objective of this integrated approach is to achieve multiple benefits, including balanced workload distribution, enhanced company performance, generation of more realistic planning schedules, and ultimately, the achievement of shorter due dates. As a result, the overall efficiency of operations is substantially improved, with approximately a 50 % increase over isolated function management. Additionally, the isolated integration of the delivery function within systems comprising three integrated functions has been found to improve efficiency by 18%. The study employs various heuristic techniques, including genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, random search, hybrid search, and evolutionary strategy, to assess the optimal solution method and rules for these functions. The Taguchi technique is employed to ascertain the optimal values for critical parameters, such as population size, mutation rate, crossover points, and random search rate. Among the solution methods investigated, genetic algorithms consistently yielded superior results Additionally, the weighted slack rule consistently exhibited notable effectiveness compared to other due-date assignment rules. Similarly, the savings algorithm outperformed other delivery optimization rules. However, it is important to note that among the scheduling rules evaluated, none has emerged as dominant.

AB  - Although the objective assessment of mental workload has been a focus of human factors research, few studies have investigated stakeholders' attitudes towards its implementation in real workplaces. The present study addresses this research gap by surveying N = 702 managers in three European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, Spain) about their expectations and concerns regarding sensor-based monitoring of employee mental workload. The data confirm the relevance of expectations regarding improvements of workplace design and employee well-being, as well as concerns about restrictions of employees' privacy and sovereignty, for the implementation of workload monitoring. Furthermore, Bayesian regression models show that the examined expectations have a substantial positive association with managers’ willingness to support workload monitoring in their company. Privacy concerns are identified as a significant barrier to the acceptance of workload monitoring, both in terms of their prevalence among managers and their strong negative relationship with monitoring support.

Most adaptive interaction systems are always activated according to the pilot’s current workload state. However, the pilot may already lose important information during a high workload, and thus the corresponding reaction of the adaptive interaction system would lag. Moreover, most adaptive interaction systems adopt the expert’s knowledge as a reference to generate information. Still, the tacit knowledge that reveals the information interrelationship is seldom studied, despite being the foundation of the interactive information display. To solve the above problems, we proposed an adaptive interaction system architecture with three subsystems. Firstly, we developed a workload level prediction subsystem, where physiological parameters are used to predict future workload levels, thus avoiding interaction system lag; Secondly, we developed a tacit expert knowledge mining subsystem to discover the interrelationship hidden in the expert’s perceived information, which will guide the interactive information interface. Thirdly, we developed a tips information inference subsystem to provide the lost SA information based on expert knowledge and the pilot’s online perceived information. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified via a comparative experiment utilizing the control interface of a remotely piloted aircraft.

AB  - Several widely implemented educational approaches aim to provide academic content in a foreign language. While Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) works because it focuses both on content and on foreign language learning, approaches aiming at transmitting academic content through a foreign language should not be implemented without explicit foreign language instructional support. Based on cognitive load theory, there are theoretical reasons to hypothesize that exposure to new content in a foreign language without any foreign language instructional support may interfere with rather than facilitate learning compared to learning language and content separately. In three experiments conducted in higher education, a text was presented to 294 students in three different conditions: native language, foreign language, and foreign language with a translation into the native language. We varied the foreign language (English, German) and the domain (Law, Computer Science). Our results indicated that reading in the foreign language was never the best condition to learn either language or academic content. We concluded that considerable care should be taken when transmitting academic content in a foreign language, without explicit foreign language instructional support.

AB  - Thermal metamaterial has recently garnered increasing attention for manipulating heat flows and enabling diverse thermal functionalities. The conventional strategy to design thermal metamaterials is to use layered configurations and other structural layouts, whose design space is limited or the workload is heavy. A repeated design or optimization process is needed to retrieve desired architectures that occupy target thermal conductivity. Here, we propose an intelligent design approach (automatic and customized) as the alternative to conceiving thermal metamaterials by combining size optimization with deep learning. We show that this approach can generate desired mixture architectures that cover the full-parameter anisotropic space, with exceptional accuracy, speed, and efficiency. Transformation-induced thermal meta-devices can be constructed directly by assembling retrieved mixture architectures, regardless of the thermal functionalities. Different metadevices are designed and verified by simulations and experiments, demonstrating the feasibility and versatility of this strategy. The formulated method increases the design efficiency and holds better manufacturability, which holds promise for other physical fields, e.g., acoustics and mass diffusion.

AB  - Recently, Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) has emerged as a potential modality that utilizes natural and intuitive human mechanisms of thinking process to enable interactions in CAD interfaces. Before BCI could become a mainstream mode of HCI for CAD interfaces; fundamental studies directed towards understanding how humans mentally represent and process the geometry are needed. The outlined work in this paper presents an objective user study to understand shape recognition process in the humans. Specifically, we focus on the fundamental task of fragmentary shape identification. The problem of fragmentary shape recognition can be defined as follows: given a partial and incomplete minimalistic representation of a given shape, can one recognize the actual complete shape or object? In user studies, each subject was progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of an object to be recognized. During each stage of the experiment, the brain activity of users in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded with a BCI headset. The recorded signals are then processed to objectively study the fragmentary shape recognition process. The results of user studies conclusively show that the measured brain activities of subjects can serve as a very accurate proxy to estimate subjects fragmentary shape recognition process.

AB  - Background
People living with multimorbidity in economically precarious circumstances in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience a high workload trying to meet self-management demands. However, in countries such as South Africa, the availability of social networks and support structures may improve patient capacity, especially when networks are governed by cultural patterns linked to the Pan-African philosophy of Ubuntu, which promotes solidarity through humanness and human dignity. We explore the mediating role Ubuntu plays in people's ability to self-manage HIV/NCD multimorbidity in underprivileged settings in urban and rural South Africa.
Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 patients living with HIV/NCD multimorbidity between February–April 2022. Patients attended public health clinics in Gugulethu, Cape Town and Bulungula, Eastern Cape. We analysed interviews using framework analysis, using the Cumulative Complexity Model (CuCoM) and Burden of Treatment Theory (BoTT) as frameworks through which to conceptualise the data.
Results
Despite facing economic hardship, people with multimorbidity in South Africa were able to cope with their workload. They actively used and mobilized family relations and external networks that supported them financially, practically, and emotionally, allowing them to better self-manage their chronic conditions. Embedded in their everyday life, patients, often unconsciously, embraced Ubuntu and its core values, including togetherness, solidarity, and receiving Imbeko (respect) from health workers. This enabled participants to share their treatment workload and increase self-management capacity.
Conclusion
Ubuntu is an important mediator for people living with multimorbidity in South Africa, as it allows them to navigate their treatment workload and increase their social capital and structural resilience, which is key to self-management capacity. Incorporating Ubuntu and linked African support theories into current treatment burden models will enable better understandings of patients’ collective support and can inform the development of context-specific social health interventions that fit the needs of people living with chronic conditions in African settings.

AB  - The capability of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to track and visualize relations of objects in space has led to diverse industry applications to support complex engineering tasks. Object assembly is one of them. For an AR aid to support Ready-to-Assemble (RTA) furniture particularly, the challenge is to effectively design the visual features and mode of interaction, so that the first-time users can quickly conceive spatial relations of its parts. However, AR developers and engineers do not have sufficient guidelines to achieve such performance-driven goals. The scientific evidence and account of how one could cognitively benefit in object assembly can be useful to guide them. This experimental research developed an Augmented Reality (AR) application on the Microsoft HoloLens™ headset, and tested it on the first-time users of RTA furniture. The controlled experiments and behavioral analyses of fourteen participants in working out the two RTA furniture with different assembly complexity showed that, the application was effective to improve spatial problem-solving abilities. Especially, the positive effects of the AR-based supports stood out against the assembly of higher complexity. The findings have implications for the information design of advanced AR applications to support assembly tasks with high demands of spatial knowledge. In addition, the extensive analyses of the participants’ performance, behaviors, cognitive workload, and subjective responses helped identify usability issues with the Microsoft HoloLens™.

AB  - In brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), the user mental constrains and the cognitive workload involved are frequently overlooked. These factors are aggravated by neuromuscular dysfunction, collateral complications, and side effects of medication in motor-impaired people. We therefore proposed to develop a simulated living-environment platform (SLEP) that was tailored to severely paralyzed people and also allowed the progressive user–system adaptation through increasingly demanding scenarios. This platform consisted of a synchronous motor imagery based BCI system, an everyday assistive computer program, and a virtual dwelling place. The SLEP was tested in 11 healthy users, where the user–system adaptation was evaluated according to the BCI accuracy for classifying the user control tasks. The user heart rate was also incorporated in the evaluation in order to verify the progressiveness of such adaptation. The results of this study showed that user performance tended to increase from the least to the most challenging scenario in learning situations. The results also showed that nine of the eleven users controlled the BCI system in cue-driven mode, completing over half of the tasks. Two of the eleven users controlled the BCI system in target-driven mode, completing two tasks. Taken together, these results suggest that the progressive adaptation in BCI systems can enhance the performance, the persistence and the confidence of the users, even when they are immersed in simulated daily-living situations.

AB  - According to the limited resources paradigm, prior cognitive effort should result in a temporary depletion of available cognitive resources (Kahneman, 1973). Some recent evidence however has proved an opposite effect of increment in the availability of cognitive resources as a function of prior cognitive effort. In the current study the follow-up effect of cognitive effort on sustained attention was examined. Eighty-nine participants took part in the experiment. The cognitive load was manipulated between subjects using three versions of the DIVA Task (intensive warming-up condition, moderate warming-up condition and the control one). Following the experimental manipulation, the availability of cognitive resources during vigilance task was checked. Some significant effects of experimental manipulation were observed. First, in the context of overall task performance, subjects from the intensive warming-up condition obtained lower total errors rate than subjects from the control one. Some moderate effect of cognitive warming-up on time-on-task performance was also observed, although it was isolated to false alarms rate. Those results, tentatively suggesting the occurrence of the cognitive warming-up effect in vigilance performance, are then discussed.
