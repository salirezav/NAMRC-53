AB  - The morphological analysis of cells from optical images is vital for interpreting brain function in disease states. Extracting comprehensive cell morphology from intricate backgrounds, common in neural and some medical images, poses a significant challenge. Due to the huge workload of manual recognition, automated neuron cell segmentation using deep learning algorithms with labeled data is integral to neural image analysis tools. To combat the high cost of acquiring labeled data, we propose a novel semi-supervised cell segmentation algorithm for immunofluorescence-stained cell image datasets (ISC), utilizing a mean-teacher semi-supervised learning framework. We include a “cross comparison representation learning block” to enhance the teacher–student model comparison on high-dimensional channels, thereby improving feature compactness and separability, which results in the extraction of higher-dimensional features from unlabeled data. We also suggest a new network, the Multi Pooling Layer Attention Dense Network (MPAD-Net), serving as the backbone of the student model to augment segmentation accuracy. Evaluations on the immunofluorescence staining datasets and the public CRAG dataset illustrate our method surpasses other top semi-supervised learning methods, achieving average Jaccard, Dice and Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) indicators of 83.22%, 90.95% and 81.90% with only 20% labeled data.

AB  - The last twenty years have seen the development of gaze-controlled computer interfaces for augmentative communication and other assistive technology applications. In many applications, the user needs to look at symbols on a virtual on-screen keyboard and maintain gaze to make a selection. Executive control is essential to learning to use gaze-control, affecting the uptake of the technology. Specifically, the user of a gaze-controlled interface must suppress looking for its own sake, the so-called “Midas touch” problem. In a pre-registered study (https://osf.io/2mak4), we tested whether gaze-typing performance depends on executive control and whether learning-dependent plasticity leads to improved executive control as measured using the antisaccade task. Forty-two university students were recruited as participants. After five 30-min training sessions, we found shorter antisaccade latencies in a gaze-control compared to a mouse-control group, and similar error-rates. Subjective workload ratings were also similar across groups, indicating the task in both groups was matched for difficulty. These findings suggest that executive control contributes to gaze-typing performance and leads to learning-induced plasticity.

AB  - In recent years, the significant growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought a lot of attention to information and communication industry. Various IoT paradigms like the Internet of Vehicle Things (IoVT) and the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) create massive volumes of data every day which consume a lot of bandwidth and storage. However, to process such large volumes of data, the existing cloud computing platforms offer limited resources due to their distance from IoT devices. Consequently, cloud-computing systems produce intolerable latency problems for latency-sensitive real-time applications. Therefore, a new paradigm called fog computing makes use of computing nodes in the form of mobile devices, which utilize and process the real-time IoT devices data in orders of milliseconds. This paper proposes workload-aware efficient resource allocation and load balancing in the fog-computing environment for the IoHT. The proposed algorithmic framework consists of the following components: task sequencing, dynamic resource allocation, and load balancing. We consider electrocardiography (ECG) sensors for patient's critical tasks to achieve maximum load balancing among fog nodes and to measure the performance of end-to-end delay, energy, network consumption and average throughput. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated using the iFogSim tool, and results with the existing approach have been conducted. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed technique achieves a 45% decrease in delay, 37% reduction in energy consumption, and 25% decrease in network bandwidth consumption compared to the existing studies.

AB  - As the Internet of Things (IoT) industry expands, the demand for microprocessors and microcontrollers used in IoT systems has increased steadily. Benchmarks provide a valuable reference for processor evaluation. Different IoT application scenarios face different data scales, dimensions, and types. However, the current popular benchmarks only evaluate the processor’s performance under fixed data formats. These benchmarks cannot adapt to the fragmented scenarios faced by processors. This paper proposes a new benchmark, namely IoTBench. The IoTBench workloads cover three types of algorithms commonly used in IoT applications: matrix processing, list operation, and convolution. Moreover, IoTBench divides the data space into different evaluation subspaces according to the data scales, data types, and data dimensions. We analyze the impact of different data types, data dimensions, and data scales on processor performance and compare ARM with RISC-V and MinorCPU with O3CPU using IoTBench. We also explored the performance of processors with different architecture configurations in different evaluation subspaces and found the optimal architecture of different evaluation subspaces.

AB  - Large data centers are usually built to support increasing computational and data storage demand of growing global business and industry, which consume an enormous amount of energy, at a huge cost to both business and the environment. However, much of that energy is wasted to maintain excess service capacity during periods of low load. In this paper, we investigate the problem of “right-sizing” data center for energy-efficiency through virtualization which allows consolidation of workloads into smaller number of servers while dynamically powering off the idle ones. In view of the dynamic nature of data centers, we propose a stochastic model based on Queueing theory to capture the main characteristics. Solving this model, we notice that there exists a tradeoff between the energy consumption and performance. We hereby develop a BFGS based algorithm to optimize the tradeoff by searching for the optimal system parameter values for the data center operators to “right-size” the data centers. We implement our Stochastic Right-sizing Model (SRM) and deploy it in the real-world cloud data center. Experiments with two real-world workload traces show that SRM can significantly reduce the energy consumption while maintaining high performance.

AB  - Industrial non-contact dimensional measurements using photogrammetry rely critically upon stability in time of camera calibration. This is particularly relevant for multi-camera systems employed for continuous and/or long term monitoring of some dimensional process, e.g. dimensional checks of the same manufactured component as it comes off the production line. In most of these cases, camera calibration is updated regularly to ensure optimal accuracy. Specifically, the use of photogrammetric systems requires the knowledge of both internal and external camera parameters estimated by calibration. Constancy of both sets is required during use. Internal parameters, pertaining to camera-specific properties, require stability over the operational lifespan of the system, while external parameters, concerning location and orientation, may change between calibrations. A diagnostic method for internal parameters based on multivariate control charts is proposed. The purpose of this method is to provide a comprehensive stability control over all the performed calibrations, especially for those systems used for regular monitoring of production lines. By integrating chart building into calibration software, no additional steps are added to the operator's workload for the calibration process. A practical application of the described methodology is presented at the end of the paper.

AB  - The emergence of B2C e-commerce in the last decade is currently transforming the way warehouses fulfill online orders with just a few line items, broad and variable product assortments, varying workloads and extremely short delivery schedules. In this new business reality, order picking stands out as the most labor intensive, strenuous, time constrained, repetitive, prone to error and expensive process in the contemporary warehouse. These characteristics undoubtedly put significant strain to the human worker (picker) creating both body fatigue and feelings of monotony and dissatisfaction usually leading to employee underperformance and demotivation. In this paper, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey to supervisors and pickers from different large distribution centers to evaluate the individuals' acceptance of introducing Augmented Reality (AR) in the picking process to support pickers in their everyday tasks, gamification elements as a tool for increasing their motivation and last but not least, a combination of the two approaches.

AB  - In contemporary orbital missions, workloads are so high and varied that crew may rarely experience stretches of monotony. However, in historical long duration missions, occurrences of monotony were, indeed, reported anecdotally by crew. Of the effective countermeasures that appear to be at hand, many rely on visual or logistical proximity to the Earth, and are not feasible in the remote context of an extended deep space mission scenario. There, particularly in- and outbound cruising stages would be characterised by longer, comparably uneventful periods of low workload, coupled with confinement and unchanging vehicle surroundings. While the challenge of monotony has been pointed out as an exploration-related research area, it has received less explicit attention from a habitation design perspective than other human behaviour and performance issues. The paper addresses this gap through a literature review of the theory and application of design-based mitigation strategies. It outlines models of emergence of monotony, situates the phenomenon in a remote mission context as a problem of sensory, social and spatio-temporal isolation, and discusses proposed countermeasures related to habitability. The scope of the literature is extended to primary sources in the form of a qualitative review of six onboard diaries from orbital and simulator missions, highlighting a range of habitat-related design themes. These are translated into the autonomous deep space setting with the overall rationale of integrating affordances into onboard habitation systems and placing emphasis on reinforcing positive situational characteristics.

AB  - Automated decision aids can undoubtedly benefit system performance, but have the potential to provide incorrect advice, creating the possibility for automation disuse or misuse. This paper examined the extent to which increased automation transparency could improve the accuracy of automation use in a simulation of unmanned vehicle control. Participants were required to assign the best unmanned vehicle to complete missions. An automated recommender system provided advice but was not always reliable. Three levels of automation transparency were manipulated between-participants. Providing transparency regarding the reasoning underlying automated recommendations improved the accuracy of automation use, with no cost to decision time or subjective workload. Higher transparency in the form of projected decision outcome visualizations led to faster decisions, but less accurate automation use and an automation bias. Implications for the design of transparent interfaces to improve human-autonomy teaming outcomes in time-pressured environments are discussed.

AB  - In view of human factors, increased automation may result in deterioration of situation awareness, unbalanced workload and skill degradation as a cost of human increasingly being ‘out-of-the-loop’. The concept of dynamic function allocation (DFA) was suggested to resolve these disadvantages by changing the levels of human/machine's controls over system functions. Despite the importance of function allocation, there are limited methods explicitly working out the challenges of DFA in real-world applications. In order to improve system reliability and reduce ‘out-of-the-loop’ problems, the present study focuses on the determination of the reallocation times known as the trigger mechanism and the way of reallocating as the allocation strategy. To this end, the prediction of agent reliability is an essential step. To handle uncertainty arising from the subjectivity of analysis and lack of data, the Bayesian network is used to predict system performance. As a case study, the interaction of humans with a distributed control system used in a gas power plant is considered. By applying the proposed DFA method, human situation awareness and system reliability would be improved by approximately 30%, specifically under time pressure, and inappropriate work environment. This approach, as decision support, provides guidance for automation designers to improve an automated system.

AB  - This study focuses on noise evaluation and targeted noise reduction efforts. Goals of this study are to propose a noise annoyance evaluation (D) by developing the auditory saliency model. D replaces complex subjective measurements with concrete objective values. This noise evaluation method improves the accuracy of sound quality evaluation by avoiding the bias caused by different emphasis in traditional noise evaluation schemes and the huge workload caused by using questionnaires. Whether it is equipment operation noise or environmental noise, analyzing the noise frequency structure is an important part of achieving targeted noise reduction. Through the EA model (Early Acoustic Model), which is more suitable for the actual working conditions of the human ear, this study has combined with the energy algorithm to establish the noise annoyance factor (BP), which can accurately identify the main frequencies in the noise signal that affect the sound quality. Meanwhile, they also have a vital role in analyzing the frequency structure of the movement. This research verifies the accuracy of noise annoyance evaluation (D) by analyzing the simulation signal, vacuum cleaner working signal, and fan heat dissipation signal. The noise annoyance factor (BP) is used to locate the center frequency range of a group of acoustic signals that produce the most significant noise annoyance to achieve the purpose of targeted noise reduction. This study provided a new solution for sound quality evaluation and targeted noise reduction.

The results showed that CART models produced an acceptable error rate with high interpretability. These features may be used to understand and control the decision processes, instruct other human operators, compare margins of safety or modify them depending on the criticality of the industrial process. Compared with CART trees, random forests reduced the error rate at the cost of decreasing decision interpretability. The use of the agreement of the forest was proposed as a measure to reduce the workload of human operators, who would only have to focus on the analysis of ultrasonic oscillograms that are difficult to interpret.

AB  - In recent years, the combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has gained popularity in livestock management (LM) due to energy constraints and network instability. Limited energy storage of sensor nodes (SNs) and the possibility of packet loss contribute to fast energy consumption and unstable networks, respectively. UAVs serve as relay nodes and data sinks, addressing these issues by temporarily storing data to reduce SN workload and establishing mobile nodes for network stability. We propose two innovations based on previous work: 1) We introduce a multi-layer wireless network architecture, categorizing UAVs into two layers based on their functions including data collection and data processing. This enhances task parallelization, bridging performance gaps among multiple UAVs; 2) We overcome the mobility limitation of SNs, considering their real-time movement in the network. Through deep reinforcement learning, UAVs learn to cooperatively locate moving SNs. This accounts for the inevitable mobility of livestock in the industry. Additionally, we simulate the environment and compare our approach to traditional methods, evaluating metrics such as collected data per timestep (DCPS), energy consumed per timestep (ECPS), and network stability (NS). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches, achieving a data collecting gain of 4.84% and 8.20% compared to the methods without considering SN mobility or the multi-layer characteristics of WSNs, respectively. Under energy consumption limits, our method yields energy savings of 3.00% and 1.35% respectively. Furthermore, we extensively study and validate our method against other path planning algorithms, including genetic particle swarm optimization (GPSO), modified central force optimization (MCFO), and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT). Our approach surpasses these methods in terms of data collecting efficiency and network stability.

AB  - In many classification cases, the labeled samples are difficult to acquire. However, the unlabeled samples are easy to obtain. Active learning (AL) technology can be used to resolve the labeling problem. Among numerous kinds of AL algorithms, the one that focuses on labeling the unlabeled samples within the margin band of SVM is an effective way to decrease manual labeling workload. AL needs human involvement, but the time and energy which human can provide is often limited. Therefore, there is a big restriction for sample labeling based on the AL technology. To this end, the motivation of this work is to do studies on the processing after the AL process. For the AL algorithm which focuses on exploring the unlabeled samples within the margin band of SVM, after it stops, we aim for investigating whether such unlabeled samples can continue to be explored by semi-supervised learning (SSL) or not. To design such SSL algorithm, one of the challenges is how to figure out unlabeled samples’ confidence, and then select the ones with high confidence. In this work, we proposed 3 criterions to determine confidence, i.e. 1) the smoothness assumption; 2) the explored positive samples and the explored negative samples should be similar to the labeled positive samples and the labeled negative samples as much as possible, respectively; 3) the explored positive samples and the explored negative samples should be different from the labeled negative samples and the labeled positive samples as much as possible, respectively. Based on these 3 criterions, a SSL algorithm—SSL_3C was proposed in this work. Furthermore, we applied SSL_3C to audio event classification field, and did experiments on two public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SSL_3C can improve the classification performance after the AL process effectively. The selected unlabeled samples are not only of high confidence, but also very informative. Moreover, SSL_3C is not sensitive to the size of labeled and unlabeled training set. The contributions of this work lie in two aspects: first, for the unlabeled samples within the margin band of SVM, we have proposed an effective SSL algorithm to explore them; second, we innovatively proposed 3 criterions to determine unlabeled samples’ confidence. Based on these 3 criterions, the explored unlabeled samples are not only of high confidence, but also very informative. Since labeling problem exists in many classification fields, and SSL_3C can effectively decrease manual labeling workload, then the proposed SSL_3C should find widespread applications in many other fields.

AB  - Scalable link prediction in social networks allow dynamic social interaction gathering, potential friend suggestions, and community detection. Distributed open-source frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark facilitate efficient link prediction especially in large-scale social networks. The frameworks provide different kinds of tunable properties for users to manually configure the parameters for the applications. However, manual configurations are open to performance issues when the applications start scaling tremendously, which are hard to set up and are exposed to human errors. This paper proposes a novel Self-Configured Framework (SCF) to provide an autonomous feature in Spark that predicts and sets the best configuration instantly before the application execution using the XGBoost classifier. The framework with a self-configuration setting demonstrates a 40% reduction in prediction time as well as a balanced resource consumption that makes full use of resources, especially for limited number and size of clusters. The presented framework establishes its efficiency for link prediction in large-scale social networks by automatically configuring the best configuration suitable for a specific application given the varying dataset size of the Twitter social network, workload, and cluster specification.

AB  - Just-in-sequence material supply is the status quo in the automotive industry. In this process, the assembly sequence of vehicles is set several days prior to production, and communicated to the suppliers. The committed sequence is essential for efficient operations both at the original equipment manufacturer and its suppliers. In practice, however, sequence stability is insufficient. Short-term disruptions, such as quality problems and missing parts, put the sequence at risk. If a disruption occurs, the affected vehicle is removed from the sequence. The resulting gap is closed by bringing the succeeding vehicles forward. Such sequence alterations, however, cause workload changes and potentially work overloads at the assembly stations. As a remedial measure, additional sequence alterations are necessary, which further disturb material supply. Robustness against short-term sequence alterations is currently a key objective of automotive manufacturers. In this paper, we propose a sequencing approach that includes the vehicles’ failure probabilities in order to generate robust sequences. Robust sequences are sequences that can be operated without modifications, even when vehicles fail. We develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that optimally solves small-sized instances. For large-sized instances, we design a sampling-based adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic. The superiority of our approach is validated in a simulation study using real-world data from a major European manufacturer. We find reductions in the expected work overloads of 72% and 80%, compared to the industry solution, and compared to an approach taken from literature which does not take failures into account.

AB  - In this paper, we present hardware accelerators created with high-level synthesis techniques for sparse and dense matrix multiplication operations. The cores can operate with different precisions and are designed to be integrated in a heterogeneous CPU-FPGA system for Edge AI applications. The methodology involves quantization-sparsity aware training and it is applied to a case study consisting of human activity classification. We initially investigate the effects of quantization and sparsity on the accuracy of neural networks with convolution, dense and recurrent layers observing better tolerance to pruning when recurrent layers are present. Then, we propose the hardware accelerators that can switch precision at run-time and work with any matrix size up to a maximum configured at compile time. We compare the performance of these accelerators at different levels of precision and sparsity levels and create a performance model to enable workload balancing. The results show that the proposed sparse matrix multipliers can outperform dense multipliers when sparsity levels are higher than 70% and the improvements are more evident when higher precision arithmetic or structural pruning is used. Additionally, sparsity levels as high as 99% can maintain the level of accuracy required in the network especially when recurrent layers are deployed. Overall, the balance between sparse and dense performance depends on matrix shape, precision, structural pruning and sparsity levels and performance modelling can be used to balance concurrent execution in a heterogeneous configuration.

AB  - Background and Objective
Oral cancer is the sixth most common kind of human cancer. Brush cytology for counting Argyrophilic Nucleolar Organizer Regions (AgNORs) can help early mouth cancer detection, lowering patient mortality. However, the manual counting of AgNORs still in use today is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. The goal of our work is to address these shortcomings by proposing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to automatically segment individual nuclei and AgNORs in microscope slide images and count the number of AgNORs within each nucleus.
Methods
We systematically defined, trained and tested 102 CNNs in the search for a high-performing solution. This included the evaluation of 51 network architectures combining 17 encoders with 3 decoders and 2 loss functions. These CNNs were trained and evaluated on a new AgNOR-stained image dataset of epithelial cells from oral mucosa containing 1,171 images from 48 patients, with ground truth annotated by specialists. The annotations were greatly facilitated by a semi-automatic procedure developed in our project. Overlapping nuclei, which tend to hide AgNORs, thus affecting their true count, were discarded using an automatic solution also developed in our project. Besides the evaluation on the test dataset, the robustness of the best performing model was evaluated against the results produced by a group of human experts on a second dataset.
Results
The best performing CNN model on the test dataset consisted of a DenseNet-169 + LinkNet with Focal Loss (DenseNet-169 as encoder and LinkNet as decoder). It obtained a Dice score of 0.90 and intersection over union (IoU) of 0.84. The counting of nuclei and AgNORs achieved precision and recall of 0.94 and 0.90 for nuclei, and 0.82 and 0.74 for AgNORs, respectively. Our solution achieved a performance similar to human experts on a set of 291 images from 6 new patients, obtaining Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 for nuclei and 0.81 for AgNORs with 95% confidence intervals of [0.89, 0.93] and [0.77, 0.84], respectively, and p-values < 0.001, confirming its statistical significance. Our AgNOR-stained image dataset is the most diverse publicly available AgNOR-stained image dataset in terms of number of patients and the first for oral cells.
Conclusions
CNN-based joint segmentation and quantification of nuclei and NORs in AgNOR-stained images achieves expert-like performance levels, while being orders of magnitude faster than the later. Our solution demonstrated this by showing strong agreement with the results produced by a group of specialists, highlighting its potential to accelerate diagnostic workflows. Our trained model, code, and dataset are available and can stimulate new research in early oral cancer detection.

AB  - This paper formulates a non-linear integer programming model to solve a maintenance workforce sizing problem with a productivity improvement goal. This problem is modelled in a bi-objective framework that minimises the number of maintenance personnel while maximising their productivity levels. Inputs into the optimisation model include monthly and routine maintenance periods, volume of production, contingency maintenance time, use factor and priority factor among others. The model has been validated with real-life detergent factory data, demonstrating its potential usefulness. A principal novelty of the model is the inclusion of use factor, which captures how often maintenance technicians are busy on the job with respect to assigned tasks, including unanticipated high maintenance workload. The model has been solved using a branch and bound algorithm. The impact of workforce structure and workers’ salaries on model’s performance has been studied and sensitivity analysis carried out to investigate the changes to the optimal solution as a result of changes in the input data. The results show a reduction in the number of maintenance workforce personnel in comparing values with and without use factor in the model. The model’s ability to obtain global optimal result depends on the value of the minimum routine maintenance time within each maintenance section. Also, the model is shown to be sensitive to priority factor, which captures the appropriate ratio of full- and part-time workers under the same category. The model provides both an easy-to-use practical tool for maintenance managers and supervisors as well as a scientific tool for determining optimal maintenance workforce size for a manufacturing plant.

AB  - This paper presents a modelling design framework and results for human participants undergoing mental stress. A mental stressful scenario is achieved while participants perform operations in a simulated control process on an automation-enhanced Cabin Air Management System simulator. Recordings from a previous experiment using psychophysiological markers (Heart Rate Variability and Task Load Index) as inputs with an output performance marker (Time In Range) were used for offline modelling training and validation. Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic (IT2FL) architecture optimized with Genetic Algorithms and with an efficient type-reduction algorithm, was selected as the modelling technique. Results demonstrate the ability of IT2FL systems to cope with an additional level of uncertainty and to adapt to important input-output relation changes on validation of the model. These results surpass performance in validation of a type 1 Mamdani Fuzzy Logic system constructed and validated previously in a similar fashion. The constructed model provides an adequate framework that can be used for the prevention of operator breakdown.

AB  - Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of irreversible blindness. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment and prevention of vision loss. Recently, tele-ophthalmology has gained more acceptance for remote consulting, and eye screening. The tele-ocular screening can be enhanced further with emerging technologies in robotic process automation (RPA) that offers the ability to automate repetitive human tasks of the ocular screening process. This work aims to assess time effectiveness of the RPA-supported glaucoma screening. Mobile-based glaucoma screening combining RPA and machine learning (ML) is developed for assessing its usability and the time effectiveness of the RPA-supported glaucoma screening. The usability evaluation of the developed application is conducted with 68 participants including both patients and medical staff. Handling times that users spent with or without RPA support are recorded along with the satisfactory questionnaire surveys. The results show that the screening system with integration of RPA reduces the average handling time per user by 75%. The overall satisfaction score of the application is 8.10 out of 10. The machine learning module helps in notifying clinicians when the preliminary diagnosis results in severe conditions, allowing timely treatment. Integration of RPA and ML can assist clinicians and reduce the workload of medical staff significantly. Our study shows that the RPA and ML-based framework improves customer experiences and cost-time efficiency. It promotes feasibility in large-scale population glaucoma screening and data collection.

AB  - In Human-Machine (HM) systems, human operators and machines cooperate to achieve a system goal. Accordingly, the operators' task load should be dynamically adjusted in accordance with their physiological and psychological status, so-called operator functional state (OFS). In this sense, the HM system behavior becomes hybrid. Petri net and its extensions have been widely used in hybrid system modeling and control. In this paper, we use a fuzzy inference Petri net to model the HM system and then realize adaptive task allocation between human operator and machine. The model can predict the “performance” of the operator, based on which the workload can be reallocated (i.e., increased or reduced somehow) between the operator and machine in an adaptive fashion the tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the approach of fuzzy inference Petri nets proposed is an effective way in modeling and control of HM hybrid systems.

AB  - As technology becomes more sophisticated, autonomous agents are applied more frequently to improve system performance. The current research employed a five step method, including modeling, simulation, and human experimentation to explore the effect of an artificial agent’s timing on the performance of a human-agent team within a highly dynamic task environment. Agent timing significantly influenced the role assumed by the human within the team. Further, agent timing changed system performance by approximately 40% within the experimental conditions. Results indicate that an artificial agent’s timing can be varied as a function of the task demands placed upon the human-agent team to maintain an appropriate level of human activity and engagement. Therefore, agent timing may be controlled to adapt autonomy to provide an apparent continuum along which to control human engagement in systems employing human-agent teaming within dynamic environments.

AB  - Power consumption is becoming complicated to tackle each day in the embedded systems industry. As the demand for speed and accuracy increases, so does the power consumption of these systems. While introduction of multiprocessors have been shown to reduce the power problem compared to a uni-processor, researchers have tried to attain results using methods such as voltage and frequency scaling and scheduling methods. As an extension of these methods, task migration can be used to further reduce the power consumption of multiprocessor architectures. This article introduces a three-part framework to energy reduction of applications on a multiprocessor through an effective task allocation technique followed by task migration and finally a proper task scheduling scheme based on the earliest deadline first (EDF) method. Our experimental results showed great improvement over multiple state of the art energy reduction methods in the literature especially in the case of higher system workload over a range of underlying system architectures.

AB  - With the increasing demand of designing a reliable processing devices, the issue of CMOS ageing is jeopardising the industry of digital devices. Many studies has been cover this area for modelling the ageing behaviour at the device level or developing ageing sensors for on-line delay detection at the system level. However, we are presenting a method to estimate the ageing stresses (e.g. Temperature, Ageing Stress Activity) rather than the modelling ageing (performance degradation) itself. The purpose for estimating the ageing stress is to optimise the system utilisation with the minimisation of ageing stress. In multicore processors, the existence of more than one source of ageing stress is higher than single core processor but the optimisation space is higher as well along with the temperature and power optimisation. In this paper, we have modelled the ageing stress from the application level using machine learning techniques to train data extracted from high level workloads ( e.g. parsec and splash2 benchmarks) on four cores processor from Xeon. The ageing stress model is able to estimate the ageing stress with 0.1% error and is able to proactively reduce the ageing stress by 50%.

AB  - In view of various objectives and complex constraints in ship pipe route design (SPRD), the previous studies often convert the problem into a single objective optimization consisting of several weighted routing objectives, which cannot generate rich references for designers. In addition, the current CAD systems only provide an environment for manual design and simple automatic route design, resulting in low work performance and a huge workload. Therefore, this paper presents a new ship pipe route design method based on multi-objective ant colony optimization (MOACO). Firstly, the mathematical model and multi-objective definition of SPRD are formulated, and then the key technologies of the modified algorithm are introduced in detail, e.g., ant moving direction, heuristic information, pheromone update rules, tabu search and step backward strategy et al. On this basis, the MOACO framework and its internal ant routing process are presented. To route multiple pipes and branched pipes, a combination method based on Pareto solutions and human choice is given. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by the simulation and actual routing cases.

AB  - In a highly technology-dependent society, processing large amounts of data has become essential, resulting in a growing number of data centers. The global data center industry accounts for a significant proportion of the world’s energy consumption. A partial or total transition of the energy sources that power the operation of data centers to cleaner energy, particularly onsite renewable technologies, will help to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals established in international agreements. However, integrating such technologies is difficult due to the intermittency and availability of renewable sources. Nevertheless, temporal and geographical flexibility for processing part of the data centers’ workload provides an opportunity to efficiently integrate these renewable energy sources. In this paper, we develop an operational scheme for a network of interconnected data centers with a significant electricity supply from onsite technologies consisting of (i) an optimal job migration and scheduling policy for data centers to match their operation and the availability of renewable energy under an emissions cap-and-trade program; (ii) an energy management system to control the data centers’ onsite renewable and grid energy resources; and (iii) a robust optimization approach to account for the intermittency of the renewables and to identify the optimal migration and scheduling policies under the worst-case scenario. A case study is carried out to assess the economic and environmental impacts. The results indicate that the installation of onsite technologies and an optimal migration policy reduce the operational costs and the greenhouse gas emissions of the networks of data centers.

AB  - There is a wide recognition that Blockchain technology will play a central role in many sectors. In fact, this technology is a promising opportunity to ensure security, traceability, privacy and transparency in most digitized human activities. The supply chain of hazardous materials is a typical sensitive industrial activity that requires a high level of vigilance. The various stakeholders of such supply chain need to share crucial data using high secure channels while ensuring traceability. However, Blockchain is currently an energy-intensive technology. In this context, the challenge is to minimize the risk related to the hazardous materials supply chain using an eco-friendly and cost effective Blockchain. In this paper, we propose a green-Blockchain based framework for the hazardous materials supply chain. Two mathematical models are proposed for the energy management consumed by Blockchain transactions. The first one minimizes the total consumed energy by a set of servers by providing the optimal assignment of computing tasks over the time periods, while the second one minimizes both the CO2 emissions and the cost of a grid energy mix. To prove the applicability of the proposed framework, a Blockchain prototype is implemented to simulate an IoT-based supply chain of hazardous materials. The results show that the proposed system may help to ensure the security of dangerous goods transportation. Furthermore, the energy management using optimization modeling would provide CO2 emissions reduction and thus ensure sustainability of Blockchain transactions.

As various human actions are involved in the operation of NPPs, there is a need to screen human actions first and, then, focus the analysis on the critical ones. In the past, different NPPs have adopted different standards in screening human actions and many of these standards lack theoretical support. In this study, the concept of human action risk achievement worth (HRAW) is introduced to support probabilistic screening. A new probabilistic method for screening safety-related human actions in NPPs is proposed. The results of a case study indicate that the proposed method performs well and better than the previous probabilistic screening method typically used, it also implies that this method can provides methodological support to the probabilistic screening method of human actions. On the one hand, utilizing this method to screen human actions can help identifying those actions that are critical for the safety of NPPs. On the other hand, it can reduce the workload and improve work efficiency. The method is traceable and easy to use. It not only can be used in the design of NPPs, but also can provide guidelines for reviewers to evaluate the NPPs safety.

AB  - Many researchers of human engineering seek to enhance work efficiency and to reduce workloads by analyzing worker load, work efficiency, and production using analogue methods, such as checklists. Recent analyses have examined job performance using digital human models created by digitally recording the movements of actual workers through keyboard and mouse-based data input. However, this modeling method has two problems: it takes too much time to model all movements, and accuracy depends on the modeling technician. To solve these problems, this study presents a digital human modeling automation system using Kinect, a Microsoft Xbox data input device, to model human movements. The system is designed to utilize multiple Kinects, and the data model conveys and manages data from these devices to calibrate an algorithm that can be used to create a digital human model. Through this system, it is possible to easily generate a digital human model accurately, inexpensively, and efficiently. The developed digital human modeling automation system is verified using four scenarios, and the results, limitations, and development plan of the study are described.

AB  - In a schedule based Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, minor disruptions to the traffic flow could have a wider impact than would be expected as aircraft are linked temporally. However, given the frequency of these minor disruptions, the extent of their impact on operations needs to be scoped. In a human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation, four TRACON controllers worked arrival traffic to Phoenix airport (PHX), aided by a schedule and controller sequencing and spacing tools. In approximately two-thirds of the runs, either one or two disrupting events that were local or global in nature, were set in motion. Controllers were asked to manage the disruptions and bring the traffic back onto the schedule. The research questions were exploratory: to observe the impact of the disruption, watch how controllers solved these problems and whether the controller tools assisted them. Global events were observed to have a greater impact on TRACON operations than local events as they led to a greater mean path length flown by aircraft through the TRACON and, although reported workload levels remained manageable overall global events created higher reported loads. Controller strategies for resolving events followed a similar pattern: with controllers often solving local problems with speed and moving to using vectors more often during global events. Controllers used their tools in a similar manner to those observed in nominal-operations studies, with the slot marker being the preferred aid regardless of the event. However, due to the range of factors influencing the event, e.g., environmental conditions, aircraft density in the TRACON, etc., sometimes the plan required revision and occasionally events had a wide-reaching effect.

AB  - The design and development of software agents that perform adjustable autonomous actions in dynamic environments is a challenging research issue. Adjustable autonomous agents operate according to a spectrum of autonomy states. The autonomy states are dynamically adjusted to improve the agents’ performance and avoid autonomy surprises. For instance, the agents need to be guided or improvise when they encounter unplanned events. In this paper, we propose an Adjustable Autonomy Management (AAM) module for multi-agent systems. We integrate the AAM module within a BDI agent’s architecture to form an adjustable autonomous agent. The AAM module enables the agent to internally adjust its autonomy and handles external autonomy adjustments. We apply the agents in an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system. We test the UAV in a dynamic environment via experimenting aerial surveillance missions. The test results show that the agent-based UAV system successfully operates in the dynamic environment and performs the aerial surveillance missions. Subsequently, the AAM module is able to manage agents’ autonomy, reduce human workload and reduce adjustable autonomy disturbance.

AB  - Monitoring the degradation of induction motors is an essential concern for industries, especially when there are high costs related to maintenance and their stops. Nowadays, there are many non-invasive ways to monitor the health status of induction motors, including sensors to measure temperature, magnetic field, vibration, current, and power. However, installing these sensors may not be a simple task since intrusive procedures such as engine disassembling, wire separation, and engine interruption are commonly observed. Thus, we propose MUCLA (Multiphase Clamp and Tracking - patent pending) as a new device and methodology for monitoring motor degradation by analyzing its stator current. MUCLA introduces a non-invasive current sensors array on a proposed clamp in the hardware perspective, while a spectral tracking methodology refers to our novelty in the software viewpoint. For end-users, the main MUCLA contribution relies on the combination of the simplicity of installation and the possibility of using the proposed device even when considering Variable-Frequency Drive powered engines. The results obtained with both simulation and practical tests show encouraging results over different input workloads and emulated degradation. Compared to the current initiatives, we can classify MUCLA as a better solution for industrial plants in terms of installation time, installation complexity, and cost.

AB  - Tubes and catheters are medical devices introduced into the human body to help ill patients in critical health conditions. However, several positioning errors occur during or after the placement of such devices (Endotracheal tubes mispositioned in 10 to 20% of intubations). In addition, the delay of X-ray diagnosis after surgery can cause serious complications. Such delays are caused by the hospitals' resourcelessness or due to workload in intensive care units. The X-rays images availability (Most used diagnosis modality in intensive care units, 40% to 50%) and the presence of tubes in those images (lines are present on 33% of X-ray images) present a fertile ground to feed DCNNs training on tube error detection tasks and reduce complications. However, training and tuning one DCNN learner to resolve tube detection is time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a custom stacked generalization framework to combine wake learners with a proposed meta learner neural network architecture to resolve tube error detection tasks. The proposed framework AUC (93.84%) outperforms other related work methods with the input size of (380pixel*380pixel). Furthermore, we demonstrated the sensibility of stacked generalization to the number of base learners. Moreover, we validated the utility of input cross-validation used to form level1-metadata for the stacked generalization. Our framework can be adapted to be integrated with a CAD (computer aid decision system) for tubes error detection. The CAD can detect errors immediately after patient screening and notify radiologists to prioritize diagnosis of cases with positioning errors to adjust tubes and reduce risks significantly.

AB  - Mitigating human errors is a priority in the designs of complex systems, especially through the use of body area networks. This paper describes early developments of a dynamic data driven platform to predict operator error and trigger appropriate intervention before the error happens. Using a two-stage process, data was collected using several sensors (e.g., electroencephalography, pupil dilation measures, and skin conductance) during an established protocol - the Stroop test. The experimental design began with a relaxation period, 40 questions (congruent, then incongruent) without a timer, a rest period followed by another two rounds of questions, but under increased time pressure. Measures such as workload and engagement showed responses consistent with what is expected for Stroop tests. Dynamic system analysis methods were then used to analyze the raw data using principal components analysis and the least squares complex exponential method. The results show that the algorithms have the potential to capture mental states in a mathematical fashion, thus enabling the possibility of prediction.

In addition, the UsabilityAdviser tool can be used to check the UI description against a set of usability rules. This approach fits well into the human performance and error analysis proposed in the European project HUMAN, where virtual testers (CASCaS) are used to evaluate assistant systems and their HMI. A first step for realizing this approach has been made by implementing a 3D rendering engine for UsiXML.

AB  - Network centrality is an intermediary between airport resource utilization and air traffic generation. A central position in the network with frequent and regular flights with hub nodes can boost air traffic by providing better accessibility, resulting in more efficient use of airport resources. However, this relationship has been largely ignored in the literature. Using data from the Turkish airport industry, this paper proposed a weight-restricted Network Data Envelopment Analysis model, which considers network centrality measures as the cornerstone intermediates that establish the link between airport resources and the traffic volume handled. In the first stage, called networkability, assets such as runways, terminals, aprons, and special purpose vehicles, and exogenous factors including population, socio-economic development, and tourist arrivals are used to accomplish the network integration with other airports, as measured by degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. In the second stage, called traffic generation, this network integration allows for aircraft movements and workload unit to be handled. Criteria weights of model variables were calculated using Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation. The main findings indicate that 1) the weight-restriction procedure improved the robustness of Network DEA, 2) the proposed two-stage structure reveals whether performance losses are due to networkability or traffic generation capabilities and helps to identify the right policies for performance improvement, 3) the Turkish airports generally suffer from the inability to establish connections in the domestic network, 4) the pandemic has significantly improved the domestic networkability of airports due to mandatory direct flights while devastating the traffic generation capability, 5) low betweenness centrality is the main reason for weak networkability, and 6) good networkability may not ensure air traffic generation.

AB  - An innovative force measuring system for the hinged door with and without a door closer was developed in this study. A self-designed quarter-arc guiding track device was especially applied in this system, and thus both the door operating force as well as the door operating torque was simultaneously and effectively measured. Then, a series of experiments in the laboratory were carried out to determine the door required operating torque (ROT). The results showed that as the door closer was utilized, the ROT of the door increased significantly. There were two characteristic measuring signals, the initial operating torque (IOT) and the ROT existed individually. The difference of these two toques became greater as a lower door opening speed and a bigger size of door closer was applied. The results showed that the application of the door closer would increase users' workload so as to make the door operate intermittently especially for people with poor individual capability. Thus, suggestions of the application of a door closer were further given in accomplishing a door with universal design.
Relevance to industry
An appropriate operating force measuring system and methods for the hinged door were provided here. According to the measuring signals, the workload burden level of the door operation could be effectively evaluated. Moreover, the door opening capability (DOC) score defined by the ratio of the ROT to the door-opened time was proved to be effectively utilized as the indicator of the required individual capability for users.

KW  - Device-to-device offloading

KW  - Social relationship
AB  - Mobile cloud computing has been widely used to support the computation-intensive applications in mobile devices. Since cloud computing relies on the facilities like network infrastructures and cloud servers, the cloud service can be easily hampered by the limitation of these facilities in many cases. Therefore, researchers proposed the concept of device-to-device offloading to offload workload to nearby devices, without going through other facilities. Most existing works on device-to-device offloading aim to minimize the execution time of tasks or minimize the energy consumption. These works assume devices can be connected for a long time, but they neglect the fact that the connections among mobile devices are usually intermittent and even opportunistic, which may render the failure of task offloading. In this paper, we propose a new approach, PeerCloud, that aims to improve the success ratio of task offloading. Specifically, since mobile devices are carried by human beings, we study the social relationship between the device carriers and discover the hidden regularity in their contact patterns, in order to predict the likelihood of node departure. Optimization problems are then formalized to maximize the success ratio of task offloading within tasks’ time constraints. Experimental results based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PeerCloud outperforms existing approaches by significantly improving the success ratio.

AB  - Purpose:
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought tremendous changes and challenges to male and female employees. The idea of work-life balance means, that a human’s life outside of the job is equally important to their work life and that the amount of time spent working should be evenly divided by the amount of time spent doing things, such as occupied hours with friends and family, exercising, and other similar ventures. Amongst other challenges, attaining satisfaction and balance is a key challenge. Aim: The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of men's and women's work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the theoretical framework of which is the work-life balance theory, which asserts that individuals should have an equitable distribution of time and energy between their work and personal life domains. The theory emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance to promote overall well-being and satisfaction
Methodology:
The current study is descriptive, empirical, and quantitative. The data were collected through a questionnaire administered to 200 working men and women employees. The latest PLS method was also used to analyse the obtained data.
Results:
The findings reveal that women experience more workload than men because of their personal involvement in their jobs through the period of working from home. Notably, there were no gender variances in the connection between work interruptions and personal life. It was found that the organization could help to reduce work interference with personal life and that by doing so, employees’ work-life unevenness could be reduced to some level.
Practical and Social Implication:
Given the possibility of employees experiencing psychological stress, a company could consider arranging for a trained professional to provide online counselling. Such a strategic initiative by a company during stressful times could motivate employees. The environment may also aid employees in maintaining their psychological welfare
Conclusion:
Many prior studies have examined the nature of WLB and the psychological and behavioural disorders that employees face. This study aimed to investigate the work-life balance in which employees were mandated to work from home during the -19 pandemic.

AB  - In an automated car, users can fully engage in a distractor task, making it a primary task. Compared to manual driving, drivers can engage in tasks that are difficult to interrupt and of higher demand, the consequences can be a reduced perception of, and an impaired reaction to, warnings. In this study we compared three in-vehicle warnings (auditory, tactile, and auditory-tactile) which were presented during three highly attention capturing tasks (visual, auditory, and tactile) while the user was engaged in a self-driving car scenario, culminating in an emergency brake event where the warning was presented. The novel addition for this paper was that three set paced, attention capturing tasks, as well the three warnings were all designed in a pilot study to have comparable workload and noticeability. This enabled a direct comparison of human performance to be made between each of the attention capturing tasks, which are designed to occupy only one specific modality (auditory, visual or haptic), but remain similar in overall task demand. Results from the study showed reaction times to the tactile warning (for the emergency braking event) were significantly slower compared to the auditory and auditory-tactile (aka multimodal or multisensory) warning. Despite the similar reaction times between the in-vehicle auditory warning and the multimodal warning, the multimodal warning led to a reduced number of missed warnings and fewer false responses. However, the auditory and auditory-tactile warnings were rated significantly more startling than the tactile alone. Our results extend the literature regarding the performance benefits of multimodal warnings by comparing them with in-vehicle auditory warnings in an autonomous driving context. The set-pace attention capturing tasks in this study would be of interest to other researchers to evaluate the interaction in an automated driving context, particularly with hard to interrupt and attention capturing tasks.

AB  - Background
Gaps in information access impede immunization uptake, especially in low-resource settings where cutting-edge and innovative digital interventions are limited given the digital inequity. Our objective was to develop an Artificially Intelligent (AI) chatbot to respond to caregiver’s immunization-related queries in Pakistan and investigate its feasibility and acceptability in a low-resource, low-literacy setting.
Methods
We developed Bablibot (Babybot), a local language immunization chatbot, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies with Human in the Loop feature. We evaluated the bot through a sequential mixed-methods study. We enrolled caregivers visiting the 12 selected immunization centers for routine childhood vaccines. Additional caregivers were reached through targeted text message communication. We assessed Bablibot’s feasibility and acceptability by tracking user engagement and technological metrics, and through thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with 20 caregivers.
Findings
Between March 9, 2020, and April 15, 2021, 2,202 caregivers were enrolled in the study, of which, 677 (30.7%) interacted with Bablibot (users). Bablibot responded to 1,877 messages through 874 conversations. Conversation topics included vaccination due dates (32.4%; 283/874), side-effect management (15.7%;137/874), or delaying vaccination due to child’s illness or COVID-lockdown (16.8%;147/874). Over 90% (277/307) of responses to text-based exit surveys indicated satisfaction with Bablibot. Qualitative analysis showed caregivers appreciated Bablibot’s usefulness and provided feedback for further improvement of the system.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of local-language NLP chatbots in providing real-time immunization information in low-resource settings. Text-based chatbots canminimize the workload on helpline operators, in addition to instantaneously resolving caregiver queries that otherwise lead to delay or default.

AB  - The most effective technique for improving students writing skills is for them to get immediate instructor’s feedback and as often as possible. This, however, significantly expands the workload of the instructors. There is a growing need for automated systems to help students draft essays. Automated essay evaluation is increasingly popular in the field of educational evaluation technology. In this work, we present an automatic evaluator of student essays in Arabic language, a system that is modeled on the scheme followed by the school-teachers in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The main criteria for assessing the essays is: language proficiency; the structure of the essay; and the content which should match the topic. With this in mind, we developed a scheme that relies on latent semantic analysis, and rhetorical structure theory. The system was tested on over 300 different essays, all handwritten by schoolchildren covering various subjects. The performance was measured by machine-human correlation in grading. Our system achieved an overall correlation of 0.79 with the teachers’ evaluation.

AB  - Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a procedure used to treat patients with large or irregularly shaped kidney stones. Surgical instruments are inserted through a small incision to access the kidney and remove the calculi. Surgeons who have less experience with the procedure manifest significantly higher rates of complications due to the procedure’s steep learning curve. This issue is further exacerbated by a lack of training opportunities in clinical settings. This paper introduces a teleoperative framework that can provide training to surgeons as well as assistance during procedures, based on two main components. Firstly, a type of constrained inverse kinematics that decouples the tooltip position from its orientation using a remote centre of motion, and incorporates the joint limits analytically. This reduces the workload of the procedure by having the surgeon control only the tooltip position rather than the position and the orientation while preventing the inverse kinematics from returning joint angles outside of the robot’s abilities. This kinematic framework also allows a three-degrees-of-freedom haptic device to control a six-degrees-of-freedom manipulator. Secondly, haptic feedback is provided to help guide and teach the surgeon during the procedure. Haptic feedback allows the surgeon to remain in full control during the procedure while still receiving haptic cues and assistance. Experimental results indicate that the haptic cues improved user’s accuracy, and they had shorter and smoother paths. This leads to a shorter procedure time overall. The results also indicate that the haptic assistance helped teach users the ideal trajectory of the procedure and that users who were taught with haptic feedback performed better than those who never experienced any haptic feedback.

AB  - Automated aids are engineered to support operators’ decision-making in complex and task-saturated environments, alerting them of system status and critical incidents. However, even the most advanced technologies are susceptible to failure. Monitoring imperfect automated systems poses unique challenges related to operator attention and workload. This study empirically examined the effect of unreliable automation on monitoring performance and responses to auditory stimuli in a multi-tasking environment. Participants completed an experimental trial consisting of four flight-related tasks while monitoring for automation failures at one of three levels of automation reliability. Participants in a high reliability condition responded more quickly and frequently to auditory messages. No performance differences were found in system monitoring performance between reliability conditions. These results are relevant to the design of automated system and delivery of automated alerts, and they have implications for operator attention allocation strategies in multi-tasking environments.

AB  - Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are effective measures for reducing the risk of traffic accidents. This paper provides evaluation results for ADAS using the mutual assistance paradigm, in which drivers mutually assist each other for automobile safety. The goal of the mutual assistance system is not only to reduce the risk of traffic accidents but also to improve the driver’s attitude. In this research, evaluation of an assistance system was performed with a driving simulator. The experimental results revealed that the automation level of the mutual assistance system heavily changed the driver's attitude. The semi-automatic system was more effective than the fully automatic system for making positive attitude changes. In addition, the semi-automatic system was the most effective for decreasing the driver collision rate. Therefore, the semi-automatic system with some voluntary actions was most suitable for the mutual assistance system and can possibly restrain risk compensation behavior.

AB  - This paper develops a scalable method for the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) with a type-2 fuzzy uncertain activity time-span. The objective of this method is the project completion time minimization. This problem has been solved through a scalable type-2 fuzzy Dijkstra algorithm inside different activities rules. The Dijkstra algorithm produces a different permutation of activities alongside each selected path that should be examined in optimization function using the type-2 fuzzy simplex algorithm. This method generates the best permutation using run-time optimization which significantly satisfies lower project completion time inside the project cost minimization. Also, the method proposed a resource workload for both tactical and operational levels of planning. The presented approach is conducted by the gas-related industry project and a case on satellite design of the aerospace industry on 3 different Resource/Process/Environment strategies. The results convey the defined method has a better performance compared to type-1 fuzzy for covering the largest uncertainty domain. This method could be considered in every engineering project management.

AB  - The explosive growth of time series captured by sensors in industrial pipelines gives rise to the flourish of intelligent industry. Exploiting the value of these time series is conductive to workload balancing and production optimization. Unfortunately, knowledge obtained from the mining process turns out to be insufficient for use due to widespread anomalies, indicating machine breakdown, sensor failure or working status shifts. To tackle this problem, we propose a constraint hypergraph-based method, combining multiple constraints for anomaly detection. We develop strategies for adaptive determinative anomaly detection and anomaly pattern mining. We also investigate the problem of Anomaly Pattern Matching, prove its NP-completeness, and propose algorithms to obtain its global and local optimum. Finally, we demonstrate our approach with three real world datasets from a real powerplant, a chemical production pipeline and a hydraulic system. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively and efficiently work under different circumstances.

AB  - Communication breakdowns in the referral process negatively impact clinical workflow and patient safety. There is a lack of evidence demonstrating the impact of published design recommendations addressing contributing issues with consultation order templates. This study translated the recommendations into a computer-based prototype and conducted a comparative usability evaluation. With a scenario-based simulation, 30 clinicians (referrers) participated in a within-group, counterbalanced experiment comparing the prototype with their present electronic order entry system. The prototype significantly increased satisfaction (Cohen's d = 1.80, 95% CI [1.19, 2.41], p < .001), and required significantly less mental effort (d = 0.67 [0.14, 1.20], p < .001). Regarding efficiency, the prototype required significantly fewer mouse clicks (mean difference = 29 clicks, p < .001). Although overall task time did not differ significantly (d = −0.05 [−0.56, 0.47]), the prototype significantly quickened identification of the appropriate specialty clinic (mean difference = 12 s, d = 0.98 [0.43, 1.52], p < .001). The experimental evidence demonstrated that clinician-centered interfaces significantly improved system usability during ordering of consultations.

AB  - The paper presents ergonomic assessment of the “tram drivers - tram - traffic environment” system in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. The input data were collected by surveying the subjective disturbances from cognitive perception of 36 female respondents working as tram drivers. System of many simultaneous different ergo-assessment factors that affect female drivers while operating the tram may cause reduction of reliability and safety of the tram drivers’ actions and increase the workload during the driving. The ergonomic assessment of subjective disturbance factors was realized by means of concrete parameters with numerical values, on the basis of which the dominant and important factors of disturbance per percentage were divided into three standard groups of factors: human factor, traffic means and traffic environment. Increased share of disturbance factors from the groups traffic means and traffic environment in relation to the share of human factor proves intense impact of traffic means and traffic environment on the female tram drivers.

The researcher emphasised with current research the need for an induction programme for beginning teachers in the South African context to overcome the challenges experienced by beginning teachers while bridging from pre-service teaching to in-service teaching and to introduce and illuminate the design of a new multimodal induction model.
Design/methodology/approach
The researcher followed a narrative approach by discussing previous research regarding the insufficient pre-service training beginning teachers received and the lack of a structured induction programme in the South African context.
Findings
Research has shown that South African beginning teachers have faced similar difficulties as beginning teachers worldwide, but South African beginning teachers are not subjected to formal induction programmes. While the South African Department of Basic Education offered guidelines for the beginning teacher orientation programme, there is almost no evidence in the literature that schools follow such guidelines.
Research limitations/implications
The implications of this paper give other researchers in this field a broader perspective on how the new multimodal induction model can make a measurable contribution to the school, the mentor, the beginning teacher and, most importantly, the learner.
Practical implications
The Department of Basic Education in South Africa and Principals need to follow the guidelines of this multimodal induction model to retain beginning teachers and improve the performance of learners.
Originality/value
This is a new model developed by the researcher to explore the benefits of promoting excellence in the teaching profession through a technology-rich, integrated induction programme to increase the productivity, retention and leadership of beginning teachers, enhance and prevent the loss of human capital, with the ultimate goal of improving learners' growth and performance.

AB  - In recent years, the industry of wearable devices for pregnancies has been developing rapidly. The devices ranges from foetal monitors to multi-functional health examination instruments, which helped monitoring and management of maternal health indicators such as foetal heart rate, blood glucose, and blood pressure in home. Pregnant women and obstetricians are bounded together by wearable devices in an unprecedented way. With the universal use of the Internet of Things technology, the Smart Maternal construction started to raise people’s attention. This article proposes an Internet of Things platform for smart maternal healthcare services with wearable devices and cloud computing and the key technologies. We also investigate its applications, and monitoring and management modes in home for obstetrics departments in hospitals. The Smart Maternal platform, which is based on the Internet of Things and centres on pregnant women, is able to greatly mitigate the workload of medical staffs, increase the work efficiency, facilitate the pregnant women to go to the doctors and improve the quality of obstetrical treatment.

AB  - Co-location attacks jeopardize data privacy and performance of virtual machines (VMs) in cloud computing, which can result in unexpected monetary losses that are not supported or covered by the investments made by users and providers. The uncertainty about the VM type (attacker, target or neutral) exacerbates the difficulty of the problem. However, existing methods, particularly VM placement strategies, fail to capture the risk of significant losses. The measures of risk have a crucial role in coping with the losses that might be incurred by the involved parties in finance or the insurance industry. In this paper, we introduce the notion of risk to the co-location resistant VM placement strategies. We develop a novel framework that assesses the co-location attack risk of an assignment returned by a specific VM placement strategy. A thorough analysis of multiple existing VM placement algorithms highlights the significance of incorporating this measure as it reveals a discernible correlation pattern with respect to co-location attack coverage and resource consumption. Based on these findings, we propose a new Approximate Co-Location Resistant Placement Strategy with Risk Constraints (ACLRPS-RC) to protect the involved parties from overwhelming security losses. The simulations on CloudSim using real workloads show the ability of the new strategy to meet a given level of risk while maintaining an adequate number of used servers.

AB  - Introduction
Trait authenticity has been defined as a dispositional individual difference, and it refers to people's experience of living in accordance with their true Self. Despite research conducted in working contexts has found that trait authenticity is related to people's work engagement, it is not clear if this association may be mediated by other variables.
Objective
Framing trait authenticity within the job demands-resources model, we hypothesized that trait authenticity allows the release of human full potential in terms of personal resources that, in turn, promote work engagement, especially in highly challenging work settings, such as educational ones.
Method
We administered a self-report questionnaire composed of several measurement scales to 446 teachers working in kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools.
Results and conclusions
A moderated mediation analysis revealed that trait authenticity can promote teachers’ emergence of personal resources, which in turn enhances their work engagement. The study highlights that the role of trait authenticity and personal resources on work engagement acquires a particular salience when teachers face high (vs. low) challenge job demands (i.e., workload), that is when this reservoir of potential is needed the most.
Résumé
Introduction
L’authenticité de trait a été définie comme une différence individuelle dispositionnelle. Elle se réfère à l’expérience de vivre en accord avec le vrai Soi. Bien que les recherches aient montré que, dans les contextes de travail, l’authenticité des traits est liée à l’engagement des personnes au travail, mais il n’est pas clair si cette association peut être médiée par d’autres variables.
Objectif
En encadrant l’authenticité des traits de caractère dans le modèle exigences professionnelles-ressources, nous avons émis l’hypothèse que l’authenticité des traits de caractère permet la libération du plein potentiel humain en termes de ressources personnelles qui, à leur tour, favorisent l’engagement au travail, en particulier dans les environnements de travail très exigeants, tels que les environnements éducatifs.
Méthodologie
Les variables de l’étude ont été mesurées en administrant un questionnaire d’auto-évaluation à 446 enseignants de la maternelle, du primaire et du collège.
Résultats et conclusions
Une analyse de médiation modérée a révélé que l’authenticité de trait peut favoriser l’émergence de ressources personnelles chez les enseignants, et que les ressources personnelles peuvent favoriser l’engagement au travail. L’étude souligne que le rôle de l’authenticité de trait et des ressources personnelles sur l’engagement au travail acquiert une importance particulière lorsque les enseignants sont confrontés à des demandes professionnelles élevées, c’est à ce moment-là que ce réservoir de potentiel est le plus nécessaire.

AB  - Industrial vehicles’ activities are rather heterogeneous and depend on vehicle’s type, model, and context of usage. Vehicles’ workload is usually summarized by means of standard labels, called duties. Fleet managers exploit duties to optimize productivity, minimize costs, show compliance with industrial regulations, and prevent vehicle misuses and failures. Duty levels are commonly manually enforced by manufacturers separately for each vehicle. However, since vehicles’ usage levels may fluctuate from light to heavy with variable periodicity, duty level assignment requires periodic customization. This paper addresses the problem of automatically defining the current duties of industrial vehicles and their corresponding levels by means of machine learning techniques applied to CAN bus data. In the context of industrial vehicle management, a key challenge is the lack of annotated data due to the following reasons: (1) The high variability in vehicles’ models and types makes the annotation process extremely labor-intensive. (2) Duty levels depend on the current usage context thus requiring periodic refinements. To tackle these issues, we propose a new two-stage method based on segment-wise clustering of per-vehicle CAN bus signals followed by a point-wise duty level assignment applied to the samples of each segment. Segments of per-vehicle CAN bus signals are first grouped together to discover similar vehicle usage profiles. Then, separately for each group we automatically derive the point-wise duty levels characterizing each usage profile. The proposed methodology is unsupervised, i.e., it does not require the availability of any annotated data, and is portable to arbitrary vehicles and context of usage without the need of human intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on CAN bus data acquired from real vehicles of different types and models. The empirical evidence confirms its applicability to real industrial scenarios.

AB  - Age-related remodelling of the arterial wall shifts the load bearing from the compliant elastin network to the stiffer collagen fibres. While this phenomenon has been widely investigated in animal models, human studies are lacking due to shortage of donors’ arteries. This work aimed to characterise the effect of ageing on the mechanical properties of the human aortic wall in the circumferential direction. N = 127 thoracic aortic rings (age 18–81 years) were subjected to circumferential tensile testing. The tangential elastic modulus (Kθθθθ) was calculated at pressure-equivalent stresses ranging 60–100 mmHg. Further, the mechanical data were fitted using the Holzpafel-Gasser-Ogden hyperelastic strain energy function (HGO-SEF), modelling the superimposed response of an isotropic matrix (elastin) reinforced by collagen fibres. Kθθθθ increased with age across at all considered pressures (p < 0.001), although more strongly at higher pressures. Indeed, the slope of the linear Kθθθθ-pressure relationship increased by 300% from donors <30 to ≥70 years (4.72± 2.95 to 19.06± 6.82 kPa/mmHg, p < 0.001). The HGO-SEF elastin stiffness-like parameter dropped by 31% between 30 and 40 years (p < 0.05) with non-significant changes thereafter. Conversely, changes in HGO-SEF collagen parameters were observed later at age>60 years, with the exponential constant increasing by ∼20–50 times in the investigated age range (p < 0.001). The results provided evidence that the human thoracic aorta undergoes stiffening during its life-course. Constitutive modelling suggested that these changes in arterial mechanics are related to the different degeneration time-courses of elastin and collagen; likely due to considerable fragmentation of elastin first, with the load bearing shifting from the compliant elastin to the stiffer collagen fibres. This process leads to a gradual impairment of the aortic elastic function with age.

AB  - Cervical smear screening is an imaging-based cancer detection tool, which is of pivotal importance for the early-stage diagnosis. A computer-aided screening system can automatically find out if the scanned whole-slide images (WSI) with cervical cells are classified as “abnormal” or “normal”, and then alert pathologists. It can significantly reduce the workload for human experts, and is therefore highly demanded in clinical practice. Most of the screening methods are based on automatic cervical cell detection and classification, but the accuracy is generally limited due to the high variation of cell appearance and lacking context information from the surroundings. Here we propose a novel and hierarchical framework for automatic cervical smear screening aiming at the robust performance of case-level diagnosis and finding suspected “abnormal” cells. Our framework consists of three stages. We commence by extracting a large number of pathology images from the scanned WSIs, and implementing abnormal cell detection to each pathology image. Then, we feed the detected “abnormal” cells with corresponding confidence into our novel classification model for a comprehensive analysis of the extracted pathology images. Finally, we summarize the classification outputs of all extracted images, and determine the overall screening result for the target case. Experiments show that our three-stage hierarchical method can effectively suppress the errors from cell-level detection, and provide an effective and robust way for cervical abnormality screening.

AB  - Supplying training to drivers that teaches them about automated driving and requests to intervene may help them to build and maintain a mental representation of how automation works and thereby improve takeover performance. We aimed to investigate the effect of different types of training programmes about the functioning of automated driving on drivers’ takeover performance during real driving. Fifty-two participants were split into three groups for training sessions: paper (short notice), video (3-minute tutorial) and practice (short drive). After the training, participants experienced automated driving and both urgent and non-urgent requests to intervene in a Wizard-of-Oz vehicle on public roads. Participants’ takeover time, visual behaviour, mental workload, and flow levels during the requests to intervene were assessed. Our results indicated that in urgent circumstances, participants’ takeover response times were faster in the practice training condition compared to the other training conditions. Nevertheless, the practice training session did not present any other positive effect on drivers’ visual behaviour. This could indicate that prior training, particularly when reinforcing drivers' motor skills, improved their takeover response time at the latest motor stages rather than in the early sensory states. In addition, the analysis of in-vehicle videos revealed that participants’ attention was captured in the first place by the in-vehicle human-machine interface during the urgent request to intervene. This highlights the importance for designers to display information on the HMI in an appropriate way to optimise drivers’ situation awareness in critical situations.

AB  - Background
In recent years, a remarkable trend in neurorehabilitation is the combination of conventional methods and emerging technologies, such as robotic platforms with virtual reality (VR), Serious Games (SG) and other types of sophisticated graphic interfaces. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the influence on the user's mental workload of the degree of graphic detail present in this kind of environments, comparing the experience of subjects working with two graphical environments with the same physical load but radically different graphic detail levels.
Methods
The same therapy is performed by 52 healthy subjects in two totally different graphic environments, one rich in details and visual stimuli, and its schematic version focusing just in the target graphic elements. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, related to emotional state, is analyzed through the capture and processing of associated physiological signals. The SAM test is used to assess the subjective perception of the participants in order to establish a relationship with the calculated physiological parameters.
Results
Indexes calculated from the ANS physiological signals show significant differences between the basal state and those corresponding to the performance of the therapies but do not allow discriminating between the effects of performing a therapy based on an environment rich in stimuli and an austere one. In the case of subjective perceptions, based on the results of the SAM test, the subjects perceive significant differences between the basal stage and the therapies, and also between each of the two graphic environments.
Conclusions
Users reflected that a graphic environment rich in detail was more pleasant and attractive than a schematic one. However, this is not reflected in values obtained from their physiological activity, which suggests that more research is needed about the online inference of the emotional state of the subject from the record of his physiological activity.

AB  - Operating Theaters are among the most critical parts in hospitals. Generally, an Operating Theater consists of three stages: Public Health Unit (PHU), Operating Rooms, and Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Operating Theater significantly affects annual costs and revenues of a hospital due to requiring skillful staff and expensive equipment to operate surgeries beside high service fees. In this paper, proposing an operating theater daily schedule to serve surgical demands is considered as a three-stage flow-shop scheduling problem. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed integer programming model aiming to balance workload of operating rooms and surgeons, minimize waiting times and maximize human (surgeons) reliability. Weighted-sum method and an augmented ɛ-constraint method are applied to solve two test problems. Analysis of obtained solutions verifies that both solution approaches are capable of providing appropriate schedules in a reasonable time.

AB  - A new HMI concept for urban driving consisting of the in-vehicle components Head-Up Display, the Instrument Cluster and the Acceleration Force Feedback Pedal is used in this paper to inform and warn the driver with visual and haptic feedback. Different Advanced Driver Assistant Systems, like a traffic sign assistant and a speed assistant, are embedded in this concept. The study shows great potential in the operation of an integrative HMI concept for the above-mentioned ADAS in urban areas. While the workload remains the same, even with additional information and warnings for the driver, several advantages exist, such as maintaining the speed limit or driving economically efficient. The results will help to further develop this HMI concept, while maintaining the need to be able to drive safely and efficiently in urban areas.

AB  - Facility layout problem is a well-researched problem of finding configurations of departments and machines on a plant floor with the objective of improving material handling efficiency. With this objective, different techniques of configuring facilities have been documented in literature. Among them are cellular and distributed layouts. Cellular layouts are applicable in scenarios where demand and product mix are relatively stable and rational part families/machine cells can be identified. With this assumption, the literature provides many techniques for their design. Distributed layout, on the other hand, are recommended in volatile environments where product demand and mix are changing very rapidly. However, we argue that a real-life scenario may lay within the spectrum of these two extremes. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by developing a mathematical model that integrates distributed layout design and machine cell formation with an objective to minimize a weighted sum of material handling and inter cellular movement costs. Through distributing the machines over the shop floor, the model attempts to minimize material handling cost. By identifying possible machine cells and part families, it attempts to minimize inter cellular movements. At the same time, the model ensures that machines that belong to the same cell are laid out on contiguous physical locations so that the advantages of cellular manufacturing systems can be fully exploited. Operations sequence, alternative routing, workload balancing among cells and other pragmatic issues are also incorporated in the model. We developed a parallel multiple search path simulated annealing to solve the proposed model efficiently. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrated the model and the computational performance of the developed algorithm.

AB  - In high performance computing systems, I/O congestion is a common problem in large-scale distributed file systems. However, the current implementation mainly requires administrator to manually design low-level implementation and optimization, we proposes an adaptive I/O congestion control framework, named AIOC2, which can not only adaptively tune the I/O congestion control parameters, but also exploit the deep Q-learning method to start the training parameters and optimize the tuning for different types of workloads from the server and the client at the same time. AIOC2 combines the feedback-based dynamic I/O congestion control and deep Q-learning parameter tuning technology to achieve autonomic I/O congestion control, improve system I/O throughput, and thus reduce I/O latency without human interference. Experimental results show that AIOC2 can greatly reduce the impact of I/O congestion on I/O throughput and I/O latency performance in Lustre clusters. Compared to existing Lustre cluster systems, AIOC2 can increase write I/O throughput by 34.82% and decrease I/O latency by 26.17% on average.

AB  - Background and objective
Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease caused by a high rate of bone tissue loss, and it is a major cause of bone fracture. In contemporary society, osteoporosis is more common than cancer and stroke and results in a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in the human population. Osteoporosis can conclusively be diagnosed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this study, we propose a computer-aided osteoporosis detection (CAOD) technique that automatically measures bone mineral density (BMD) and generates an osteoporosis report from a DXA scan.
Methods
The CAOD model denoise and segments DXA images using a non-local mean filter, Machine learning pixel label random forest respectively, and locates regions of interest with higher accuracy. Pixel label random forest classifies a pixel either bone or soft tissue; then contours are extracted from binary image to locate regions of interest and calculate BMD from bone and soft tissues pixels. Mean standard deviation and correlation coefficients statistical analysis were used to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of BMD measurements.
Results
During a consistency test of BMD measurements using three consecutive scans from Computerized Imaging Reference Systems’ Bona Fide Phantom (CIRS-BFP) for the spine, the CAOD model showed an averaged standard deviation of 0.0029 while the standard deviation from manual measurements on the same data set by three different individuals was recorded as 0.1199. During another correlation study of BMD measurements evaluating real human scan images by the CAOD model versus manual measurement, the model scored a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9901 while the CIRS-BFP study scored a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9709.
Conclusions
The CAOD model increases the preciseness and accuracy of BMD measurements. This CAOD method will help clinicians, untrained DXA operators, and researchers (medical scientists, doctors, and bone researchers) use the DXA system with reliable accuracy and overcome workload challenges. It will also improve osteoporosis diagnosis from DXA systems and increase system performance and value.

AB  - Traditional disassembly methods, such as manual and robotic disassembly, are no longer competent for the requirement of the complexity of the disassembly product. Therefore, the human-robot collaboration concept can be introduced to realize a novel disassembly system, towards increasing the flexibility and adaptability of them. In order to facilitate the efficient and smooth human-robot collaboration in disassembly, it is necessary to make the disassembly system more intelligent. In this paper, a robotic knowledge graph is proposed to provide an assistant for those who lack the relevant knowledge to complete the disassembly task. By natural language processing method, this paper extracts entities and relationships from the disassembly data to build a knowledge base in the form of knowledge graph. Combining graph-based knowledge representation, a prototype system is developed for human to acquire, analyze and manage the disassembly knowledge. Finally, a case study demonstrates that the proposed robotic knowledge graph has savings in terms of disassembly time, idle time and human workload, and it can be applied to assist human operator in disassembly by providing human and robots with various kinds of the needed knowledge.

AB  - Background
As patient’s length of stay in waiting lists increases, governments are looking for strategies to control the problem. Agreements were created with private providers to diminish the workload in the public sector. However, the growth of the private sector is not following the demand for care. Given this context, new management strategies have to be considered in order to minimize patient length of stay in waiting lists while reducing the costs and increasing (or at least maintaining) the quality of care.
Method
Appointment scheduling systems are today known to be proficient in the optimization of health care services. Their utilization is focused on increasing the usage of human resources, medical equipment and reducing the patient waiting times. In this paper, a simulation-based optimization approach to the Patient Admission Scheduling Problem is presented. Modeling tools and simulation techniques are used in the optimization of a diagnostic imaging department.
Results
The proposed techniques have demonstrated to be effective in the evaluation of diagnostic imaging workflows. A simulated annealing algorithm was used to optimize the patient admission sequence towards minimizing the total completion and total waiting of patients. The obtained results showed average reductions of 5% on the total completion and 38% on the patients’ total waiting time.

AB  - Process, Voltage, and Temperature variations together with transistor Aging (PVTA) can result in significant number of timing errors in Custom Instructions (CIs) manufactured at nano-scaled silicon nodes. The state-of-the-art approach to tackle this concern is to use guard-band. However, this policy can adversely decrease the performance gain obtained by CIs as the gap between worst-case delay and true delay due to PVTA variations is increased. This paper proposes a novel approximate CI selection technique to address this issue. This technique allows the applications which do not require perfect accuracy to experience a tolerable amount of timing errors imposed by PVTA variations in favor of significantly improving the performance of the extensible processor. To achieve this, the proposed CI selection technique not only considers those CIs which their PVTA-aware delay is less than the given timing constraint, but also it takes into account the approximate CIs (i.e., those CIs that cannot strictly meet the timing constraint resulting in noisy/approximate computations). First, a timing analysis is performed to precisely compute the delay distribution of CIs in the presence of workload- and circuit-dependent PVTA variations. Then, based on the obtained distribution for each CI, a fault-map (i.e., timing error locations) is extracted. Using the fault-map, each circuit-level timing error is propagated to application-level to evaluate the quality/accuracy of the application output in the presence of PVTA-induced errors in approximate CIs. Finally, based on this cross-layer information, an optimal set of CIs is selected. This set results in maximum performance per silicon area under the given constraints on the power consumption and the errors which can be tolerated by the user. The simulations for various benchmark applications show that the proposed cross-layer technique results in up to 2.7× speedup increase compared to the existing techniques, which comes at the expense of 6% more error.

AB  - Background
Preventable patient harm, particularly medication errors, represent significant challenges in healthcare settings. Dispensing the wrong medication is often associated with mix-up of lookalike and soundalike drugs in high workload environments. Replacing manual dispensing with automated unit dose and medication dispensing systems to reduce medication errors is not always feasible in clinical facilities experiencing high patient turn-around or frequent dose changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) based pill recognition tools and smartphone applications could potentially aid healthcare workers in identifying pills in situations where more advanced dispensing systems are not implemented.
Objective
Most of the published research on pill recognition focuses on theoretical aspects of model development using traditional coding and deep learning methods. The use of code-free deep learning (CFDL) as a practical alternative for accessible model development, and implementation of such models in tools intended to aid decision making in clinical settings, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we sought to address this gap in existing literature by investigating whether CFDL is a viable approach for developing pill recognition models using a custom dataset, followed by a thorough evaluation of the model across various deployment scenarios, and in multicenter clinical settings. Furthermore, we aimed to highlight challenges and propose solutions to achieve optimal performance and real-world applicability of pill recognition models, including when deployed on smartphone applications.
Methods
A pill recognition model was developed utilizing Microsoft Azure Custom Vision platform and a large custom training dataset of 26,880 images captured from the top 30 most dispensed solid oral dosage forms (SODFs) at the three participating hospitals. A comprehensive internal and external testing strategy was devised, model's performance was investigated through the online API, and offline using exported TensorFlow Lite model running on a Windows PC and on Android, using a tailor-made testing smartphone application. Additionally, model's calibration, degree of reliance on color features and device dependency was thoroughly evaluated. Real-world performance was assessed using images captured by hospital pharmacists at three participating clinical centers.
Results
The pill recognition model showed high performance in Microsoft Azure Custom Vision platform with 98.7 % precision, 95.1 % recall, and 98.2 % mean average precision (mAP), with thresholds set to 50 %. During internal testing utilizing the online API, the model reached 93.7 % precision, 88.96 % recall, 90.81 % F1-score and 87.35 % mAP. Testing the offline TensorFlow Lite model on Windows PC showed a slight performance reduction, with 91.16 % precision, 83.82 % recall, 86.18 % F1-score and 82.55 % mAP. Performance of the model running offline on the Android application was further reduced to 86.50 % precision, 75.00 % recall, 77.83 % F1-score and 69.24 % mAP. During external clinical testing through the online API an overall precision of 83.10 %, recall of 71.39 %, and F1-score of 75.76 % was achieved.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that using a CFDL approach is a feasible and cost-effective method for developing AI-based pill recognition systems. Despite the limitations encountered, our model performed well, particularly when accessed through the online API. The use of CFDL facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, resulting in human-centered AI models with enhanced real-world applicability. We suggest that rather than striving to build a universally applicable pill recognition system, models should be tailored to the medications in a regional formulary or needs of a specific clinic, which can in turn lead to improved performance in real-world deployment in these locations. Parallel to focusing on model development, it is crucial to employ a human centered approach by training the end users on how to properly interact with the AI based system to maximize benefits. Future research is needed on refining pill recognition models for broader adaptability. This includes investigating image pre-processing and optimization techniques to enhance offline performance and operation on handheld devices. Moreover, future studies should explore methods to overcome limitations of CFDL development to enhance the robustness of models and reduce overfitting. Collaborative efforts between researchers in this domain and sharing of best practices are vital to improve pill recognition systems, ultimately enhancing patient safety and healthcare outcomes.

In this work, we expose a multi-objective problem where the idea is to minimize three objectives simultaneously. The first one considers the minimization of the total flow time of jobs in the production system, then the workload balancing concerning both, humans and machines is addressed. We propose and compare two multi-objective methods: NSGA-II and NSGA-III. Computational experiments are designed according to the literature, we expose the small and large sized instances to present the general performance of these algorithms using the hyper-volume metric to compare them.

AB  - The inclusion of human factors (HF) in mathematical models is proving crucial to allow complex driving behaviour and interactions to be explicitly considered to capture driving phenomena. An important area where such integration is required is for the role of anticipation by drivers to compensate for critical traffic situations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Anticipation Reliance (AR), which acts as a demand lowering compensative effect for the driving task by relying more on anticipation. We implement AR in a generic multi-scale microscopic traffic modelling and simulation framework to explore and explain the effects of HF on traffic operations and safety in critical traffic situations. This concept addresses a disparity in the description of driver workload in relation to the execution of driving tasks in regard to the confidence that drivers place on tasks that are sub-consciously catered for. The crossover from HF to a mathematical description of this role of AR introduces a ground-breaking concept that explains and models the mechanisms that allow drivers to compensate and avoid accidents in many circumstances, even when driving errors or sub-optimal driving performance occurs. By and large, the HF effects can be subdivided in effects on perception and anticipation; effects on sensitivity and response to stimuli; and effects on personal attributes and characteristics. A key aspect of the framework are two intertwined driver-specific mental state variables—total workload and awareness—that bridge between classic collision-free idealized models for lane changing and car following, and HF models that explain under which conditions the performance of drivers deteriorates in terms of reaction time, sensitivity to stimuli or other parameters. In this paper, we focus on the awareness construct, as described by AR, and explore the effects. We prove the effectiveness of the approach with a case example that demonstrates the ability of the model to dissect a complex traffic situation with both longitudinal and lateral driving tasks, while endogenously considering human factors and that produces accident avoidance and occurrence within the same order of magnitude compared to real traffic accident statistics.

AB  - We present MacKenzie, a HPC-driven multi-cluster workflow system that was used repeatedly to configure and execute fine-grained US national-scale epidemic simulation models during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mackenzie supported federal and Virginia policymakers, in real-time, for a large number of “what-if” scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continues to be used to answer related questions as COVID-19 transitions to the endemic stage of the disease. MacKenzie is a novel HPC meta-scheduler that can execute US-scale simulation models and associated workflows that typically present significant big data challenges. The meta-scheduler optimizes the total execution time of simulations in the workflow, and helps improve overall human productivity. As an exemplar of the kind of studies that can be conducted using Mackenzie, we present a modeling study to understand the impact of vaccine-acceptance in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the US. We use a 288 million node synthetic social contact network (digital twin) spanning all 50 US states plus Washington DC, comprised of 3300 counties, with 12 billion daily interactions. The highly-resolved agent-based model used for the epidemic simulations uses realistic information about disease progression, vaccine uptake, production schedules, acceptance trends, prevalence, and social distancing guidelines. Computational experiments show that, for the simulation workload discussed above, MacKenzie is able to scale up well to 10 K CPU cores. Our modeling results show that, when compared to faster and accelerating vaccinations, slower vaccination rates due to vaccine hesitancy cause averted infections to drop from 6.7M to 4.5M, and averted total deaths to drop from 39.4 K to 28.2 K across the US. This occurs despite the fact that the final vaccine coverage is the same in both scenarios. We also find that if vaccine acceptance could be increased by 10% in all states, averted infections could be increased from 4.5M to 4.7M (a 4.4% improvement) and total averted deaths could be increased from 28.2 K to 29.9 K (a 6% improvement) nationwide.

AB  - Focussed ultrasound can be used to create the sensation of touch in mid-air. Combined with gestures, this can provide haptic feedback to guide users, thereby overcoming the lack of agency associated with pure gestural interfaces, and reducing the need for vision – it is therefore particularly apropos of the driving domain. In a counter-balanced 2 × 2 driving simulator study, a traditional in-vehicle touchscreen was compared with a virtual mid-air gestural interface, both with and without ultrasound haptics. Forty-eight experienced drivers (28 male, 20 female) undertook representative in-vehicle tasks – discrete target selections and continuous slider-bar manipulations – whilst driving. Results show that haptifying gestures with ultrasound was particularly effective in reducing visual demand (number of long glances and mean off-road glance time), and increasing performance (shortest interaction times, highest number of correct responses and least ‘overshoots’) associated with continuous tasks. In contrast, for discrete, target-selections, the touchscreen enabled the highest accuracy and quickest responses, particularly when combined with haptic feedback to guide interactions, although this also increased visual demand. Subjectively, the gesture interfaces invited higher ratings of arousal compared to the more familiar touch-surface technology, and participants indicated the lowest levels of workload (highest performance, lowest frustration) associated with the gesture-haptics interface. In addition, gestures were preferred by participants for continuous tasks. The study shows practical utility and clear potential for the use of haptified gestures in the automotive domain.

AB  - In the current situation of fluctuating demands and market driven turbulences, new part manufactures have to deal with many turbulence factors. Companies operating in the MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) sector have to additionally deal with major variations of work load and work contents. In addition, the operational processes of the maintenance contractors are strongly affected by the influence of the customers. The delivery date of the corresponding order is highly influenced by the customer. Besides the information about the actual work load is only completely known when the inspection is completed. Since the planning of the maintenance event and the maintenance operation are hard to handle, the focus of the approach presented in this paper is set on improving the maintenance operation by finding suitable scheduling rules for the job-shop operation of the maintenance. We hypothesize that the use of scheduling rules can improve the maintenance operation. The main question which is answered in this paper is the question if an improvement of the logistical targets of the maintenance system can be accomplished with the use of decentralized scheduling rules. As part of the examination, a systematic simulation based approach for the identification of scheduling rules is defined. Due to the need of different studies, a simulation model is developed. With this model, the different simulation studies can easily be accomplished. The simulation results show an influence of the decentralized scheduling before each of the machine tools. The best results were achieved by the combinations of FIFO/Slack and ESD/Slack with an influence on the target values on-time delivery, work in progress, the throughput, the performance and the throughput time. Further on a tool for the implementation of the identified scheduling rule in a decentralized shop control is described. Besides the validation of the tool in an aircraft engine company is made. The application of a Slack rule during a period with increased workload of 36% showed a nearly constant on-time delivery.

AB  - The issue of driving performance after sleeping becomes highly interesting when introducing automated driving in Level 4 (SAE). It is known that fatigue as well as hypovigilance are severe risk factors for traffic accidents while an effective countermeasure is sleeping. In Level 4 automation sleeping while driving becomes a possible scenario, including the issues of transitions. Several seconds for take-over as known from distraction studies are not enough to adjust the seat, regain control and recover after sleeping. Furthermore, when analyzing human performance after sleeping, the phenomenon of sleep inertia may affect reaction time and quality of performance. Take-over time and the effect of sleep inertia are investigated in a driving simulator study with 44 participants. As independent variable, the time after waking-up until taking over is varied: The participants had to take-over the driving task one minute, seven minutes or 15 min after waking up. A control group completed the task without sleeping. Lane keeping, deviation of line during the lane change task, braking time and mental workload served as dependent variables. There were no significant differences in driving performance between the groups when looking at driving performance, safety aspects and mental workload, hence no effect of sleep inertia was measured here. Further studies should investigate individual performance of more outliers and apply even more controlled measures to understand better if and how sleep inertia can become a problem for driving and what countermeasures should be applied. The study also shows, that take-over time of one minute leads to successful, but hectic take-overs, whereas a take-over time of 15 min induces fatigue in some drivers. We conclude that powernaps have a good chance to become a safe reality in Level 4 automation with a suitable take-over time between one and seven minutes.

AB  - As more and more powerful integrated circuits are appearing on the market, more and more applications, with very different requirements and workloads, are making use of available computing power. Designing optimized accelerators that can meet particular requirements has always presented a tremendous challenge to hardware engineers. To do so, designers have to trade off performance for power consumption in a manner such that the final RTL consumes minimum energy to meet the required performance (e.g. FLOPS) target. Moreover, the growing trend towards heterogeneous platforms is crucial to meet time and power consumption constraints of high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The OpenCL parallel programming language and framework enables programming CPU, GPU and recently FPGAs using the high-level synthesis (HLS) methodology. This work presents a design space exploration flow based on execution time, resource utilization and power consumption of OpenCL kernels mapped on FPGAs using the Xilinx high-level synthesis tool chain. Our experiments suggest that the quality of generated solutions, in terms of performance-per-watt, can be determined using analytical formulas prior to implementation, thus enabling fast and accurate DSE by considering on-chip and off-chip sources of parallelism. Moreover, the automated flow suggests design hints to meet a given time constraint within available resources. The proposed technique is demonstrated by optimizing the well known bitonic sorting network from NVIDIA’s OpenCL benchmark. Our results report that FPGAs have at least 20% higher performance-per-watt with respect to two high-end GPUs manufactured in the same technology (28 nm). Additionally, FPGAs with more available resources and using a more modern process (20 nm) can outperform the tested GPUs while consuming at least 55% less power at the cost of more expensive devices.

KW  - Tool path generation
KW  - Cutting contact points
KW  - Constant chord error
KW  - Safety tool orientation
AB  - Tool path generation is an important step of five-axis NC milling which plays an important role in parametric surfaces and free-form surfaces manufacturing. Cutter contacting (CC) point calculation is considered as a basic procedure of tool path generation. The step lengths formed by cutter contacting points have an effect on the chord error along feed direction. In traditional calculation method for CC point discretization, the segments connected by adjacent CC points distribute on both sides of the theoretical tool path curve. This situation magnifies the cutting error to some extent and enlarges the expected margin if the surface demands polishing or grinding. Aiming at this issue, this paper proposes an improved constant chord error method for CC point calculation. In the proposed method, the CC points lay on the theoretical tool path curve when the tool path curve is concave and lay on the chord error offset curve when is convex, which ensures the segments connected by the adjacent CC points distribute on one side of design surface, the side of the scallop height between tool paths. Therefore, the actual margin of polishing or grinding can be reduced. The influence of inflection points is also considered in this method to avoid accuracy deterioration caused by the long steps occurring near the inflection points. In part processing, local gouging and global collision must be avoided in tool orientation determination. This paper analyzes tool orientations with no rear gouging and no collision based on the calculated CC points. The novel discretization method for CC points is calculated on a single blade model, and the tool orientations are generated on an open integral impeller. A DMG DMU50 machine tool and a Hexagon three coordinates measuring machine are applied for experiments and measurements. The results show that, the CC point discretization method proposed in this paper offers many advantages over the traditional constant chord error method and commercial software, such as quantity of points, curve fitting, no overcut, and residual margin distributing. At last, blade and tunnel of the open integral impeller with safety tool orientation is machined and verified on the DMG DMU50 machine tool.

AB  - Broaching is extensively used in aerospace industry due to the good dimensional quality and surface integrity condition obtained. However, the coupled workload of heat and cutting forces make broaching tool having the problem of serious wear. Many studies have shown that the use of biomimetic microstructure can reduce the cutting load, but the load reduction mechanism is unclear. In this regard, a novel dry broaching experiment, inspired by the dung beetle surface, was designed to investigate the load reduction mechanism of microstructure broach. To reveal the mechanism, the broaching load, chip reduction coefficient and tool-chip adhesion length were compared with four kinds of rake face microstructures, which is conventional broach (without microstructures), biomimetic one (BM), micro-pit (PM) and micro-groove (GM). And all of above microstructures were fabricated by single point diamond tool (SPDT). It can be found that the biomimetic microstructure (BM) can reduce more tool-chip contact area, meanwhile enhance the ability of capturing debris. Otherwise, the obtained results revealed that biomimetic microstructures (BM) broach could reduce broaching load, chip reduction coefficient and tool-chip adhesion length by amount of 12.31 %, 8.23 % and 18.38 % compared to conventional one, respectively.

Contemporary research shows that one operator managing multiple robotic assets suffers from a variety of performance decrements. Using an intelligent agent as the mediator of the robotic team helps alleviate some problems, while introducing several unique to the supervisory relationship. One such problem is the human-out-of-the-loop condition, which often results in an increase in operator complacent behavior. This proposed study explores how operator knowledge of the work environment and access to the agent's reasoning affects complacent behavior. Additionally, the interaction of operator knowledge and agent reasoning will be explored to see how the presence (or lack thereof) of each affects operator performance, workload, and situation awareness.

AB  - To formulate a systematic and scientific nurse scheduling plan based on the nurse rostering problem (NRP), individual preferences and legal and other constraints must be fully considered. The NRP aims to optimize the allocation of human resources and to effectively reduce the workload to improve the efficiency and quality of nurses’ work. As various constraints must be considered, the NRP is complicated and is known to be NP-hard. The fast attainment of an efficient schedule is a challenging problem that requires urgent resolution. In this paper, we propose a neural network-assisted method for automating the complex and costly design of the heuristics. The method integrates a generic deep neural network (DNN) model and a generic recurrent neural network (RNN) model. The DNN model is used to guide the heuristic selection; the RNN model is embedded into the reconstruction mechanism to escape the local optimum. By treating schedules as matrices, the neural networks can help decide which heuristic to apply next and generate feasible solutions. Four experiments with different focuses based on benchmark instances are conducted by comparing different parameters as well as other state-of-the-art methods. Detailed computational results revealed the performance of the proposed method, results from the proposed algorithm outperforms the results reported in recent literature and state-of-the-art heuristic approaches in at least half of the instances, the proposed method also shows better performance compared with three reproduced deep reinforcement (DRL) learning methods, it is also competitive as an component of the hybrid method.

AB  - Driver comprehension is a substantial component of situation awareness that involves the ability of an individual to understand the significance of an object, traffic sign, or hazard while driving. An increase in crashes related to autonomous driving systems has raised a concern regarding the safety of other roadway users due to the diminishing accountability resulting from a general lack of understanding of the limitations or disregard of the safety protocols by users. To keep drivers vigilant when engaged in partial automated systems, a methodology to monitor real-time driver comprehension was proposed. A driving simulator study consisting of 90 participants, equally split between males and females, was executed to establish driver comprehension in six different variations of driving difficulty. Joint probability density functions were created by considering percent time spent gazing, answers to probe questions, and driving performance. Based on these density functions, five levels of comprehension were devised and assigned thresholds. Overall, as task difficulty increased, a non-linear deterioration in driving speed along with an increase in total gaze duration was observed before comprehension was attained. A two-step validation protocol was also proposed to ensure similar levels of comprehension to non-automated driving from the human driver, when engaged in early forms of automation. The proposed real-time driver comprehension monitoring constitutes a first step toward developing a methodology to reinstate the accountability of safety of other roadway users when engaged in driver-in-the-loop automation systems.

T1  - Human-Machine Interaction in Future Nuclear Power Plant Control Rooms – A Review⁎⁎This work is supported in part by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Project No.2019B1515120060), and the Open Funds of State Key Due to the complexity of nuclear power systems, the nuclear safety accidents that have occurred are usually caused by human faulty operations. In the Chernobyl accident, a series of operational errors during the turbine test by the operators led to the most serious nuclear leakage accident in history (Onisawa & Nishiwaki, 1988). To design a safe nuclear power control system, we need to consider not only the rationality of the operation, but also the HMI issues including reliability, convenience and comfort (Lagari et al., 2016). The nuclear power control system with great interaction effect can effectively reduce the physical and mental pressure of the operators, the complexity of observation data and the steps required for proper operation. Thereby it enhances the safety of the entire NPP. Thus, HMI in the control room is vital for successful design of future NPP control system.

AB  - In nuclear power plants, many accidents are caused by human errors. As a result, to be vigilant about the risks during human-machine interaction (HMI) is becoming critical. An effective HMI system can reduce the operators’ workload and feedback the operators’ status in real time, thus it will greatly reduce these risks. Based on this, it is necessary to discuss the topic of HMI in nuclear power control. In this work, the authors review the development of nuclear power interaction system and briefly analyze the current limitations. Then the paper summarizes the explorations in nuclear power HMI based on artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years, and conceive a multi-modal intelligent nuclear power control room. The authors believe that if people want to improve the efficiency and accuracy of nuclear power HMI, it is important to apply new interaction methods and improve the evaluation system for the operating system. In this process, AI will be an important driving force. This work will be important reference for future research in nuclear power HMI.

AB  - The frequency of serious epidemics has continued to increase in the last decade. The ability to predict the risk of outbreaks can improve prevention and control. There are few prediction models available, and of these most are manually constructed by human experts. These manual models are affected by the lack of automation and have limitations in data processing. They can be enhanced with modern machine-learning techniques. Machine learning (ML) based prediction models, however, have higher requirement for professional knowledge and are not broadly accessible to researchers who do not have ML expertise. We proposed automated machine learning (AutoML) as an advanced solution. It automates the entire ML design process for users without requiring ML knowledge, therefore allows non-ML experts to individually build ML models. To demonstrate the functionality of AutoML to develop reliable systems, we expanded an existing manually developed risk analysis model, EPIRISK, that uses economic, social and medical risk factors to predict epidemic risk. Using the AutoML platform BrewAI, we obtained an automatically generated ML model to predict epidemic risk. This was compared with six traditionally built machine learning models. The AutoML tool generated a model of 77% accuracy in predicting risk. It had similar accuracy to the six traditional built ML models. Such tools are easy to use and could make ML models more accessible to non-ML experts.

AB  - Comparative radiography (CR) is the forensic anthropology technique in which ante-mortem (AM) and post-mortem (PM) radiographic materials (e.g., X-ray images or CTs) are compared in order to determine the identity of a human being (either by providing a positive identification or by reducing the number of candidates). One of the most commonly used anatomical structures in CR are the frontal sinuses, which are used in forensic human identification tasks due to their singularity and high identification power. In order to automate the comparison of frontal sinuses in AM and PM materials, we need to perform their segmentation and registration. However, these tasks are time-consuming, subjective, and complex. This paper presents the first CR-based identification system for the comparison of frontal sinuses and supporting the forensic expert’s decision. The proposed system comprises two building blocks. First, a frontal sinus segmentation method in X-ray images using deep convolutional neural networks. Different convolutional architectures are compared in solving the segmentation problem, obtaining an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of the frontal sinuses of 0.823 on a dataset composed of 234 skull radiographs. Second, an evolutionary-based 2D-3D IR method, that searches for the best alignment of segmented AM and PM images using a real-coded evolutionary algorithm. The proposed system is evaluated on a real multiple-comparison identification scenario including 10 X-ray images and 10 CTs, where manual and automatic segmentation approaches are compared. The global results shows that the proposed system is able to filter 50% of the sample. These preliminary results suggest that our system can reliably keep the true positive identity in the first half of the sample, allowing for a significant reduction of forensic experts’ workload and shortening identification times.

AB  - In conditionally automated driving, a human takeover transition is necessary in response to vehicle malfunction or other limitation. To mitigate the negative experience of this technological limitation, researchers have suggested providing an explanation along with the takeover request to increase drivers’ understanding and trust in an automated driving system (ADS). However, previous studies on the explanation have been limited to investigations of unimodal explanations that use either text or speech, while neglecting other various in-vehicle display options. The present study aims to investigate the effects of multimodal explanation using three in-vehicle displays—ambient light, cluster, and sound. The explanation given by each in-vehicle display was systemically manipulated into two levels (ambient light: constant color vs. variable color, cluster: no-text and no-background vs. text with colored background, sound: alert-only sound vs. speech with alert sound). To examine the effects of the explanation using these displays, we conducted mixed method research including a scenario-based experiment, questionnaires, and a follow-up interview for thematic analysis. In the experiment, eighty-two participants drove in a driving simulator and performed takeover tasks in several types of urgent situations for measuring their takeover time and error. The participants then responded to questionnaires on takeover workload and overall trust in automated vehicle. Next, fifty-six of them participated in the follow-up interview for discovering significant themes related to their experiences with the multimodal explanation. As results, we found that multimodal explanations that use two types of displays were more effective than unimodal explanations or multimodal explanations using three types of displays. Regarding the effects of each type of display, the speech-based explanation showed the best takeover performance in general. The explanation using the cluster was next most useful in performance. The ambient light explanation showed less significant to no effect in the takeover situation. We expect that these findings can contribute to theoretical understanding of driver response to multimodal explanations and to practical design of trustworthy explanations in various takeover situations.

AB  - The hip is the strongest joint of the human body. A wide range of disorders and fractures can affect the hip. The use of therapeutic robots has the potential to reduce the physical workload of rehabilitation and to improve repeatability. In this paper, a simple hip-joint rehabilitation robot (HipBot) is presented to perform combined movements of abduction/adduction and flexion/extension. HipBot has 5-DOF and can perform combined movements. This system can learn specific exercise motions through a GUI and perform them without the physiotherapist. In addition, HipBot is capable of performing rehabilitation on both right and left legs (individually). The simple mechanism covers the requirements of stability and robustness necessary for hip-joint rehabilitation. The mechatronic design and control technique are described. The robot system was tested in a small group of healthy subjects. The experimental results carried out on healthy subjects proved the high performance of the rehabilitation device and showed its great potential.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate a scenario of human-robot collaboration mainly motivated by agricultural applications, and present a novel control architecture with variable autonomy based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression. The system consists of three components, namely a robot manipulator, system operator, and computer. The operator monitors an image, acquired by the robot, capturing possibly multiple candidates for a target to be reached by the end effector of the robot. He/she chooses a target to be reached among these candidates, and determines a velocity command for the end effector, while the computer also identifies a target through image processing. We first design an automatic controller and a mechanism to tune autonomy online. To this end, we build two GP models from the data on a training system without any uncertain factor that may disturb the operation: one is built from the data of an expert for the system operation and the other is from the operator’s own data. The former model is utilized as the automatic controller and the autonomy determination mechanism is designed based on the variance information provided by the GP models so that the controller supports the manual control only when the expert’s model is reliable, the computer correctly identifies the human target, and the real environment does not contain any uncertain factor that affects manual control. We finally demonstrate the mechanism through experiments from the viewpoints of the performance and human workload.

AB  - Purpose
To examine whether rest intervals of different durations (“High Rest, Low Frequency” v. “Low Rest, High Frequency”), and load at different force exertion levels with different repetition frequencies (“High Load, Low Repetition” v. “Low Load, High Repetition”) have an impact on muscle micro-trauma, as such micro-trauma over repetitive loading and long-term muscle overuse can lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).
Method
Twenty-four adult males (mean age: 24.1 years; 3.6 SD) were randomly assigned to one of 4 bicep muscle eccentric exercise treatment groups (n = 6; “High Load, Low Repetition; High Rest, Low Frequency”, “High Load, Low Repetition; Low Rest, High Frequency”, “Low Load, High Repetition; High Rest, Low Frequency”, or “Low Load, High Repetition; Low Rest, High Frequency”) with non-dominant arm to induce muscle micro-trauma reactions in serum. Subjects in all treatment groups had equivalent total work volume, total rest duration and total work duration for comparison of muscle micro-trauma between and within the treatment groups. Muscle micro-trauma biomarker serum Creatine Kinase (CK) level was measured pre-exercise (Day 0) and post-exercise on Days 1, 2, 4, and 8. ANOVA with repeated measures was used to examine significance of rest and load-repetition combination over pre and post experiment days, as well as possible interactions.
Result
CK levels fluctuated significantly across different “Day” (P = 0.0115). Interaction was disordinal and significant between “Day” and “Rest” (P = 0.0000), and “Load” and “Rest” (P = 0.0322). Under “High Load, Low Repetition” condition, CK levels on Day 4 were significantly higher than on Days 0 and 2; CK levels on Day 8 were significantly higher than Day 0. CK level peaked on Day 4. Under “Low Rest” Condition, CK level on Days 4 and 8 are significantly higher than Day 0.
Conclusion
Shorter but more frequent rest intervals led to more extreme muscle micro-traumatic responses than the longer but less frequent ones, especially under “High Load, Low Repetition” condition when non-dominant bicep brachii was subscribed with eccentric exercise regimen.
Relevance to industry
The exploration of how rest scheduling affects progression of microtrauma from a biomechanical and molecular level in this study furthers current understanding of the early stage development of WMSDs. With future studies’ further research and confirmation, the findings of this study may be able to serve as a first attempt to guide shift scheduling and job design at manufacturing facilities.

AB  - Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) exhibit significant impairments in gesture imitation. Newest interventions are based on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) since children with ASD cope well with stylized, rule-based and predictable systems. These collaborative approaches encompass therapy games based on joint exercises, imitation and interaction between robots and children. This paper’s aim was to implement an algorithm to automatically recognize small and similar gestures within a humanoid-robot therapy called IOGIOCO for ASD children. IOGIOCO is a multi-level HRI therapy meant to teach 19 meaningful gestures in a semantic framework based on a feedback interaction. Gestures were tracked as 3D coordinates of body keypoints captured by a Kinect. A Residual Neural Network was implemented and trained on a segmented Dataset acquired within this study to generate the offline model which was then exploited in a real-time classification using a sliding window. Feedback as sound stimuli from NAO robot was provided based on the automatic evaluation of each performance. Clinical acquisitions were carried out on 4 ASD children within the IOGIOCO therapy. Offline recognition was successful: exploiting Artificial Neural Networks we reached 95% of test accuracy for 19 gestures. A real-time recognition on healthy subjects reached 94% accuracy. Clinical applications were evaluated through the F1 score that achieved 79% value. These outcomes were encouraging considering the wide gesture set and all the challenges the therapy raises. This kind of automatic algorithm was able to decrease the therapist workload and increase the robustness of the therapy and engagement of the child.

AB  - Various extensions of TCP/IP have been proposed to reduce network latency; examples include Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Data Center TCP (DCTCP) and several proposals for Active Queue Management (AQM). Combining these techniques requires adjusting various parameters, and recent studies have found that it is difficult to do so while obtaining both high throughput performance and low latency. This is especially true for mixed use data centres that host both latency-sensitive applications and high-throughput workloads with east–west traffic such as Hadoop. This paper studies the difficulty in configuration, and characterises the problem as related to ACK packets. Such packets cannot be set as ECN Capable Transport (ECT), with the consequence that a disproportionate number of them are dropped. The same issue can affect other non-ECT-capable traffic that may co-exist on the network. We explain how this behavior adversely affects throughput, and propose a small change to the way that non-ECT-capable packets are handled in the network switches. Using NS–2 simulation, we demonstrate robust performance for modified AQMs on a Hadoop cluster, maintaining full throughput while reducing latency by 85%. We also demonstrate that commodity switches with shallow buffers are able to reach the same throughput as deeper buffer switches. Finally, we explain how both TCP using ECN and DCTCP can achieve the best performance using a simple marking threshold, in contrast to the current preference for relying on AQMs to mark packets. Overall, we provide recommendations to network equipment manufacturers, cluster administrators and the whole industry on how best to combine high-throughput and latency-sensitive workloads. This article is an extension of our previous work [1], which was published in Proceedings of the 19th IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER 2017).

AB  - Through the application of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) organisations aim to increase their operational efficiency. In RPA, robots, or ‘bots’ for short, represent software agents capable of interacting with software systems by mimicking user actions, thus alleviating the workload of the human workforce. RPA has already seen significant uptake in practice; solution technologies are offered by multiple vendors. Contrasting with this early practical adoption is the hitherto relative lack of attention to RPA in the academic literature. As a consequence, RPA lacks the sound theoretical foundations that allow for objective reasoning around its application and development. This, in turn, hinders initiatives for achieving meaningful advances in the field. This paper presents a structured literature review that identifies a number of contemporary, RPA-related themes and challenges for future research.

AB  - While Phase Change Memory (PCM) is gaining popularity in next generation systems compared to conventional DRAM and Flash, write disturbance due to crosstalk remains a significant challenge to PCM performance and reliability. To address this concern we propose a multi-tiered compression (MTC) technique combined with novel encoding that can decrease the probability of write disturbance. MTC compresses a high proportion (>94%) of cachelines by a small predictable amount (e.g., 40- or 56-bits of a 512-bit block) while maintaining data similarity vital for optimizing PCM writes. By detecting data patterns prone to crosstalk, we use encoding, correction pointers, and a hybrid approach to reduce the instances of write disturbance. We use MTC reclaimed bits to store the encoding. Thus, our approach requires only five additional auxiliary bits per 512-bit cacheline, minimizing the embodied energy (fabrication) overhead to mitigate write disturbance. Additionally, through a multi-objective optimization, dramatic endurance improvements are possible while maintaining nearly all write disturbance improvement. Our technique improves performance, endurance and write energy by 47%, 42% and 36% versus the state-of-the-art with nominal (circa 1%) increases to embodied energy. When considering the full life-cycle impact, the additional area of our MTC with encoding approach is mitigated by the use-phase benefits within 60 days for a high performance system and in less than four years of use for a desktop system. In nearly all studied scenarios, the improved lifetime provided by our MTC and encoding approach easily recoups the required additional upfront manufacturing energy.

AB  - The elevated acetone levels in human breath could be a promising biomarker to predict diabetes non-invasively, while requiring a low concentration of target gas detection among complex respiration background gases. This research presents highly selective detection of acetone and its binary mixture in the pure air by a single SnO2-based metal oxide gas sensor. The sensor, whose sensing area was optimized by the nanometric thin lines structure to increase its surface-to-volume ratio, was combined with a 1D-convolution neural network (1D-CNN) and optimized with fragments blend and unified weights (CNN-FBUW) to identify acetone concentrations from time-series resistance noise. To explain the recognition mechanism, we have transformed the input data and trained those datasets with the same CNN architecture. Amplitude and high-frequency information of resistance fluctuation were proven essential for gas recognition. A higher sensitive device amplifies the amplitude information, benefiting deep learning algorithms to explore adsorption and desorption processes on the SnO2 layer. Acetone/ethanol binary gases’ mixtures were possibly identified with the model only trained with individual acetone gas data, which is considered a novel approach to relieving the data collection workload.

AB  - A dynamic output-feedback, robust, shared controller considering different drivers’ characteristics is proposed to assist human drivers for path tracking. The uncertain, diverse parameters for describing different drivers’ characteristics including delay time, preview time, and steering proportional gain are considered and handled by a polytope. The regional pole placement is applied in the proposed dynamic output-feedback controller to improve the stability and performance of the driver-vehicle system. A method to convert the multi-objective H∞ robust control into the single objective control is also introduced. Simulation results indicate that performance of path following for the driver-vehicle systems with different human drivers are improved with the proposed controller. Meanwhile, physical workloads of the inexperienced drivers are significantly reduced. Simulation results also show that the delay time of the driver-vehicle system can be adjusted by the pole placement, and the preview time of the driver can also be reduced to some extent with the proposed controller. Robustness of the controller is preserved against parameter variations and disturbance.

This paper reports and discusses the development of two educational expert systems at a private international university. The first expert system is a course advising system which recommends courses to undergraduate students. The second system suggests scholarships to undergraduate students based on their eligibility. While there have been reported systems for course advising, the literature does not seem to contain any references to expert systems for scholarship recommendation and eligibility checking. Therefore the scholarship recommender that we developed is first of its kind. Both systems have been implemented and tested using Oracle Policy Automation (OPA) software.

AB  - The cell process in a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) manufacturing is characterized as a complicated multi-stage and parallel-machine production system. This system has multiple products, sequence-dependent setup times, multi-step production, multi-objective, and matching constraints between color filter lines and array lines. This complex and capital-intensive production environment needs an efficient capacity planning decision that determines the order release schedule, estimated machine start and finished time of each order, and machine allocations to improve the performance of the entire production process. This research first proposes a finite capacity planning system (FCPS) to cope with the capacity planning problem faced by the TFT-LCD cell process based on the pull philosophy and assumption of finite capacity. A modified multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) embedded in FCPS is also developed to efficiently generate the order release decision, which simultaneously minimizes the machine workload balance, makespan, and lateness. The preliminary experiment identifies the fine MOGA tuning parameters using a two-level factorial experimental design. Finally, the full factorial experiment evaluates the significance and robustness of the proposed modified MOGA algorithm compared with other competitive algorithms under various circumstances.

AB  - Groups of cooperative organisms, including humans, benefit from the contributions of both specialist and generalist individuals. Group responses to resource or task demand emerge from the specific actions of individuals within the group. Bumble bee colonies need to respond to resource demands for both pollen and nectar for colony growth and reproduction. Bumble bee workers have been shown to display differences in foraging preferences for these essential resources and in activity level. This study investigated the responses of Bombus terrestris individuals to resource demand by subjecting colonies to different pollen and sucrose storage scenarios, considering their individual foraging preferences and activity levels. The sucrose sensitivity and olfactory learning ability of individuals were then compared along a spectrum of foraging preference (between pollen and sucrose foraging) using the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. When sucrose was in demand, individuals with a preference for sucrose showed the largest upregulation in foraging bouts. Individual preference for pollen and activity level correlated with the upregulation of foraging bouts when pollen was in demand. This study detected no relationship between body size, sucrose preference and worker sucrose sensitivity or olfactory learning ability, tested with proboscis extension reflex conditioning. This study highlights the potential value of foraging preferences in bumble bee colonies but also the flexibility these colonies have with a small foraging workforce.

AB  - Objective
Seizure type classification is important as therapy differs for different epilepsy subtypes.Currently, skilled neurologists classifyseizuresbased on visual analysis. However, manual EEG inspection is time-consuming, laborious,subjective, and prone to misclassification due to artifacts andEEGvariability. This work aims to address these limitations.
Methods
In this work, a quick, robust, and accurate spatiotemporal analytical algorithm is developed to classify epileptic seizures.TheEEG dataset is sampled at 125 Hz using aNicolet EEG system.Robust preprocessing, feature extraction, andoptimal classifiers captured IEDs (Interictal Epileptiform Discharges), includingspikes, sharps, slowwaves, and Spike-Wave Discharges (SWD).
Results
The developed classifier resultsarevalidated againstclinicalimpressionsprovided by experienced epileptologists. Thealgorithm automatically classifies the EEG datainto four types: normal, focal, generalized, and absence, with 93.18 % accuracy (n = 88).
Conclusion
Theresultssuggest a novel way toscreen epileptic subjects without false positives (accuracy: 94.32 %, n = 88) and tentatively identify the seizure type. Blind validation further confirms the generalizability of the classifier (accuracy: 90.90 %, n = 11).
Significance
The developed algorithm reduces the workload of neurologists for epilepsy screening and identifies seizure onset zone, temporal spread, and overall scalp distribution of epileptic activities.
