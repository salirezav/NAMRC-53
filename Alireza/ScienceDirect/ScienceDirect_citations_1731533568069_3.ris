AB  - Due to the unstructured, fast-changing environment of construction sites, robots require human assistance to perform various tasks, especially those involving high dexterity and nuanced human judgment. However, in shared physical spaces, human-robot collaboration (HRC) can raise new safety concerns as workers' mental health can be adversely affected by poor communication between the two peers. To create a harmonized, safe HRC, this study proposes a worker-centered collaborative framework that enables robots to capture workers' brainwaves from wearable electroencephalograph, evaluate their task-related cognitive load, and adjust the robotic performance accordingly. The framework was examined by asking 14 subjects to execute a collaborative construction task with a terrestrial robot under various levels of cognitive loads. The results showed the robot could regulate its working pace with 81.91% accuracy. This level of communication can instill trust in HRC and facilitate future endeavors in safety design of collaborative robotics.

AB  - Adopting additive manufacturing (AM) in product design is limited by the shortage of skilled designers with design for AM (DfAM) expertise. This lack of AM talent is a major hurdle for organizations looking for innovative solutions to solve emerging engineering problems. Developing institutional talent in DfAM and AM process knowledge is of paramount importance to support organizations looking to leverage AM. Therefore, future designers need meaningful experiences to acquire DfAM intuition and AM process competency to enable informed artifact generation during the design process. This necessitates supplying active experiences that highlight the advantages and limitations of AM technologies and promote DfAM intuition. However, limited access to in-person experiences with physical AM systems inhibits designers from gaining such intuition. Digital modalities of AM education, such as computer-aided (CAx) and virtual reality (VR) tools, can alternatively provide access to experiential learning to cultivate this AM expertise. Where CAx experiences are typically associated with non-immersive modalities, VR experiences can offer enhanced immersion to replicate in-person experiences. There is a gap in the literature, however, that investigates immersive and non-immersive modalities on their effectiveness in training and artifact generation for AM. Additionally, there is a scarcity of information on design guides for creating immersive experiences that can support these research endeavors. It is essential to establish guidance on designing immersive experiences that offer meaningful and active engagement with AM technologies. Such guidance will support the development of experiences that cultivate DfAM intuition, AM process competency, and problem-solving skills. This research is thus motivated to explore the design of immersive VR experiences for problem-solving and artifact generation with AM. For this purpose, this work presents a generalized framework to inform the design of such experiences along with an example created using the proposed framework.

AB  - The use of multiple cooperating industrial robots provides efficient and flexible solutions to the manufacturing of complex aerospace structures. Such applications require the workloads to be sufficiently shared between neighboring robots, this entails the collision-free scheduling of many discrete tasks, where precedence orders need to be assigned for specific tasks. In this paper, we first present a two-step task allocation method that handles workload balancing, then a scheduling algorithm combining construction heuristic with iterated local search to provide efficient schedules. Our key innovation is a collision model that encodes precedence constraints and a fast heuristic that constructs collision-free schedule under given constraints, the optimization of the schedule is then addressed by an iterated local search. The advantage in terms of minimizing makespan under different problem scales and conditions is validated by computational experiments. Finally, the use of our method is demonstrated by a physical multi-robot system.

AB  - Industry 5.0 aims to prioritize human operators, focusing on their well-being and capabilities, while promoting collaboration between humans and robots to enhance efficiency and productivity. The integration of collaborative robots must ensure the health and well-being of human operators. Indeed, this paper addresses the need for a human-centered framework proposing a preference-based optimization algorithm in a human–robot collaboration (HRC) scenario with an ergonomics assessment to improve working conditions. The HRC application consists of optimizing a collaborative robot end-effector pose during an object-handling task. The following approach (AmPL-RULA) utilizes an Active multi-Preference Learning (AmPL) algorithm, a preference-based optimization method, where the user is requested to iteratively provide qualitative feedback by expressing pairwise preferences between a couple of candidates. To address physical well-being, an ergonomic performance index, Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), is combined with the user’s pairwise preferences, so that the optimal setting can be computed. Experimental tests have been conducted to validate the method, involving collaborative assembly during the object handling performed by the robot. Results illustrate that the proposed method can improve the physical workload of the operator while easing the collaborative task.

AB  - Although the concept of industrial cobots dates back to 1999, most present day hybrid human–machine assembly systems are merely weight compensators. Here, we present results on the development of a collaborative human–robot manufacturing cell for homokinetic joint assembly. The robot alternates active and passive behaviours during assembly, to lighten the burden on the operator in the first case, and to comply to his/her needs in the latter. Our approach can successfully manage direct physical contact between robot and human, and between robot and environment. Furthermore, it can be applied to standard position (and not torque) controlled robots, common in the industry. The approach is validated in a series of assembly experiments. The human workload is reduced, diminishing the risk of strain injuries. Besides, a complete risk analysis indicates that the proposed setup is compatible with the safety standards, and could be certified.

AB  - In order to complete the intelligent assembly operation, the cooperation between assembly robotic arm and assembly sequence planning (ASP) is necessary. This is a matter of great importance, as traditional product assembly incurs considerable manpower and time, generally accounting for 20–70% of the total manufacturing workload. In this paper, we develop a dual-projected-based automated interference matrix (DPIM) algorithm that analyzes the relations between the components of a given product. In order to reduce the number of times that collide detection is performed in comparison with the method only do collision detection, the DPIM algorithm relies on static interference detection and dual-projected detection to generate a contact matrix, a direction contact matrix, and an interference matrix. By reducing the number of times collide detection is performed, DPIM can reduce the workload of assembly, thereby reducing the total manufacturing load overall and the manufacturing time likewise.

Although human-robot collaboration allows to relieve operators of exhausting works, an effective collaboration requires a straightforward interaction to foster the use of robot assistants. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on human-robot interaction approaches and related interfaces addressed to robot programming. An overview of on-line and off-line robot programming techniques is first presented. Then, novel intuitive interaction means, such as those based on multi-modal interaction, virtual and augmented reality, are considered. The paper aims at pointing out that collaborative robotics can effectively reduce operator’s physical workload if easy to use interfaces for robot programming are provided.

AB  - To improve the efficiency and viability of healthcare organizations, it is crucial to enhance both the quality of patient care and the well-being of healthcare staff, particularly nurses. They play a vital role as a key human resource in healthcare, and their well-being and job satisfaction are significantly influenced by effective scheduling. Improved scheduling practices not only enhance the quality of care provided but also contribute to better job satisfaction and overall well-being of the nursing staff. Despite the importance of this task, nurse scheduling is often conducted manually by head nurses, which is both challenging and time-consuming. This study proposes a mathematical model that addresses the nurse scheduling problem, with a specific application in a French hospital department. The objectives of the model are to accommodate a wide range of constraints flexibly, ensure balanced workloads and shifts, and align with the preferences of the nursing staff. A significant contribution of this research is the theoretical investigation and comparison of various workload balancing criteria tailored to the specific context of the problem. The study analyzes different workload balancing criteria to formulate an efficient scheduling solution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through large experiments and practice feedback, confirming its potential to enhance both healthcare efficiency and nurses’ well-being.

AB  - Information visualizations may be evaluated from the perspective of how they match tasks that must be performed with them, a cognitive fit perspective. However, there is a gap between the high-level references made to cognitive fit and the low-level ability to identify and measure it during human interaction with visualizations. We bridge this gap by using an electroencephalography metric derived from frontal midline theta power and parietal alpha power, known as the task load index, to determine if cognitive effort measured at the level of cortical activity is less when cognitive fit is present compared to when cognitive fit is not. We found that when there is cognitive fit between the type of problem to be solved and the information displayed by a system, the task load index is lower compared to when cognitive fit is not present. We support this finding with subjective (NASA task load index) and performance (response time and accuracy) measures. Our approach, using electroencephalography, provides supplemental information to self-report and performance measures. Findings from this study are important because they (1) provide more validity to the cognitive fit theory using a neurophysiological measure, and (2) use the electroencephalography task load index metric as a means to assess cognitive workload and effort in general.

AB  - Human use of marijuana at an early age has been reported to lead to cognitive impairment. However, researchers have not yet clearly determined whether this impairment is due to marijuana-induced alterations in the developing nervous system and whether this deficit persists into adulthood after marijuana use has ceased. We administered anandamide to developing rats to assess the effect of cannabinoids on development. We subsequently evaluated learning and performance on a temporal bisection task in adulthood and assessed the expression of genes encoding principal subunits of NMDA receptors (Grin1, Grin2A, and Grin2B) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Rats in two age groups, namely, 21-day-old and 150-day-old rats, received intraperitoneal injections of anandamide or the vehicle for 14 days. Both groups performed a temporal bisection test, which included listening to tones of different durations and classifying them as short or long. The expression of the Grin1, Grin2A and Grin2B mRNAs was evaluated using quantitative PCR in both age groups after extracting mRNA from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We observed a learning impairment in the temporal bisection task (p < 0.05) and changes in the response latency (p < 0.05) in rats that received anandamide. Furthermore, these rats exhibited decreased expression of Grin2b (p = 0.001) compared to those that received the vehicle. In human subjects, the use of cannabinoids during development induces a long-term deficit, but this deficit is not observed in subjects who use cannabinoids in adulthood. Rats treated with anandamide earlier in development took longer to learn the task, suggesting that anandamide exerts a harmful effect on cognition in developing rats. Administration of anandamide during early stages of development induced deficits in learning and other cognitive processes that depend on an adequate estimation of time. The cognitive demands of the environment must be considered when evaluating the cognitive effects of cannabinoids on developing or mature brains. High cognitive demands might induce differential expression of NMDA receptors that improves cognitive capacity, overcoming altered glutamatergic function

AB  - Over the years, advancement in automation technology is allowed the increased integration of humans and machines in a manufacturing environment, these days fewer humans. The use of Knowledge-based Systems in improving and converting human overall performance has been restrained in truth because of a lack of expertise of the way an individual’s overall performance deteriorates with fatigue buildup, which may range from employees to the work environment. As a result, the performance benefits of increased automation in a manufacturing environment, as well as the impact of human factors, must be taken into account. To predict fatigue in physically demanding tasks, this study takes a data-driven strategy. The influence of demographic characteristics, their physical fatigue states, detected workloads, and reactivity to physiological changes are investigated through sensors (Inertial Measurement Unit; IMU and Heart Rate Variability; HRV) in this paper. A framework is established for the selection of key features, machine learning algorithms, and evaluating subjective measures. To attain that, specific application scenarios of the framework are shown, each for different sorts of manufacturing-related tasks.

Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) can provide both the conceptual framework and literal description of the underlying complexity dynamics associated with human cognition, specifically during information processing of the brain under the effect of an external stimuli.
Proposed Method
To study the complexity changes during cognitive loading of the brain using Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) and Sample Entropy (SampEn) as a multiparametric signature of cognitive processing. The proposed methodology demonstrates joint Time-Space representation of the various Brain Rhythms under four different classes of Cognitive Tasks (Emotion, Focus, Memory and Problem Solving) given to four subjects. The raw EEG signal is acquired using a 19 channel EEG machine, denoised using Wavelet packet decomposition technique. Brain waves are extracted using the scalogram plot. The parameters are calculated for each channel over a 2 min analysis window sliding through the whole length.
Results
These parameters were able to classify between different cognitive states, such as Emotion, Focus, Memory and Problem Solving with an accuracy of 99%.
Comparison of Existing Method
Previous works haven’t addressed complexity changes during cognitive processing using DST. Earlier studies explain average topographical map of the brain for a fixed time window where as, we have presented the topographical map over a customizable fixed time sliding window.
Conclusion
The cubic representation of the brain map containing non-linear parameters can prove to be a significant visualization tool for monitoring effects of cognitive loading using DST proponents as biomarker.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) has increasingly been applied to benefit manual assembly tasks by conveying the paper-based instructions into visual guidance intuitively, alleviating the cognitive load while improving assembly efficiency. Nevertheless, most current AR assemblies focus on spatial alignment by superimposing a 3D virtual model on the real scene directly, ignoring the occlusion awareness between virtual guidance and the real scene. To this end, we proposed a bare-hand occlusion-aware interactive AR assembly method based on the monocular image, and a lightweight deep neural network is established to infer the depth relationship between the 3D virtual model and real scene including gesture manipulation, and thus the ambiguous AR instruction by inaccurate occlusion deduction would be prevented, leading to more realistic bare-hand interactive AR guidance for manual assembly. And then, a quantitative evaluation criterion is established to illustrate the gesture occlusion awareness performance during manual assembly operations. Finally, comprehensive experiments are carried out and the results illustrate that the bare-hand occlusion-aware system can alleviate the cognitive load for the operators within interactive AR assembly tasks, providing a more human-center intelligent assembly application.

AB  - Trustworthiness and product traceability are essential factors in the apparel industry 4.0 for establishing successful business relationships among stakeholders such as customers, manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has implemented different technology-based systems to record and track product transactions. However, these systems work in silos, and there is no intra-system communication, leading to a lack of complete supply chain traceability for all apparel stakeholders. Moreover, apparel stakeholders are reluctant to share their business information with business competitors; thus, they involve third-party auditors to ensure the quality of the final product. Furthermore, the apparel manufacturing industry faces challenges with counterfeit products, making it difficult for consumers to determine the authenticity of the products. Therefore, in this paper, a trustworthy apparel product traceability framework called ChainApparel is developed using the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain to address these challenges of authenticity and traceability of apparel products. Specifically, multiple smart contracts are designed and developed for registration, process execution, audit, fault, and product traceability to authorize, validate, and trace every business transaction among the apparel stakeholders. Further, the real-time performance analysis of ChainApparel is carried out regarding transaction throughput and latency by deploying the compute nodes at different geographical locations using Hyperledger Fabric. The results conclude that ChainApparel accomplished significant performance under diverse workloads while ensuring complete traceability along the complex supply chain of the apparel industry. Thus, the ChainApparel framework helps make the apparel product more trustworthy and transparent in the market while safeguarding trust among the industry stakeholders.

AB  - Learning from mutually referring but spatially separated text and picture (i.e., split-attention materials) is cognitively demanding. We investigated whether mouse pointing could support learning from split-attention materials in which the related elements between the text and picture were indicated by visual labels or not. One hundred thirty-two university students studied a text and picture about the human nervous system in one cell of a 2 (Mouse Pointing: yes vs. no) × 2 (Labeling: yes vs. no) between-subjects design. Results indicated neither mouse pointing nor labeling had a significant impact on retention, comprehension, and cognitive load ratings. However, there was an interaction between mouse pointing and labeling on comprehension scores, indicating that mouse pointing on labeled materials resulted in worse performance than mouse pointing on unlabeled materials. Eye tracking results revealed that both mouse pointing and labeling led to shorter fixation durations and less fixations on the text and more transitions between text and picture. Labeling also led to longer fixation durations and more fixations on the picture. These findings suggest that mouse pointing and labeling influenced perceptual but not cognitive processing.

AB  - The poor absolute positioning accuracy of industrial robots has limited their application in fields such as aerospace manufacturing. To address this issue, the spatial grid compensation method has been proposed as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose a sampling method based on three-dimensional discrete point space circular fitting for grid points to significantly reduce the sampling workload and improve compensation accuracy compared to traditional joint space grid compensation methods. Additionally, we use the Kriging interpolation algorithm instead of the inverse distance weighting (IDW) algorithm for spatial interpolation prediction of pose error. Based on this, the proposed sampling and interpolation prediction method in this paper was verified on a Comau NJ500–2.7 manipulator equipped with a fiber-laying end effector. The experimental results demonstrate that using our proposed sampling method yields pose data of grid points that have only a small deviation from directly sampled results and are only slightly higher than the robot's repeat positioning accuracy. Moreover, our proposed method can significantly reduce the sampling workload by 60% under the experimental conditions of this study (sampling 10 groups of data within 90 degrees range), with increasing sampling range leading to more obvious efficiency improvements. Finally, we show that compared to the IDW algorithm, the Kriging interpolation algorithm yields better results and improves the mean absolute positioning accuracy of robots after compensation by 30%.

AB  - Effective machine maintenance and job scheduling strategies are two critical interactive tasks to upgrade the production efficiency in manufacturing industries. In this study, we mainly consider the interaction between production scheduling and maintenance, while optimizing the job scheduling problem in a serial–parallel hybrid two-stage production system. We formulate the problem by introducing the stochastic and workload-ratio degradation, and the actual job completion time and maintenance costs can be modeled according to the degradation status of each machine. To solve this problem, a two-step opportunistic maintenance (OM) strategy is developed, and finally an adaptive random-key genetic algorithm (GA) is designed by incorporating the OM coefficients. Numerical studies have been conducted to validate the proposed approach, and the results indicate the effectiveness compared to three existing methods under varying machine degradation scenarios.

AB  - It is crucial to investigate the effects of indoor thermal environmental conditions on human performance, especially in India, during the winter when there is a significant need for space heating to maintain human comfort conditions. The present study was conducted in a controlled climate during winter, with 96 participants exposed to four air temperatures: 15 °C, 18 °C, 21 °C, and 24 °C. Participant's thermal comfort, emotion, and self-rated workload were assessed using a subjective questionnaire, while their performance was quantitatively evaluated using a neurobehavioral test. The data was analyzed to establish how the various thermal environmental factors influence performance, workload, emotion, and thermal sensations. The results show that the highest performance within the experimental thermal environmental conditions was observed when the thermal sensation ranges from neutral to slightly warm (+0.20) at the 23.5 °C mean standard effective temperature. At the same sensation, the occupant's mood disturbance and the mental workload for completing the task were minimal. These results would be helpful for facility managers of buildings by giving them insight into the impact of under or over-heating spaces on occupant performance during winter in the composite climate of India.

AB  - Practical planning and decision-making problems are often better and more accurately formulated with multiple conflicting objectives rather than a single objective. This study investigates a situation relevant for Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) as well as Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO), where the decision-maker needs to make a series of choices between nondominated options characterized by multiple objectives. The cognitive capacity of humans is limited, which leads to cognitive burden that influences human decision-makers’ decisions. We measure how the varying number of objectives influences cognitive burden in a laboratory study, and the impacts that this burden has on the decision-makers’ behavior and the consistency of their decisions. We use psychophysiological, behavioral, and self-report methods. Our results suggest that a higher number of objectives (i) increases cognitive burden significantly, (ii) leads to adopting strategies in which only a limited number of objectives is considered, and (iii) decreases decision consistency.

AB  - With the recent advancements in sensing technologies, mechatronics, and artificial intelligence, collaborative robots are deployed on construction sites to assist workers in performing physically demanding tasks. However, the human–robot collaboration (HRC) can bring several occupational challenges to workers, ranging from physical collisions to adverse psychological impacts. To date, most of the literature on HRC has focused on addressing physical safety challenges, while very few have considered the psychological safety of the workers. To bridge this gap, by integrating generative adversarial network, autoencoder, machine learning, and robot adaptation techniques, this study proposes a novel physiological computing system that enables the collaborative robot to efficiently perceive workers’ psychological states and regulate its performance seamlessly. The results showed that the proposed system allowed the robot to adjust its performance as per workers’ cognitive load level with 89.6% accuracy. The findings revealed the potential of the proposed system in facilitating safe HRC in construction.

AB  - Complete and accurate data is an important enabler of effective supply chain decision making. Despite the increasing efforts to fully automate data collection processes using advanced sensors and scanners, human operators are still in charge of data entry tasks in most industries. Unfortunately, operators do not often comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and do not always exhibit the consistency and commitment required to collect high-quality data. In fact, data collection is often perceived as a non-value-adding activity that increases workloads and lowers productivity. We aim to empirically study the extent to which compliance with SOPs for data collection is affected by some of the key factors. Using a large dataset obtained from a leading postal service provider in Australia, we find that an operator’s workload, fatigue, and related work experience directly impact the compliance levels. We also find that a company’s compliance reinforcement intervention to improve compliance behavior can moderate these impacts.

AB  - Air traffic control (ATC) is a safety-critical service system that demands constant attention from ground air traffic controllers (ATCos) to maintain daily aviation operations. The workload of the ATCos can have negative effects on operational safety and airspace usage. To avoid overloading and ensure an acceptable workload level for the ATCos, it is important to predict the ATCos’ workload accurately for mitigation actions. In this paper, we first perform a review of research on ATCo workload, mostly from the air traffic perspective. Then, we briefly introduce the setup of the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with retired ATCos, where the air traffic data and workload labels are obtained. The simulations are conducted under three Phoenix approach scenarios while the human ATCos are requested to self-evaluate their workload ratings (i.e., low-1 to high-7). Preliminary data analysis is conducted. Next, we propose a graph-based deep-learning framework with conformal prediction to identify the ATCo workload levels. The number of aircraft under the controller’s control varies both spatially and temporally, resulting in dynamically evolving graphs. The experiment results suggest that (a) besides the traffic density feature, the traffic conflict feature contributes to the workload prediction capabilities (i.e., minimum horizontal/vertical separation distance); (b) directly learning from the spatiotemporal graph layout of airspace with graph neural network can achieve higher prediction accuracy, compare to hand-crafted traffic complexity features; (c) conformal prediction is a valuable tool to further boost model prediction accuracy, resulting a range of predicted workload labels. The code used is available at Link.

Questionnaire study, postural assessment tools, computer aided design, digital human modeling and simulation, and basic work study techniques were used. Plastic processing industry is highly fragmented, consisting of small, medium scale enterprises with tremendous growth potential. Occupational design ergonomics research in the injection molding plastic furniture manufacturing shop-floor workstations is very scarce in industrially developing countries. Shop-floor workers are affected by prevalent awkward working postures and consequent body part discomforts. Useful and easily implementable accessories/fixtures with convenient design features were conceptualized. Virtual ergonomics evaluation of the workstation with proposed accessories/fixtures showed significant reduction of awkward working postures. Physical prototypes of the proposed fixtures were constructed and real human trials were performed in the factories. Time study indicated reduction in operator cycle time when compared with time taken before design modifications. Research methodology, results and design solutions described from an ergonomics perspective would definitely serve as a helpful guide for existing as well as upcoming factories in the injection molded plastic furniture manufacturing industry of industrially developing countries and further similar research endeavors.

AB  - Decoding eye movements from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) data is a challenging yet vital task for both scientific and practical purposes, especially for identifying neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our research tackles this complexity by adapting inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a machine learning method, to infer decision-making strategies from observed behaviors. We implement this to understand the processes driving eye direction and movements during diverse cognitive tasks, providing new insights into this field. Our paper begins with a detailed description of the procedures for collecting and preprocessing EEG data related to gaze behavior. We then elaborate on the development of an IRL framework designed to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of eye movements (scanpaths) in participants engaged in cognitive tasks of varying complexity. Our model is tailored to accommodate the complexities inherent in neural signals and the stochastic nature of human gaze patterns. Our research findings underscore IRL’s effectiveness in precisely forecasting gaze patterns based on a combination of EEG and image data. The correlation between the model’s predictions and the actual gaze behavior observed in controlled experiments reinforces the utility of IRL in cognitive neuroscience research. Notably, our IRL-EEG models demonstrated superior performance, especially in more complex cognitive tasks. We further delve into the implications of our results for enhancing the understanding of neural mechanisms that govern gaze behavior.

AB  - Amidst the escalating demand for sustainable manufacturing practices aimed at mitigating global emissions and waste, industries are actively seeking novel forming solutions to address these pressing global challenges. Near Solidus Forming (NSF) processes emerge as a promising alternative to confront such issues, offering the capability to fabricate intricate components reliably while minimizing material waste and energy consumption. This promising manufacturing process is still in its developmental stages for industrial applications, necessitating further exploration and understanding of various factors such as friction, heat transfer, and others. From the literature review, a lack of friction data at these temperatures has been identified. Therefore, this study is dedicated to the advanced characterization of the friction coefficient for Near Solidus Forging (NSF) operations. With that aim, T-shape experimental tests of 42CrMo4 alloy steel have been conducted at high temperatures (up to 1360 °C). Additionally, a lack of consensus on the correct T-shape testing and inverse analysis procedure has been noted. Consequently, apart from the experimental work, an in-depth analysis of the friction coefficient identification procedure has been conducted. As a result, a new geometrical output index is proposed, highly sensitive to the friction coefficient and therefore more reliable compared to state-of-the-art indexes. Furthermore, the influence of the selected geometrical output index and the consideration of sample-to-sample transfer and holding times were studied. Results showed that the increase in workload to consider the sample-to-sample transfer and holding times is not worthwhile, as assuming the average values lead to significantly less work with little impact in the final results (<5 % of error). The study also concludes that a friction coefficient of 0.25, 0.45 and 0.6 has been identified at temperatures of 1250 °C, 1300 °C and 1360 °C, respectively. Additionally, the result of thermal camera showed good agreement with the thermocouple data. Overall, in this study a robust and reliable T-shape testing, and friction coefficient identification procedure is proposed and validated.

AB  - This article presents a participatory intervention in a furniture manufacturing company in Southern Brazil aiming to improve both ergonomic and production outcomes. The existing Tayloristic model was replaced by a cellular teamwork model. Work enlargement and enrichment, and the improvements in workstation design and process flow increased worker satisfaction and reduced postural risk, fatigue, body pain and production waste. Workload was reduced by 42% and productivity increased by 46% (25% being attributable to unnecessary load handling, waiting and transportation, and 21% attributable directly to manufacturing times). Workers' participation in the stages of problems identification, design and evaluation of solutions played a major role in these outcomes.
Relevance to industry
This study indicates that it is possible to balance ergonomics and production demands, and that it is necessary to make it clear to management. The integration of macroergonomics and production management principles increases both worker well-being and productivity levels, thus leading to a more sustainable system.

Several frameworks and surveys have been proposed to provide guidelines, managerial insights, limitations and future research perspectives on this emerging topic. However, just a few works focus the attention on DT and its role in quantifying, evaluating and providing ergonomics, mental or physical workload, posture feedback or warnings to workers, aiming to improve their safety conditions. For this reason, this study investigates the current state of the art about the DT and its application as a tool to evaluate and integrate ergonomic aspects, or additional human factors, in M&L systems.

AB  - Typically, in standardised tests, girls underperform boys in mathematics while boys underperform girls in reading. Can these educational inequalities be driven by specific testing practices? This study addresses this question by innovatively using data from the largest worldwide standardized test and exploiting the random variation in the format of the tests assigned to students. I find that there is a noticeable widening of the gender gap when a larger share of questions is multiple-choice, rather than filling-the-gap questions. A 10 percentage point increase in the share of multiple-choice questions inflates female under-performance in mathematics by 0.025 standard deviations and male under-performance in reading by 0.035 standard deviations. This accounts for nearly one-quarter of the overall gender disparity found in these subjects. I provide suggestive evidence that ruling out alternative options, rather than coming up with an entire answer, may contribute to cognitive information overload among students with lower confidence levels (generally girls in mathematics and boys in reading). These cognitive loads, in turn, have implications for a student's future level of effort and performance.

AB  - Cloud computing is a thriving and ever-expanding sector in the industry world. This growth has sparked increased interest from organizations seeking to harness its potential. However, the sheer volume of services and offerings in this field has resulted in a noticeable surge in related data. With the rapid evolution and growing demand, cloud computing resource management faces a fresh set of challenges. Resource limitations, such as high maintenance costs, elevated Energy Consumption (EC), and adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLA), are critical concerns for both the cloud computing industry and its user organizations. In this context, taking a proactive approach to resource management and Virtual Machine Consolidation (VMC) has become imperative. The logical management of resources and the consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) in a manner that aligns with the requirements and demands of service providers and users have garnered widespread attention. The goal of this proposed paper is to focus on addressing the VMC problem within a unified framework, divided into two main phases. The first phase deals with host workload detection and prediction, while the subsequent phase tackles the selection and allocation of appropriate VMs. In our proposed method, for the first time, we use a Granular Computing (GRC) model, which is an efficient, scalable, and human-centric computational approach. This model exhibits behaviors similar to intelligent human decision-making, as it can simultaneously consider all factors and criteria involved in the problems. We evaluated our proposed method through simulations using CloudSim on various types of workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in all measurement metrics.

AB  - Virtual reality-based experiments were conducted to assess the impacts of environmental pollutants (i.e., noise, vibration, and dust) on work performance. In these experiments, concrete chipping work was performed in eight different exposure environments based on exposure to three environmental pollutants to measure data related to work performance: (i) work performance metrics, including work duration and accuracy; and (ii) mental workload. The relationships between data related to work performance and environmental pollutants were then analyzed using statistical techniques as follows: First, work duration was statistically significantly affected by dust, while work accuracy was significantly affected by vibration. Second, mental workload was statistically significantly affected by all three environmental pollutants, increasing with the number of environmental pollutants the workers exposed to. Third, all data related to work performance were found to be correlated with each other. These findings provide insights into improving work performance by managing environmental pollutants in the construction industry.

AB  - Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive tool for monitoring functional brain activation that records changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) concentrations. fNIRS is well accepted in the cognitive study where the signals are intended to measure cognitive load in the human brain. Concentration changes in HbO and HbR help in classifying the cognitive states of human brain. There are several machine learning classification techniques to distinguish different cognitive states. Some conventional machine learning methods, which are easier to implement, undergo a complex processing phase before training the network and also suffer from low accuracy due to inappropriate data preprocessing. Deep learning based convolutional neural network (CNN) having automatic feature engineering capability plays a very important role in efficiently classifying different cognitive states. The present work uses two open-access datasets on fNIRS signal. The datasets are taken for two cognitive states: mental task (MT) and resting state or baseline task (BL). The concentration changes of HbO and HbR are computed using the modified Beer–Lambert law. The band-pass filter is used to remove additional noise from the signals. Here, topographical brain images are generated from the data of 2 s window with 1 s overlapping for both HbO and HbR. Global normalization is applied to the filtered data for better visualization of the images. The brain images are fed to the proposed CNN model in order to classify them into MT or BL. The accuracy of the classification and the comparative study shows the superiority of the proposed model over two existing models.

AB  - Today, globalized markets require more resilient and agile manufacturing systems, as well as customized and virtualized features. Classical self-standing manufacturing systems are evolving into collaborative networks such as Cloud Manufacturing (based on centralized knowledge and distributed resources) or Shared Manufacturing (based on fully decentralized knowledge and distributed resources) as a solution to ensure business continuity under normal as well as special circumstances. Additive Manufacturing (AM), one of the enablers of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is a promising technology for innovative production models due to its inherent distributed capabilities, digital nature, and product customization ability. To increase the adaptivity of distributed resources using AM technology, this paper proposes a mechanism for sharing workload and resources under unexpected behaviours in the supply chain. Smart contracts and blockchain technology in this concept are used to provide decentralized, transparent, and trusted operation of such systems, which provide more resilience to disruptive factors. In this paper, the proposed Blockchain-based Shared Additive Manufacturing (BBSAM) protocol, ontology, and workflow for AM capacity pooling are discussed and analysed under special conditions such as anomalous demand. Discrete-time Python simulation on a real Italian AM market dataset, also provided, is available on GitHub.

AB  - Valve leakage is a serious safety issue in petroleum and petrochemical production processes. Traditional valve manufacturers examine valve leakage by manual visual inspection, but this method is inefficient and prone to errors. Hence, this paper applies machine vision techniques to develop a measurement method that can detect valve leakage according to the global standards of the petroleum industry, such as those recommended by the American Petroleum Institute. A collection device and machine vision techniques were applied to count leaked bubbles. The results were then compared with traditional human visual counting. The proposed machine vision method can achieve a mean absolute error of less than 1% while also reducing two-thirds of the workload of traditional human visual counting. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of this method. This study is the first to adapt machine-vision technology to industrial valve leakage measurement and opens up new possibilities for further exploration of valve leakage.

AB  - Sustainable Manufacturing (SM) traditionally focused on optimization of environmental and economic aspects, by neglecting the human performance. However, the industrial plant's costs, productivity and process quality highly depend on the individual human performance (e.g., comfort perceived, physical and mental workload, simplicity of actions, personal satisfaction) and how much hazardous positions and uncomfortable tasks finally cost to the company. The present paper defines a human-centred virtual simulation environment to optimize physical ergonomics in workstation design and demonstrates its benefits on an industrial case study in pipe industry. The proposed environment aims at overcoming traditional approaches, where analysis are carried out at the shop-floor when the plant is already created, by providing a virtual environment to easily test and verify different design solutions to optimize physical, cognitive and organizational ergonomics.

AB  - In the field of aircraft system engineering, this research work aims to bridge the gap between conceptual design and quantitative analysis, with a specific focus on the installation of aircraft passenger seats. To achieve this objective, a comprehensive analysis of seat installation process for commercial aircraft was carried out to identify and describe criticalities associated with this manufacturing phase. Different means were used to gather information, starting from the analysis of technical documents, and conducting interviews with industry experts. The research methodology employs a unique translation mechanism, harnessing the power of scoring matrices which are based on a graduated scale ranging from 1 (best option) to 5 (worst option). The scoring matrix serves as a tool for quantifying and translating the qualitative data gathered from the experts into quantitative analysis reflecting the installation process workload. By quantifying the qualitative information provided by the experts, this approach enables a systematic evaluation of seat installation and aids in decision-making within the aircraft assembly domain. In essence, this research contributes a structured and rigorous framework for assessing the ease of installing aircraft components, with a specific emphasis on seats, resulting in an improved assembly process of aircraft.

AB  - Research has shown that humans have a preference for images of nature over images of built environments, and that eye-movement behaviour and attention are significantly different across these categories. To build on these findings, we investigated the influence of low-level visual properties on scene preference, cognitive load, and eye-movements. In the present study, participants viewed a mixture of unaltered and altered photographs of nature and urban scenes to determine if low-level visual properties influenced responses to scenes. Altered versions included photographs with only low or mid-to-high visual spatial frequency information, and photographs where the phase or amplitude of visual spatial frequencies had been scrambled. We replicated past findings, demonstrating preference and longer fixation-time for nature scenes versus urban cities. We then demonstrated that the visual spatial frequencies and power spectra contained in images significantly influenced preference, cognitive load, and eye-movements, and can partially explain the restoration response to natural environments.

AB  - Information systems (IS) play an important role in successful execution of organizational decisions, and the ensuing tasks that rely on those decisions. Because decision making models show that cognitive load has a significant impact on how people use information systems, objective measurement of cognitive load becomes both relevant and important in IS research. In this paper, we manipulate task demand during a decision making task in four different ways. We then investigate how increasing task demand affects a user's pupil data during interaction with a computerized decision aid. Our results suggest that pupillometry has the potential to serve as a reliable, objective, continuous and unobtrusive measure of task demand and that the adaptive decision making theory may serve as a suitable framework for studying user pupillary responses in the IS domain.

AB  - For teloperated unmanned vehicles, mishaps tend to occur during the periods of high workload, in situations where the operator must perform complex and stressful tasks. However, with many tasks performed simultaneously with flying, the relevant information is typically dispersed on a number of screens overloading the operator's visual channel. In order to address these unique human-factors problems associated with unmanned vehicles we suggest the use of an auditory display as a mean to reduce visual workload, to enhance situation awareness, and mitigate the visual and cognitive demands of contemporary marine teleoperations. Experiments were performed on the remotely operated surface marine platform (PlaDyPos) developed at the Laboratory for Underwater Systems and Technologies, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb. The results show that the concept, guidance-by-sound is feasible in the real environment. The results are in line with previously obtained results from the real-time simulator showing that tracking quality can be further improved introducing supernormal auditory cues in order to provide better-than-normal operator's auditory resolution in the frontal region. We conclude that the use of hearing in the form of the auditory display emerges as an important advantage. Since practice has a major effect on performance, there is definitely more room for improvement in using interfaces we are not trained for.

AB  - Self-directed learning (SDL) is a rapidly developing trend in schools, although its prerequisites, such as children’s skills and abilities to plan and monitor their own learning, have not been investigated in detail. Due to additional cognitive load it induces, SDL has been in some cases found to be detrimental for learning, especially for students with a lower cognitive capacity. With this study, we explored some of the causes for the variability in learning gains. We examined 111 middle school students' self-directed category learning using an exploratory web-task for autonomous learning, focusing on their information search (browsing a taxonomy of unknown dinosaurs) and their memorization of respective category labels. We were interested to detect whether students’ performance in a complex span task (Ospan) was also reflected in their search and learning behavior. Results revealed different learning gain trajectories in the latter task, where higher WMC students were more confident about their learning. Also, the students with lower WMC were found to search the taxonomy by repeatedly searching the same (basic type of) dinosaur exemplar. In line with prior findings about human mental capacity restrictions and cognitive load theory, the present work evidenced the important role of students’ resistance to distraction, and its relation to differences in self-directed search and memorizing. The results imply the need to teach metacognitive skills and offer supportive scaffolding in order to avoid cognitive overload in SDL.

AB  - In the last few decades, studies have demonstrated the correlation between worker well-being and the performance of production systems. This paper addresses the problem of assigning workers to tasks in a workshop system. In this context, recent researches have focused on the ergonomics assessment, often neglecting the evaluation of the workers’ performance. This study aims to formulate a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the workforce scheduling problem and improve the performance of the system integrating ergonomics and human skills. To overcome the complexity of the combinatorial problem, a constructive heuristic procedure is developed. Moreover, a novel approach is proposed to determine the workers’ skills. Human performance is modelled in terms of the time required to perform consecutive tasks, considering different sequences of tasks. In addition, the model was applied to a real case study to verify its feasibility. Different scenarios are tested, considering different levels of exposure to different risk factors. The results indicate that a limited increase in the makespan enables decreasing the risk level and the achievement of an excellent workload balance among workers in terms of time spent in performing tasks. Moreover, the heuristic procedure has demonstrated to perform well on instances of realistic size, and it could be adapted to many manufacturing systems to solve the problem in real industrial contexts.

AB  - The advent of advanced multi-tasking machines (MTMs) in the metalworking industry has provided the opportunity for more efficient parallel machining as compared to traditional sequential processing. It entailed the need for developing appropriate reasoning schemes for efficient process planning to take advantage of machining capabilities inherent in these machines. This paper addresses an adequate methodical approach for a non-linear process planning with a variety of alternatives, enabled through the STEP_NC standard. A relevant algorithmic approach of high efficacy is developed for feature clustering and operation sequencing based on AND-OR graph modelling. It involves a discrete modelling scheme for setup formulation so that the workload of machine spindles is levelled and its total cycle time is minimized. The so-formulated optimization problem, and related in particular to feature distribution among setups, can be successfully solved by a non-linear generalized reduced gradient (GRC) algorithm. The solution algorithms outlined can be relatively readily implemented in industrial informatics systems of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises. The entire methodical approach is validated through illustrative case studies based on exemplary mill-turn parts.

AB  - Workload assessment is required for human factors validation of control rooms. The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) is a popular measure for this purpose. However, acceptability of workload is difficult to interpret based on the scores, and the measure is time consuming for use in test scenario breaks. This paper reports the identification and evaluation of a one-item subjective rating for the acceptability of mental workload. Study 1 found that one item, mental demand, highly represented the multidimensional TLX and that operators rated this item to be distinct from performance and situation awareness. Study 2 investigated the acceptance scale's sensitivity to control room modification, and the study found that operators' rating of level of mental demand and rating of acceptability of mental demand were moderately related. The rating of acceptability, compared with the original scale, was more sensitive to control room modernisation and was more strongly related to subjective performance. Operators' rating of acceptable workload was significantly related to observers' assessment of team performance, while the rating of level was not. Both acceptable and non-acceptable workload were related to high levels of the original TLX scales, indicating that operators' perception of acceptable workload was not fixated on a particular level of the original TLX scale. The results supported that efficient assessment can be achieved by applying only the TLX mental demand item and by supplementing or replacing the original rating scale with an acceptability rating scale. The approach presented applies to establishing ‘redlines’ for human performance constructs beyond mental workload.
Relevance to industry
High-consequence industries are required to perform human factors validation for new and substantially modified design. While numerous human factors measures are available, approaches for establishing cut-off scores or ‘redlines’ are lacking. This paper investigates acceptability rating to address this challenge.

AB  - Regret theory is a theory that describes human decision-making under risk. The key of obtaining a quantitative model of regret theory is to measure the preference in humans’ mind when they choose among a set of options. Unlike physical quantities, measuring psychological preference is not procedure invariant, i.e. the readings alter when the methods change. In this work, we alleviate this influence by choosing the procedure compatible with the way that an individual makes a choice. We believe the resulting model is closer to the nature of human decision-making. The preference elicitation process is decomposed into a series of short surveys to reduce cognitive workload and increase response accuracy. To make the questions natural and familiar to the subjects, we follow the insight that humans generate, quantify and communicate preference in natural language. The fuzzy sets theory is hence utilized to model responses from subjects. Based on these ideas, a graphical human-computer interface (HCI) is designed to articulate the information as well as to efficiently collect human responses. The design also accounts for human heuristics and biases, e.g. range effect and anchoring effect, to enhance its reliability. The overall performance of the survey is satisfactory because the measured model shows prediction accuracy equivalent to the subjects revisit performance.

AB  - Industrial passive low-back exoskeletons have gained recent attention as ergonomic interventions to manual handling tasks. This research utilized a two-armed experimental approach (single vs dual-task paradigms) to quantify neural and biomechanical tradeoffs associated with short-term human-exoskeleton interaction (HEI) during asymmetrical lifting in twelve healthy adults balanced by gender. A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate dual-task manipulations.

AB  - Advanced production environments emerged as the good solution to address the modern market challenges asking for a wide product mix and low time to market. Within cellular systems, made of independent, modular and flexible working areas, tailored on families of similar products, Serus are of increasing adoption for both manufacturing and assembly tasks. Among them, the so-called divisional Serus are the first step to move from the traditional production lines to a production environment made of a set of identical working areas, parallelising activities and enabling potential productivity increase. Despite their adoption in industry, starting from the electronic sector and moving forward, reference analytic models to predict divisional Seru productivity are rare in the literature, while their formulation and application is a gap to fill. This paper addresses this gap in theory, supporting the transition toward Seru production environment by proposing and proofing the analytic closed-form expressions getting the expected productivity of a divisional Seru made of a generic number of workers and a) one (base case), b) two (extension) and c) a generic number (general case) of product types to produce. Together with the steps to get the productivity expressions for these three cases of immediate practical applicability and not yet proposed by the literature, a case study and sensitivity analysis on the divisional Seru dimension showcase the proposed model industrial use and impact on the expected productivity. Key results highlight a stationary behaviour of the working time for all workers making the Seru productivity dependent on the sum of the workers speed and the product type workloads.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate effects of complexity on cognitive workload in a simulated air traffic control conflict detection task by means of eye movements recording. We manipulated two complexity factors, convergence angle and aircrafts minimum distance at closest approach, in a multidimensional workload assessment method based on psychophysiological, performance, and subjective measures. Conflict trials resulted more complex and time-consuming than no conflicts, requiring more frequent fixations and saccades. Moreover, large saccades showed reduced burst power with higher task complexity. A motion-based and a ratio-based strategy were suggested for conflicts and no conflicts on the basis of ocular metrics analysis: aircrafts differential speed and distance to convergence point at trial start were considered determinant for strategy adoption.
Relevance to industry
Eye metrics measurement for online workload assessment enhances better identification of workload-inducing scenarios and adopted strategy for traffic management. System design, as well as air traffic control operators training programs, might benefit from on line workload measurement.

AB  - Multitasking is a common element in complex human-computer interactions and is known to impose deleterious mental workload demands. High mental workload is known to involve bilateral hemisphere activation, but the patterns of effective connectivity (directed causal influence or communication) among brain regions in such a context remain unclear. This study investigated the effect of mental workload on the causal influence brain regions exert over each other under a multitasking scenario. The Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) method was implemented to infer the flow of information and allocation of attentional resources. Thirty participants performed four subtasks with varying levels of workload on a computer-based multitasking program, simulating a pilot cockpit. Using eight brain regions commonly identified to be activated in multitasking conditions, nine candidate models were developed. Bayesian model averaging was then used to quantify the connectivity strengths among the brain regions. Linear regression was conducted to study the relationships between connection strengths and subtask performances. The results showed that the causal connections shifted from the left to both sides of the brain with increased workload. Linear regression analysis showed that the subtask performance could be predicted by connectivity strengths. Thus, by studying the brain dynamics of mental workload, we may be able to develop a predictor that supplements subjective self-report measures.

AB  - Cargo transfer is a key procedure in port businesses; nevertheless, the electromechanical equipment employed for maintenance should adhere to a set of standards to ensure its proper operation all the time, which may raise production costs. Because of this, every improvement that enables minimizing production losses and expenses over the short, medium, and long time is a decisive choice that companies should consider becoming sustainable. Under this policy, the maintenance process has assumed a significant role as an integral part of the manufacturing process and not only as a dependency of the company. In this study, proposals for improving a port company's maintenance procedure will be analyzed using the discrete event simulation technique. The findings at the task execution stage reveal delays or queues that have a direct impact on the overall time necessary to accomplish maintenance. The reason that the equipment in the locations is not available on time could be due to a lack of supplies or replacement parts required to finish the repair. This has a negative impact on the scheduled maintenance times. Additionally, the simulation results show that incorporating one person into the process improves reaction times. However, the final recommendation is that a future role or workload study should be carried out instead of hiring other employees and, if possible, redistributing workloads among the people who are part of the company.

AB  - Live captioning is a challenging task that requires intense concentration to convert audio to text in real-time. Despite the importance of live captioning for accessibility, little is known about the subjective workload of captioners in this context. This study aimed to measure the subjective workload of live captioners using the NASA-TLX and to explore the factors that contribute to their mental workload. Thirty live captioners participated in the study, completing questionnaires and interviews. Results showed that the subjective mental workload of live captioners is high, similar to that of neurosurgeons. The mental workload was found to be associated with caption paraphrasing and employment status. The challenges of the job, such as the speed of speaking in live content, cognitive tasks involved in paraphrasing, the concern about poor performance, the impact on audiences, and the lack of control over job scheduling contribute to this high workload. These findings suggest the need for modulating the scheduling of the workers, having longer breaks, and working in teams rather than independently. Introducing paradigm changes for live captioning workflow, such as reducing the human effort of typing by adopting auto-generated captions, so that captioners become decision-makers or managers of generational AI systems should also be considered. By addressing these issues, we can help improve the well-being of live captioners and the quality of captions, ultimately enhancing accessibility for all.

AB  - In this paper, we have explored use of Saccadic Intrusion to detect drivers’ cognitive load and instantaneous perception of developing road hazards. Saccadic Intrusion is a type of eye gaze movement which was earlier found to be related to change in cognitive load. We have developed an algorithm to detect saccadic intrusion from a commercially available low-cost eye gaze tracker and conducted four user studies involving a driving simulator and cognitive and hazard perception tests. Our results show that average velocities of saccadic intrusion increases with increase in cognitive load and recording saccadic intrusion and eye blinks for 6 s duration can predict drivers’ instantaneous perception of developing road hazards.

AB  - Manufacturing industry depend heavily on logistic service provider to distribute their product. Logistic company ussualy work based on order from manufacturer. Depending on the circumtances, orders received by logistic service provider in most cases are uncertain. Fluctuations or uncertainty of order becomes a problem to many logistic companies because it affects the way they have to schedule their workers. Workforce scheduling is hence necessary for allocating appropriate worker in the right place and in the right time. Inappropriate workforce scheduling could imbalance workloads within workers which leads to worker dissatisfaction. This study therefore aims to design a workforce scheduling that consider worker workload of Domestics Freight Forwarding particularly in Company X. The research will first measure the workload, both physical and mental workload. The method used for physical workload measurement is based on calorie consumptions based on Indonesia National Standard (SNI). Whereas NASA-TLX subjective approach method is used to measure mental workload. Then, by using the result of the workload measurements, a workforce scheduling model is designed to balance the workload. Goal programing is used to model the workforce scheduling. The result of workload measurement shows that workers have low productivity but high level of mental workload, while for the physical workload there is no significant difference in each warehouse and shipping. In order to increase the utility of the workers, instead of 3 shifts it is suggested that company apply 2 shifts work systems for Checker. Also, minimizing factors that reduce the productivity such the mobility of outstation (dinas luar).

AB  - Despite significant progress in autonomous vehicles (AVs), the development of driving policies that ensure both the safety of AVs and traffic flow efficiency has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning method, termed the Human as AI mentor-based deep reinforcement learning (HAIM-DRL) framework, which facilitates safe and efficient autonomous driving in mixed traffic platoon. Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, we first introduce an innovative learning paradigm that effectively injects human intelligence into AI, termed Human as AI mentor (HAIM). In this paradigm, the human expert serves as a mentor to the AI agent. While allowing the agent to sufficiently explore uncertain environments, the human expert can take control in dangerous situations and demonstrate correct actions to avoid potential accidents. On the other hand, the agent could be guided to minimize traffic flow disturbance, thereby optimizing traffic flow efficiency. In detail, HAIM-DRL leverages data collected from free exploration and partial human demonstrations as its two training sources. Remarkably, we circumvent the intricate process of manually designing reward functions; instead, we directly derive proxy state-action values from partial human demonstrations to guide the agents’ policy learning. Additionally, we employ a minimal intervention technique to reduce the human mentor’s cognitive load. Comparative results show that HAIM-DRL outperforms traditional methods in driving safety, sampling efficiency, mitigation of traffic flow disturbance, and generalizability to unseen traffic scenarios.

AB  - Complex manufacturing systems are challenging to study because of the high level of information required and the inaccessibility of most of it. Their tractability is however essential for the efficiency of state-of-the-art industries. This is particularly the case in the semiconductor industry that faces high mix and low volume conditions, and for which traditional methods fail to capture the high complexity and require continuous actions and corrections to adjust to heterogeneous toolsets and product-mix. We present the Concurrent WIP (CWIP), a new way of studying such systems at the level of a process-cluster by identifying each job's queue from its own perspective. CWIP is designed to be practical, with a low level of resource investments, yet informative. We explain how CWIP can be computed based on historical data and then used to derive capacity estimates and clearing functions without any assumptions on the system or on the form of the functions. In the process, we derive not only an average workload-dependent capacity, but also a confidence interval on this capacity. The relevance and efficiency of the proposed estimates are experimentally tested on a simulated system mimicking a small but complex process-cluster of the semiconductor industry. The estimates are used to predict WIP absorption times and we show how they characterize well not only the average behavior but also the full range of possible behaviors of the system. Finally, we discuss further applications of CWIP, that could be used to compute refined clearing functions or to monitor complex systems.

AB  - This study tried to identify how varied level of content complexity (low vs. medium vs. high) could affect learning outcomes, cognitive load investment, and attitudes when learning basketball tactical actions from different formats of visualization (dynamic vs. static) within physical education context. One hundred and fifty secondary school students (Mage = 15.31 years, SD = .64) took part in the experiment. They were quasi-randomly (i.e., matched for gender) assigned to the six experimental conditions and asked to rate their perceived cognitive load (i.e., mental effort invested and estimated difficulty), indicate their attitudes (i.e., attention, enjoyment, engagement and challenge) and perform the learning tests (i.e., game comprehension test and game performance test) immediately after the learning phase. Results showed that for low-complexity content, both formats of visualization have similar effects on cognitive load investment, and learning outcomes. However, for medium and high complexity contents, the dynamic format had a clear advantage over the static format in terms of cognitive load investment and learning outcomes. Moreover, it was found that whatever the level of content complexity, students exposed to the dynamic visualization reported more positive attitudes compared to those exposed to the static visualization. Considering the learning outcomes and the subjective experiences (i.e., cognitive load and attitudes), the results recommend the use of dynamic visualizations for learning basketball tactical actions whatever the level of content complexity.

The results showed that females’ needs of information acquisition and emotional experience were more gratified compared with males’ needs in the experiment, and interacting with wearable devices while jogging increased users’ cognitive workload and perceived difficulty and decreased users’ level of flow experience compared with interacting while walking. Despite the superiority of the bracelet with a screen, indicated by the results, it is worth noting that displaying information on a mobile app has a good chance of improving the usage experience of the bracelet without a screen.

AB  - As the keystones of the personalized manufacturing, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) consolidated with 3D printing pave the path for the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing. By resembling the age of craft manufacturing, Industry 4.0 expedites the alteration from mass production to mass customization. When distributed 3D printers (3DPs) are shared and collaborated in the IIoT, a promising dynamic, globalized, economical, and time-effective manufacturing environment for customized products will appear. However, the optimum allocation and scheduling of the personalized 3D printing tasks (3DPTs) in the IIoT in a manner that respects the customized attributes submitted for each model while satisfying not only the real-time requirements but also the workload balancing between the distributed 3DPs is an inevitable research challenge that needs further in-depth investigations. Therefore, to address this issue, this paper proposes a real-time green-aware multi-task scheduling architecture for personalized 3DPTs in the IIoT. The proposed architecture is divided into two interconnected folds, namely, allocation and scheduling. A robust online allocation algorithm is proposed to generate the optimal allocation for the 3DPTs. This allocation algorithm takes into consideration meeting precisely the customized user-defined attributes for each submitted 3DPT in the IIoT as well as balancing the workload between the distributed 3DPs simultaneously with improving their energy efficiency. Moreover, meeting the predefined deadline for each submitted 3DPT is among the main objectives of the proposed architecture. Consequently, an adaptive real-time multi-task priority-based scheduling (ARMPS) algorithm has been developed. The built ARMPS algorithm respects both the dynamicity and the real-time requirements of the submitted 3DPTs. A set of performance evaluation tests has been performed to thoroughly investigate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results proved the robustness and scalability of the proposed architecture that surpasses its counterpart state-of-the-art architectures, especially in high-load environments.

AB  - Previous evidence suggests that changes in spontaneous eye blink rate (EBR) in human adults might reflect the amount of attentional demand (i.e. cognitive load) during cognitive tasks. However, the actual direction of this relation is uncertain, since most studies investigated the role of cognitive load on EBR by employing visual tasks only. Here we aimed at elucidating the relationship between EBR and cognitive load in non-visual tasks. Sixteen healthy participants performed two auditory oddball tasks, i.e. passive listening to auditory tones versus active counting of target tones; each oddball task was immediately followed by a rest phase. Throughout the oddball tasks we assessed EBR and recorded the P300 on ERPs as an electrophysiological measure of attention. The results showed that participants’ EBR increased during the active task compared to the respective rest phase. Amplitude and latency of the P300 too differed between passive and active tasks, but changes in EBR and P300 features were not correlated with each other. Our findings demonstrated that an increase in cognitive load is associated with an increase in EBR in cognitive tasks not involving visual attention. These findings are consistent with previous evidence suggesting shared neurobiological bases between attention and EBR.

AB  - The assessment and optimisation of postural stress and physical fatigue can be challenging and is typically conducted only after the design of manual operations has been finalised. However early assessment of manual operations and identification of critical factors that are deemed outside of an appropriate envelope can avoid the time and costs often associated with re-designing machines and layout for operator work processes. This research presents a low cost software solution based on a simplified skeleton model that uses operator position and workload data extracted from a simulation model used for virtual manufacturing process planning. The developed approach aims to assess postural stress and physical fatigue scores of assembly operations, as they are being designed and simulated virtually. The model is based on the Automotive Assembly Worksheet and the Garg's metabolic rate prediction model. The proposed research focuses on the integration of virtual process planning, ergonomic and metabolic analysis tools, and on automating human factor assessment to enable optimisation of assembly operations and workload capabilities at early design stage.

AB  - Passenger ships have complex transportation systems and seafarers face high workloads, making them susceptible to serious injuries and fatalities in the event of accidents. Existing unimodal workload recognition for seafarers mainly focuses on fixed load induction in bridge simulators, whereas a multimodal approach using multi-sensor data fusion can overcome the reliability and sensitivity limitations of a single sensor. To accurately identify the workload of seafarers, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal fusion method at the feature layer and utilise the Gini index to determine the feature weight of the multimodal data. Through a real ship navigation experiment, the subjective workload assessment technique (SWAT) was employed to collect the continuous workload scores of 24 seafarers in daily tasks. Further, the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory was used to integrate these scores with the unsafe behavior probability of seafarers to obtain a calibrated workload. Electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals were collected in real time, and a high-dimensional feature matrix was extracted to construct the workload recognition model. Random forest, XGBoost, and back-propagation neural networks were used to establish multimodal fusion workload recognition models at the feature-fusion stage, and the model performances were compared. The results showed that the multimodal fusion based on EEG, ECG, and EDA had an excellent recognition accuracy. The XGBoost algorithm has better performance with an accuracy of 85.72%, which is an increment of 9.49% compared to that of the unimodal algorithm, and this improvement passed the statistical significance test. Important features suitable for multimodal fusion recognition were also analysed. The findings of this study have profound significance for enhancing risk control measures pertaining to human factors and ensuring navigation safety.

AB  - Neuroimaging studies for human participants have shown that the activity in the multiple-demand (MD) network is associated with various kinds of cognitive demand. However, surprisingly, it remains unclear how this MD network is related to a core component of cognition, the process of searching for a target among distractors. This was because previous neuroimaging studies of visual search were confounded by task difficulty or time on task. To circumvent these limitations, we examined human brain activity while participants perform two different visual search tasks. The performance of a task was limited by increased attentional demand, while the other task was primarily limited by poor quality of input data or neural noise. Throughout the MD network, increased activity and strengthened functional connectivity among the MD regions were observed under the search task recruiting capacity-limited attentional resources. The present findings provide unequivocal evidence that the MD network mediates visual search, as well as other capacity-limited cognitive processes.

AB  - Knowledge about intra-limb coordination (ILC) during challenging walking conditions provides insight into the adaptability of central nervous system (CNS) for controlling human gait. We assessed the effects of cognitive load and speed on the pattern and variability of the ILC in young people during walking. Thirty healthy young people (19 female and 11 male) participated in this study. They were asked to perform 9 walking trials on a treadmill, including walking at three paces (preferred, slower and faster) either without a cognitive task (single-task walking) or while subtracting 1׳s or 3׳s from a random three-digit number (simple and complex dual-task walking, respectively). Deviation phase (DP) and mean absolute relative phase (MARP) values—indicators of variability and phase dynamic of ILC, respectively—were calculated using the data collected by a motion capture system. We used a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance for statistical analysis. The results showed that cognitive load had a significant main effect on DP of right shank–foot and thigh–shank, left shank–foot and pelvis–thigh (p<0.05), and MARP of both thigh–shank segments (p<0.01). In addition, the main effect of walking speed was significant on DP of all segments in each side and MARP of both thigh–shank and pelvis–thigh segments (p<0.001). The interaction of cognitive load and walking speed was only significant for MARP values of left shank–foot and right pelvis–thigh (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). We suggest that cognitive load and speed could significantly affect the ILC and variability and phase dynamic during walking.

AB  - The manufacturing industry is undergoing rapid evolution, necessitating flexible and adaptable robots. However, configuring such machines requires technical experts, which are hard to find, especially for small and medium enterprises. Therefore, the process needs to be simplified by allowing non-experts to configure robots. During such configuration, one key aspect is the definition of objects’ grasping poses. The literature proposes deep learning techniques to compute grasping poses automatically and facilitate the process. Nevertheless, practical implementation for inexperienced factory operators can be challenging, especially if task-specific knowledge and constraints should be considered. To overcome this barrier, we propose an approach that facilitates teaching such poses. Our method, employing a novel user grasp metric, combines the operator's initial grasp guess given by a 3D spatial device with a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, thus returning reliable grasping poses but simultaneously close to the operator's initial guess. We compare this approach against commercial grasping pose definition interfaces through a user test involving 28 participants and against state-of-the-art deep learning grasp estimators. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in system usability (+24%) and a reduced workload (-16%). Furthermore, our experiments reveal an increased grasp success rate when utilizing the user grasp metric, surpassing state-of-the-art deep learning grasping estimators.

AB  - In the petrochemical industry, control room operators must address safety-critical alarms and other tasks using complex interfaces. This study developed a guide for assessing human performance using standard human factors measurement tools, and tested the sensitivity of those tools with two interface designs (i.e., gray and black) at three levels of workload (i.e., easy, medium, and difficult). The guide measures human performance through speed and accuracy, perceived workload using two standard instruments (i.e., NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT)), situation awareness through the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), and gaze through eye tracking coordinates. Twelve engineering student participants completed one simulation session at each of the three workload levels using one of two interface designs. Workload was manipulated through the number of simulated events (failures) in each session. Overall, the speed and accuracy measures, workload ratings, and eye tracking showed sensitivity to differences in workload level, and situation awareness showed sensitivity to the interaction between workload level and interface type. None of the tools were sensitive to interface type alone. Accuracy was highest under easy workload. Time per failure decreased at higher workload levels. Perceived workload ratings from the SWAT increased as workload increased, but workload ratings from the NASA-TLX were not different across workload levels. When workload increased, situation awareness remained steady for the gray interface but decreased sharply for the black interface, illustrating an interaction effect. Finally, the percentage of time spent looking at different areas of the screen during steady-state periods differed among workload levels. The tools in this guide can be used in the petrochemical industry to make design decisions for control room interfaces when workload levels are a concern.

AB  - Ever increasing demand for individualized and customized products induce the need for high variability in production and manufacturing through Mass Customisation. Mass Customisation requires more flexibility and adaptability capabilities in production systems. Matrix Production is a tact free job-shop like production system enabling variable production routing through a matrix shaped layout of partially redundant machines. Hence, it is one way to increase a production system’s flexibility and adaptability. A more powerful production control system comes hand in hand with the evolution towards a tact free Matrix Production System. However, the additional degree of freedom due to the flexibility not only touches production control, but also production planning, thus enabling the production of portfolio external products. Implementation of a Product Generation Module optimizes the workload of Matrix Production Systems to increase their efficiency by assessing the suitability of co-production of portfolio external products. Generation of suitable production orders increase machine utilization without impeding the original multi-dimensional production goals. Thus, reaching new production strategies that include the creation of value through effective manipulation of minor products and byproducts. The flexibility of Matrix Production Systems acts as the Product Generation Modules enabler, insofar as flexibility is the ability of a system to perform within an acceptable production corridor without layout and planning adjustments. This can be enhanced by making use of the Matrix Production Systems adaptability to increase the set of portfolio external products through layout and planning adjustments. Hence, this strategy leads to a continuous automated planning phase and additional revenue due to the additional manufacture of minor products within a Matrix Production System. Doing so allows the Matrix Production System to react towards external demand related and internal capacity related events without sacrificing precious value creation opportunities.

AB  - Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are transforming customer service by making it possible to create chatbot applications that can understand users’ intents and response in a human-like manner. Chatbots promise to enhance customer experiences by creating more personal customer interactions than those afforded by traditional menu-based web applications. But are chatbots always superior to more traditional user interfaces (UI)? This study seeks to understand the differences in user satisfaction with a chatbot system vis-a-vis a menu-based interface system, and identify factors that influence user satisfaction. Grounded in the self-determination theory, the research model proposed here focuses on the effect of chatbot use on perceived autonomy, perceived competence, cognitive load, performance satisfaction, and system satisfaction. An experimental study was conducted, and data were analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. The findings indicate that chatbot systems lead to a lower level of perceived autonomy and higher cognitive load, compared with menu-based interface systems, resulting in a lower degree of user satisfaction. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - While motivation affects safety-related decision-making and human reliability, technologies to promote it are scarcely used. We have only recently witnessed how motivational technologies, including serious games, gamification, and persuasive technologies have emerged on the palette of methods for enhancing transportation safety. However, the research on these technologies for transportation safety is fragmented, preventing future studies and practical efforts. This paper describes the state-of-the-art through a systematic review to address this issue. Analyzing 62 studies, we perceive that motivational technologies focus on reducing the accident likelihood and mitigating their consequences. While these technologies can induce positive psychological change and improve learning, the evidence of behavioral change is mainly limited to simulation settings, lacking examination of the long-term benefits and potential adverse effects. Our results highlight the importance of aligning motivational design with the cognitive demand of the transportation task and the means for improving safety. Future research should explore how motivational technologies can enhance safety from the system design perspective, cover a broader scope of transportation modes, compare their effects to conventional approaches while considering social aspects in their design and evaluation. Beside providing an overview of the area and future directions, this paper also introduces design recommendations to guide practitioners.

AB  - Wayfinding is a representation of the adaptive behavior of humans. Research has shown that urban environments impact pedestrians' perception and cognition, and wayfinding is a common activity in various urban settings. However, it is unclear if there are variations in pedestrians' cognitive processes of wayfinding in different urban environments. This study investigated how urban spatial environments (residential district vs. commercial district; RD vs. CD) and lighting environments (daytime vs. nighttime) impact pedestrians' wayfinding behaviors in terms of time and space. Eye tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), and behavioural data from forty-three pedestrians were collected to compare their perceptual, decision-making, and task-execution processes in different environmental conditions. The study found that pedestrians in residential areas had lower spatial perception and attentional control, but higher decision speed and cognitive load compared to pedestrians in commercial areas during the perceptual decision-making phase. Pedestrians in daytime environments experience reduced spatial perception but increased cognitive load and enhanced attentional control compared to nighttime condition. In the task execution phase, the completion time was longer in the residential area compared to the commercial area. However, there was no significant difference in terms of task performance, such as average speed, and no direct correlation was found between the light environment and task performance. Participants exhibited different pathfinding strategies across different urban environments. This study extends the research of urban environments and has practical implications for urban spatial environment construction, lighting design, and navigation system optimization.

AB  - The neural systems that afford our ability to evaluate rewards and punishments are impacted by a variety of external factors. Here, we demonstrate that increased cognitive load reduces the functional efficacy of a reward processing system within the human medial–frontal cortex. In our paradigm, two groups of participants used performance feedback to estimate the exact duration of one second while electroencephalographic (EEG) data was recorded. Prior to performing the time estimation task, both groups were instructed to keep their eyes still and avoid blinking in line with well established EEG protocol. However, during performance of the time-estimation task, one of the two groups was provided with trial-to-trial-feedback about their performance on the time-estimation task and their eye movements to induce a higher level of cognitive load relative to participants in the other group who were solely provided with feedback about the accuracy of their temporal estimates. In line with previous work, we found that the higher level of cognitive load reduced the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity, a component of the human event-related brain potential associated with reward evaluation within the medial–frontal cortex. Importantly, our results provide further support that increased cognitive load reduces the functional efficacy of a neural system associated with reward processing.

Two important findings are necessary for the appropriate introduction of KEIROKA assistive technologies, such as power-assistive suits and work support robots, into the field. One is to know the physical abilities and skills of each worker. The other is to quantify the work content and physical burden of each worker. We have tested the physical performance of construction workers, conducted questionnaires on back pain, and also measured their physical workload using wearable sensors. The workload did not change with the presence or absence of LBP and age but tended to change with physical ability.

A heuristic algorithm is developed for identical machines which process with the same tool. A system in which jobs with stochastic workloads arrive randomly and upon arrival, their workload is facilitated by IoT. The proposed algorithm determines the assignment of workload to the machine and processing speed. The algorithm works for both online and offline frameworks.

AB  - Mental workload is a key factor influencing the occurrence of human error, especially during piloting and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations, where safety depends on the ability of pilots to act appropriately. In particular, excessively high or low mental workload can lead operators to neglect critical information. The objective of the present study is to investigate the potential of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) – a non-invasive method of measuring prefrontal cortex activity – in combination with measurements of heart rate variability (HRV), to predict mental workload during a simulated piloting task, with particular regard to task engagement and disengagement. Twelve volunteers performed a computer-based piloting task in which they were asked to follow a dynamic target with their aircraft, a task designed to replicate key cognitive demands associated with real life ROV operating tasks. In order to cover a wide range of mental workload levels, task difficulty was manipulated in terms of processing load and difficulty of control – two critical sources of workload associated with piloting and remotely operating a vehicle. Results show that both fNIRS and HRV are sensitive to different levels of mental workload; notably, lower prefrontal activation as well as a lower LF/HF ratio at the highest level of difficulty, suggest that these measures are suitable for mental overload detection. Moreover, these latter measurements point toward the existence of a quadratic model of mental workload.

AB  - In semiconductor manufacturing, machines are usually qualified to process a limited number of recipes related to products. It is possible to qualify recipes on machines to better balance the workload on machines in a given toolset. However, all machines of a toolset do not have equal uptimes and may further suffer from scheduled and unscheduled downtimes. This may heavily impact an efficient recipe-to-machine qualification configuration. In this paper, we propose indicators for recipe-to-machine qualification management based on the overall toolset workload balance under capacity constraints. The models, deployed in industry, demonstrate that the toolset capacity must be considered while managing qualifications. Industrial experiments show how capacity consideration leads to an optimal qualification configuration and therefore capacity utilization.

We measured neurophysiologic responses and task performance while participants solved mazes after choosing whether to adopt an imperfect helper algorithm.
BACKGROUND
Every day we must decide whether to trust or distrust algorithms. Will an algorithm improve our performance on a task? What if we trust it too much?
METHOD
Participants had to pay to use the algorithm and were aware that it offered imperfect help. We varied the information about the algorithm to assess the factors that affected adoption while measuring participants’ peripheral neurophysiology.
RESULTS
We found that information about previous adoption by others had a larger effect on adoption and resulted in lower cognitive load than did information about algorithm accuracy. The neurophysiologic measurement showed that algorithm adoption without any information resulted in low cognitive engagement during the task and impaired task performance. Conversely, algorithm use after information about others’ use improved engagement and performance.
CONCLUSION
By objectively measuring cognitive load and task performance, we identified how to increase algorithm adoption while sustaining high performance by human operators.
APPLICATION
Algorithm adoption can be increased by sharing previous use information and performance improved by providing a reason to monitor the algorithm.
Precis
We collected neurophysiologic data while varying information about an algorithm that assisted participants in solving a timed and incentivized maze and found that information about prior use by others more effectively influenced adoption, reduced cognitive load, and improved performance compared to algorithm accuracy information.

KW  - Cognitive load theory

KW  - Relations between working and long-term memory
AB  - Cognitive load theory is used to design instruction. Several aspects of human cognition are critical to instructional design. First, the theory assumes we have not specifically evolved to learn the topics taught in educational and training institutions. Second, these topics require learners to acquire domain-specific rather than generic–cognitive knowledge. Third, while generic–cognitive knowledge does not require explicit instruction because we have evolved to acquire it, domain-specific concepts and skills do require explicit instruction. These factors interact with the capacity and duration constraints of working memory to delineate a cognitive architecture relevant to instructional design. The working memory limits do not apply to biologically primary, generic–cognitive knowledge acquired without explicit instruction but do apply to biologically secondary, domain-specific knowledge that requires explicit instruction. Accordingly, cognitive load theory has been developed to provide techniques that reduce unnecessary working memory load when dealing with explicitly taught, biologically secondary, domain-specific knowledge.

Jackson strength evaluation system was used to measure isometric pull strengths while IXTA Data Acquisition System to measure and analyze the muscle activity. The experiments were conducted with twenty work-in-process (WIP) manual material handlers of an apparel manufacturing industry. Electromyographical (EMG) data of muscle activity was collected by placing electrodes on pronator teres, brachial biceps, pectoralis major and lower trapezius muscles during the pull tasks. The results show that torso pull in seated posture has the maximum isometric average value of 62.20 ± 5.91 kg while arm lift has the minimum strength value of 37.10 ± 4.61 kg. Assessment of muscle fatigue caused by pulling force is important in determining job severity of workers and mitigating occupational injuries which help in balancing workloads for effective management.

AB  - Both workload peaks and lows contribute to lower employee well-being. Predictive employee workload analytics can empower management to undertake proactive prevention. For this purpose, we develop a real-time machine learning framework to predict and explain future workload in a challenging environment with variable and imbalanced workload: the digital control rooms for railway traffic management of Infrabel, Belgium’s railway infrastructure company. The proposed two-stage methodology leverages granular data of workload categories that are very different in nature and separates the effects of workload presence and magnitude. In this way, the set-up addresses the changing workload mix over 15-minute intervals. We extensively benchmark machine learning and deep learning models within this context, leading to LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) as the best-performing model. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values highlight the benefits of disentangling presence and magnitude and reveal associations with human-machine interaction and team exposure. As a proof of concept, our implemented predictive model offers tailored decision support to the traffic supervisor in an explainable way. In particular, the tool depicts overloaded and/or underloaded workstations and provides in-depth insights through local SHAP values.

AB  - Human-AI collaboration has become common, integrating highly complex AI systems into the workplace. Still, it is often ineffective; impaired perceptions – such as low trust or limited understanding – reduce compliance with recommendations provided by the AI system. Drawing from cognitive load theory, we examine two techniques of human-AI collaboration as potential remedies. In three experimental studies, we grant users decision control by empowering them to adjust the system’s recommendations, and we offer explanations for the system’s reasoning. We find decision control positively affects user perceptions of trust and understanding, and improves user compliance with system recommendations. Next, we isolate different effects of providing explanations that may help explain inconsistent findings in recent literature: while explanations help reenact the system’s reasoning, they also increase task complexity. Further, the effectiveness of providing an explanation depends on the specific user’s cognitive ability to handle complex tasks. In summary, our study shows that users benefit from enhanced decision control, while explanations – unless appropriately designed for the specific user – may even harm user perceptions and compliance. This work bears both theoretical and practical implications for the management of human-AI collaboration.

AB  - Embedded devices are used in many domains, including healthcare, industries, and home automation, all of which entail significant workloads. As a direct consequence, the embedded devices require retrieval and processing of data of large volume, which occupy large memory space in the embedded devices. Compression along with workload characterization is an effective technique for minimizing memory usage and to the improvement of endurance of memory in such devices. This paper investigates the embedded workload characterization using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) that is particularly suitable for large-scale datasets and real-time applications. Though ELM is single-layer feedforward network, its input weight randomization has a considerable effect on the accuracy of the classification. In this paper, the authors have proposed a hybrid algorithm for the optimization of the randomization of ELM. The Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO), the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Ant Colony Optimizer (ACO), and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) were used in the optimization of the classification process in ELM to increase the accuracy of the results. The input data must be categorized based on the energy consumed by each workload to proceed with further processing according to the system requirements. This paper explores and analyses the performance of hybridized ELM-Genetic algorithm (ELM-GA), ELM-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), ELM-Ant Colony Optimizer (ELM-ACO), and ELM- Whale Optimization Algorithm (ELM-WOA) optimization algorithms. The embedded benchmarks Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Mi Benchmark (MiBench), and Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium (EEMBC) have been used as a dataset for classification in this paper. The extensive experimental study shows that the hybridized ELM-WOA provides a 98.5 % classification accuracy, 98.1 % specificity, and 98 % sensitivity compared to the other optimization methods discussed in this paper.

AB  - Human-cybernetic interfaces (HCI) focuses on the integration and synergy of human-centric design, human factors (HFs) and economics, and human–machine interaction (HMI). The scrutiny of single pilot operations (SPO) approval from civil aviation authorities (CAAs) is subject to the aviation safety and pilot capability during exceptional handling and flight emergency. Airliners advocate the possibility from dual pilot operations (DPO) to SPO because of the financial considerations and captain shortage in the post-pandemic era. One could expect that SPO can only realise when reduced crew operations initiative is proven to be safe and airworthy. Public concerns pilot mental workload and potentially low situational awareness (SA) when handling overwhelmed multi-source information from the HMI in a cockpit, leading to degraded skills and flying performance. Advanced head up display (HUD) design, an integrated transparent display, can assist pilots in maintaining their optimal performance when SPO exercised. In this study, we are interested to design a SPO-favoured cockpit design with HUD and investigate the potential of integrating augmented reality (AR) and HUD in SPO in flight operations. An experiment involving 21 pilots was conducted to assess the effectiveness of AR-HUD on SA and workload in DPO, SPO, and SPO with AR-HUD scenarios. The Situation Awareness Present Assessment Method (SPAM) and a self-rated workload scale were used to evaluate SA and workload levels. Eye-tracking data was also collected to analyse behavioural performance. Results indicated that the AR-HUD scenario achieved optimal workload and SA levels and demonstrated superior performance in handling emergencies. Eye-tracking data revealed that AR-HUD facilitated a more equitable distribution of gaze between instruments and external view. In conclusion, the integration of AR in cockpit design introduces a human-centric interaction paradigm, contributing to aviation safety, SPO implementation and adaptive HMI design.

AB  - Swarm robotics is a natural candidate for monitoring large and complex environments. With the aid of a human who is directly involved in monitoring and search using a teleoperated robot, swarms of autonomous robots can solve problems related to navigation and changing objectives. In this context, understanding the role of nonverbal interactions have the potential to enable rapid and bidirectional communication between humans and robots. Quantifying such interactions however, requires a repeatable and engaging experimental setup that can track human action and cognition. This paper describes a desktop virtual reality testbed designed specifically to quantify human actions, perception, and cognitive load in real time during a monitoring mission. Motivated by recent deployment of underwater robots to monitor invasive species, the testbed is designed to mimic an underwater environment within the Great Lakes with five species of fish whose appearance, locomotion, and behavior are modeled based on videos from the field. Brain activity and pupillometry data are recorded synchronously in real time to aid in the measurement of cognitive load of the human operator. To quantify human perception, empirical data of visual acuity from the literature is used to model virtual object recognition. The capabilities of the testbed are evaluated in terms of frame rate achieved as a function of number of fish and robots in the environment, and demonstrated through two examples highlighting possible uses in human-swarm interaction studies.

AB  - This paper addresses the reliability analysis for a real-world apparel manufacturing system by using fuzzy mathematics. The studied apparel manufacturing system is a precise handicraft profession which involves a great amount of labor-intensive processes. To consider human performance, the apparel manufacturing system is constructed as a fuzzy multistate network, termed apparel manufacturing network (AMN). The workload state of a workstation in the AMN is defined by three fuzzy membership functions: “under-normal-workload”, “normal-workload”, and “over-normal-workload”. Hence, the workload of a workstation is fuzzy multistate and the workstation-reliability is measured by three fuzzy membership functions. Subsequently, the system reliability is evaluated in terms of all workstation-reliabilities, and is derived by fuzzy intersection. The reliability analysis can help the production manager to understand the demand satisfaction of the AMN.

To prevent workload-related diseases, improve work design, and maintain productivity in manual processes as order picking, an optimization approach to integrate ergonomics into resource planning is introduced. The objective is to evenly distribute physical workload among workers in a shift. Applying the Design Science Research Method, this paper presents the conceptual process design of the developed ergonomic order assignment. An assessment of the individual workload per order and worker combination is introduced, considering individual characteristics of typical orders. It is followed by a reference implementation.

AB  - Due to mass customization product variety increased steeply in the automotive industry, entailing the increment of worker’s cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Although worker assistance methods for cognitive automation already exist, they proof insufficient in terms of usability and achieved time saving. Given the rising importance of simulation towards autonomous production planning, a novel approach is proposed using human simulation data in context of worker assistance methods to alleviate cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Within this paper, a new concept for augmented reality-based worker assistance is presented. Additionally, a comparative user study (N=24) was conducted with conventional worker assistance methods to evaluate a prototypical implementation of the concept. The results illustrate the enhancing opportunity of the novel approach to save cognitive abilities and to induce performance improvements. The implementation provided stable information presentation during the entire experiment. However, with regard to the recentness, there has to be carried out further developments and research, concerning performance adaptions and investigations of the effectiveness.

AB  - Workload control (WLC) relies on order release (input control) and capacity adjustments (output control) to regulate manufacturing throughput times. Research concerning integrated input-output control is very scarce. A novel approach is proposed: a closed-loop integrated model, where automatic feedback control is added and where order release and capacity decisions are a continuous function of the shop floor current state. In existing models, capacity increments are triggered by a threshold utilisation and have a fixed value, defined by means of experiments. In the proposed approach, these values are dynamically and flexibly defined (by the controller), addressing a gap regarding input-output parameterisation. The model was applied to a shop with unidirectional flow and three control rules were tested in scenarios of unbalanced work in process (WIP) and demand fluctuations. The results showed that the simultaneous input-output control is effective, leading the system to restore WIP balance, reach stability and absorb demand fluctuations, especially when global information is provided to the controller. The results of continuous closed-loop model simulation were integrated into a discrete-event simulation (DES) model, to compare the proposed capacity policies with the policies presented in the literature. The comparison showed that the proposed policies are cost-effective for a reasonable throughput time reduction. Moreover, the closed-loop model provided good parameters for a step-increment capacity policy that minimizes throughput times. Closed-loop control models are responsive and prescriptive, in contrast to DES models used in WLC research, which are descriptive. With this approach, WLC research can benefit from the strengths of both methods.

AB  - Medical image interpretation is moving from using 2D- to volumetric images, thereby changing the cognitive and perceptual processes involved. This is expected to affect medical students' experienced cognitive load, while learning image interpretation skills. With two studies this explorative research investigated whether measures inherent to image interpretation, i.e. human-computer interaction and eye tracking, relate to cognitive load. Subsequently, it investigated effects of volumetric image interpretation on second-year medical students' cognitive load. Study 1 measured human-computer interactions of participants during two volumetric image interpretation tasks. Using structural equation modelling, the latent variable ‘volumetric image information’ was identified from the data, which significantly predicted self-reported mental effort as a measure of cognitive load. Study 2 measured participants' eye movements during multiple 2D and volumetric image interpretation tasks. Multilevel analysis showed that time to locate a relevant structure in an image was significantly related to pupil dilation, as a proxy for cognitive load. It is discussed how combining human-computer interaction and eye tracking allows for comprehensive measurement of cognitive load. Combining such measures in a single model would allow for disentangling unique sources of cognitive load, leading to recommendations for implementation of volumetric image interpretation in the medical education curriculum.

AB  - Understanding how skilled workers interact with assistance systems in manufacturing and how they experience the factory environment is fundamental to modeling human interaction and optimizing the processes correctly. This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners’ evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multi-criteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human–machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems.

AB  - This paper presents an Augmented Reality (AR)-based network cabling tutoring system that trains users how to interconnect cables within a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) on a physical switching rack. AR arrows combined with text-based instruction and a checklist provided assistance during practical learning. When learners made a mistake, an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) identified the source of the mistake and provided real-time feedback using text, AR and text-to-speech mechanisms. The design was motivated by the human-cognitive architecture and its five evolutionary principles (proposed by Sweller and Sweller (2006)). Users performed four consecutive network cabling training tasks with assistance from our ITS. We found that users made fewer errors when the AR cues, text-based instruction and checklist solutions were replaced with summarised information and then removed completely in the final task compared to those who used an identical system with fixed instruction. Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) explains our results by suggesting that the instructional mechanisms become redundant as knowledge increases. Implications of the study are discussed as well as how AR can help facilitate knowledge transfer in the network cabling domain.

AB  - The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is crucial for motivation, reward- and error-guided decision-making, yet its excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms remain poorly explored in humans. In particular, the balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I), demonstrated to play a role in animal studies, is difficult to measure in behaving humans. Here, we used functional magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy (1H-fMRS) to measure the brain's major inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (Glutamate) neurotransmitters during reinforcement learning with three different conditions: high cognitive load (uncertainty); probabilistic discrimination learning; and a control null-condition. Participants learned to prefer the gain option in the discrimination phase and had no preference in the other conditions. We found increased GABA levels during the uncertainty condition, potentially reflecting recruitment of inhibitory systems during high cognitive load when trying to learn. Further, higher GABA levels during the null (baseline) condition correlated with improved discrimination learning. Finally, glutamate and GABA levels were correlated during high cognitive load. These results suggest that availability of dACC inhibitory resources enables successful learning. Our approach helps elucidate the potential contribution of the balance between excitation and inhibition to learning and motivation in behaving humans.

AB  - Online shopping is becoming one of the most popular applications on the Internet. Websites are the important interfaces in HCI (Human–Computer Interaction). Website design significantly affects online shopping behavior. This research used eye-tracker to track the eye-movement process for 42 college students when they were surfing websites with different levels of complexity and completing simple and complex tasks respectively. The study examines how website complexity and task complexity jointly affect users' visual attention and behavior due to different cognitive loads. The study fills a research gap by examining this phenomenon from the cognitive load perspective and taking the moderate effect of task complexity into consideration. The results show that task complexity can moderate the effect of website complexity on users' visual attention and behavior. Specifically, when users conducted a simple task, fixation count and task completion time were at the highest level on the website with high complexity, while fixation duration was not significantly different on the websites with different complexity. However, when users conducted a complex task on a website with medium complexity, task completion time, fixation count, and fixation duration were all at their highest level. The load theory of attention was used to provide the explanation for the results. The findings provide guidelines for website managers and designers to maximize users' visual attention.

AB  - With higher levels of automation in modern manufacturing, there is increased monitoring of the process by the human operator. Prolonged monitoring or sustained attention has been found to be stressful for human operators. Plant and process operators have also been found to have one of the highest level of work demands (work speed, pace) in a recent European survey (Eurofound, 2015). Along with this, the incidence of Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs) remains at a high level in the manufacturing sector. This research endeavoured to determine if end-tidal CO2 levels decreased and upper trapezius muscle activity increased concurrently with increased levels of attention. We then developed a model to investigate if end-tidal CO2 moderated the relationship between mental workload due to sustained attention and upper trapezius muscle activity. The resulting interactional model found that end-tidal CO2 moderated the relationship (p = 0.004) when end-tidal CO2 reached the hypocapnic range (>35 mm Hg). This model indicates the possibility that a high level of sustained attention is a risk factor in the development of WRMSDs and should therefore be included in workplace risk assessments.

AB  - The development of dynamic data-based Decision Support Systems (DSSs) along with the increasing availability of data in the industry, makes real-time data acquisition and management a challenge. Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios. This is achieved by providing the middleware interoperability, determinism, and automatic data structuring over an industrial communication infrastructure such as the OPC UA Standard over Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). Cloud services and database warehousing used to address some of the challenges are handled using fog computing and a multi-workload database. This paper presents an implementation of the platform in the pharmaceutical industry, providing interoperability and real-time reaction capability to changes to an industrial prototype using dynamic scheduling algorithms.

AB  - Objective
The objective of our work was to assess the impact of flight conditions by aircraft type on the workload estimated using NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).
Background
Learning about subjective workload is important for assessing the impact of a pilot's work environment on their performance in the cockpit. This is an important element of flight safety and includes the prevention of aviation accidents.
Methods
The study included 146 military pilots that fly the following aircrafts: flying fast-jet (21), fixed-wing (24), and rotary-wing (101). The NASA-TLX questionnaire was used to assess workload and pilots were asked to determine the level of workload resulting from flying under the following conditions: daytime flight (VFR), night-vision flight performed under Night Visual Flight Rules (NVFR), and night-vision flight using night-vision goggles (NVGs).
Results
The highest level of workload was consistently attributed to flights performed under NVG conditions. NVFR conditions were rated as the most burdensome, while VFR conditions were rated as the least burdensome. Fast-jet pilots rated their mental performance and effort workload as significantly higher than pilots of other aircrafts.
Conclusion
Pilots’ perceived workload is influenced by both flight conditions and the type of aircraft they fly. Workload knowledge is important for flight safety and should be taken into account during training and flight-task planning.
Application
The results of our study can be useful both in flight training and in work on the effectiveness of the human-machine interface. Awareness of one's own limitations due to the work environment can help improve flight safety.

AB  - This paper proposes an adaptive human-machine collaboration paradigm based on machine learning. Human-machine collaboration requires more than letting humans and machines interact according to fixed rules. A decision-maker is needed to assess production status and to activate adaptations that improve productivity and workers’ well-being. The proposed solution has been tested in an injection moulding manufacturing line. By introducing a physiological monitoring system and a smart decision-maker, relief from fatigue and mental stress is pursued by adjusting the level of support offered through a cobot. Results reported a reduction of operators’ physical and mental workload as well as productivity increase.

AB  - This bibliography reviews the solution methods developed for the design and balancing problems of production lines such as assembly and disassembly lines. The line design problem aims in determining the number of workstations along with the corresponding assignment of tasks to each workstation, while the line balancing problem seeks an assignment of tasks, to the existing workstations of the line, which ensures that the workloads are as equal as possible among the workstations. These two optimisation problems can be also integrated and treated as a multi-objective optimisation problem. This review considers both deterministic and stochastic formulations for disassembly lines and is limited to assembly line design and balancing under uncertainty. This bibliography covers more than 90 publications since 1976 for assembly and 1999 for disassembly.

AB  - Quality control is a crucial activity manufacturing companies perform to ensure their products conform to the requirements and specifications. The introduction of artificial intelligence models enables to automate the visual quality inspection, speeding up the inspection process and ensuring all products are evaluated under the same criteria. In this research, we compare supervised and unsupervised defect detection techniques and explore data augmentation techniques to mitigate the data imbalance in the context of automated visual inspection. Furthermore, we use Generative Adversarial Networks for data augmentation to enhance the classifiers’ discriminative performance. Our results show that state-of-the-art unsupervised defect detection does not match the performance of supervised models but can reduce the labeling workload if tolerating some labeling errors. Furthermore, the best classification performance was achieved considering GAN-based data generation with AUC ROC scores equal to or higher than 0,9898. We performed the research with real-world data provided by Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV.

AB  - In a human–robot collaborative production system, the robot could make request for interaction or notify the human operator if an uncertainty arises. Conventional industrial tower lights were designed for generic machine signalling purposes which may not be the ultimate solution for robot signalling in a collaborative setting. In this type of system, human operators could be monitoring multiple robots while carrying out a manual task so it is important to minimise the diversion of their attention. This paper presents a novel robot signalling solution, the Robot Light Skin (RLS),which is an integrated signalling system that could be used on most articulated robots. Our experiment was conducted to validate this concept in terms of its effect on improving operator's reaction time, hit-rate, awareness and task performance. The results showed that participants reacted faster to the RLS as well as achieved higher hit-rate. An eye tracker was used in the experiment which shows a reduction in diversion away from the manual task when using the RLS. Future study should explore the effect of the RLS concept on large-scale systems and multi-robot systems.

AB  - Summary
Aberrant cognitive network activity and cognitive deficits are established features of chronic pain. However, the nature of cognitive network alterations associated with chronic pain and their underlying mechanisms require elucidation. Here, we report that the claustrum, a subcortical nucleus implicated in cognitive network modulation, is activated by acute painful stimulation and pain-predictive cues in healthy participants. Moreover, we discover pathological activity of the claustrum and a region near the posterior inferior frontal sulcus of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (piDLPFC) in migraine patients during acute pain and cognitive task performance. Dynamic causal modeling suggests a directional influence of the claustrum on activity in this piDLPFC region, and diffusion weighted imaging verifies their structural connectivity. These findings advance understanding of claustrum function during acute pain and provide evidence of a possible circuit mechanism driving cognitive impairments in chronic pain.
