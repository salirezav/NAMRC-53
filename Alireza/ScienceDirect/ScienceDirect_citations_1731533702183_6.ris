AB  - The introduction of Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) specifications to air traffic management has resulted in many benefits during nominal operations, including shorter flight paths, reduced fuel costs, and improved terminal area arrival rates. However, these benefits become less noticeable during off-nominal operations where aircraft are routinely interrupted from staying on PBN procedures due to disturbances such as missed approaches. This human-in-the-loop (HITL) study used multiple types of disturbance events to perturb the arrival schedule. Perturbed schedules were managed with different types of schedule adjustments, including a condition with no adjustments. The study collected data on a host of dependent variables, including human factors measures on controller workload and system performance measures such as schedule nonconformance (nc). Initial analyses showed strong correlations between aggregated controller workload and aggregated nc, as well as benefits of both automatic and manual schedule adjustments for increasing system performance, such as reduced PBN procedure interruptions. The goal of this paper is to further test these initial findings. The results indicated that an increase in schedule nonconformance correlated with an increase in controller workload at specific time intervals, and automated schedule adjustments consistently reduced controller workload associated with nonconformance.

AB  - Real-time monitoring and analysis of human operator’s mental workload (MWL) is crucial for development of adaptive/intelligent human-machine cooperative systems in various safety/mission-critical application fields. Although data-driven machine learning (ML) approach has shown promise in MWL recognition, it is usually difficult to acquire sufficient labeled data to train the ML model. This paper proposes semi-supervised extreme learning machines (SS-ELM) for MWL pattern classification using solely a small number of labeled data. The experimental data analysis results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ELM paradigm to effectively exploit a large number of unlabeled data for the real-world 3- or 4-class MWL classification problem.

An overview of the architectures, functions and algorithms of aircraft-type aerospace vehicles equipped with fly-by-wire (FBW) digital integrated control systems (ICS) is given. The ICS has a hierarchical architecture, including the primary, backup and emergency control systems with a sophisticated control reconfiguration logic in the event of failures. Digital control computers have dissimilar redundancy of equipment and software. At the atmospheric flight stage, integrator control laws provide the specified control characteristics, flight envelope protection, automatic trim of vehicle and crew workload alleviation. Further integration of manual and automatic control, implementation of the control philosophy as a continuation of the pilot's actions, more intellectual control system and human-machine interface, use of multiple control surfaces to ensure optimal vehicle configuration and alleviate structural loading together with basic control functions are considered as promising areas for ICS improvement.

AB  - In various real life applications job processing times are controllable through the allocation of a limited resource. To date research has been conducted under the assumption that the relationship between the amount of resource allocated to a job and its processing time is independent of the number of tasks processed previously. However, there exist many manufacturing and service systems where workers and machines acquire, develop and refine skills through the repetition of identical or similar operations. In this paper we consider a scheduling model where job processing times are a convex function of the amount of resource they are allocated. In addition, we assume that the parameters of this function are position-dependent, i.e., vary with the job׳s position in the sequence. This assumption reflects general processes of learning or aging, or a combination of both. We first focus on a single machine setting and the makespan and total flowtime criteria. We show that the combined problem of finding an optimal job sequence and an optimal resource allocation can be solved in O(n3) time. We show that our algorithm can be used to address a bicriteria objective comprising of a linear combination of makespan and the total flowtime criteria on a single machine. We then extend the results to a parallel machine setting for the total flowtime criteria.

AB  - Background
The locus coeruleus (LC) signals salience to sensory stimuli and these responses can modulate the experience of pain stimuli. The pupil dilation response (PDR) to noxious stimuli is thought to be a surrogate for LC responses, but PDR response to Peltier-controlled noxious heat stimuli, the most commonly used method in experimental pain research, has not been described.
New method
Healthy volunteers were presented with randomly presented heat stimuli of 5 sec duration and provided pain intensity ratings to each stimulus. Pupillometry was performed and a method developed to quantify the PDR relevant to these stimuli. The stimulus response, reliability, and effect of commonly used manipulations on pain experience were explored.
Results
A method of artifact removal and adjusting for lag from stimulus initiation to PDR response was developed, resulting in a close correlation between pain intensity rating and PDR across a large range of heat stimuli. A reliable assessment of PDR within an individual was achieved with fewer presentations as heat stimulus intensity increased. The correlation between pain rating and PDR was disrupted when cognitive load is increased by manipulating expectations or presenting a second pain stimulus.
Comparison with existing methods
The PDR began later after skin heating than electrical stimuli and this is the first examination of the PDR using standard nociceptive testing and manipulations of expectations and competing noxious stimulation.
Conclusions
A method is described applying PDR to standard heat nociceptive testing, demonstrating stimulus response, reliability, and disruption by cognitive manipulation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of eccentric workloads generated by a powered rowing machine on the cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. It was hypothesized that beneficial physiological effects would result by training with high eccentric workloads. Conventional rowing machines are utilized for performance improvements through concentric workloads alone; however for this research, a conventional machine was modified with an electric motor and an advanced control system to allow the machine to also include eccentric capabilities. The ability to combine concentric and eccentric actions in any exercise has the potential to improve training effectiveness. The study followed an experimental design, exposing ten subjects (5 male, 5 female) to multiple eccentric workloads generated by the powered rowing machine. Each subject participated in two 12-min exercise trials corresponding to full body row (FBR) and low body row (LBR). Each of these trials included four 3-min stages that gradually increased the eccentric workload. Increased eccentric muscle contractions and metabolic cost were confirmed in the experiments. The results on oxygen consumption reveal a significant increase between stages 1 and 2 for both exercises (FBR p=0.0001 and LBR p=0.004) with no significant increases between the remaining stages. Results on heart rate reveal a significantly increase with each stage for both exercises (p<0.05). Results on muscle activation also reveal an overall increase for all muscle groups as eccentric workload is increased.

AB  - In this study, we consider the manufacturing process of cable ducts, which is one of the main manufacturing steps of the train wagon (or car) manufacturing. These ducts provide cover for electrical cables in the rail cars. Manufacturing of cable ducts involves cutting and welding of aluminum sheets in welding and cutting shops, respectively. There is a bottleneck between cutting and welding workshops due to the different production speeds and inadequate capacity planning for the operators and machines. We aim to provide solutions to decrease the cycle time in an efficient and sustainable manner through resource sharing between departments. Therefore, to efficiently use the resources and balance the workload, we examine the benefits of utilizing Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) in the manufacturing facility. The problem is simulated in ProModel based on real manufacturing data. The current manufacturing environment and the scenario in which CPPS is utilized are compared in terms of machine utilization rates and cycle time. According to the simulation results, the utilization rates of the resources are increased, and the cycle time of cable duct production is decreased once the CPPS is utilized.

AB  - Driving is a high-demanding task, related to human capacity, required performance and events occurring in the external environment. Mental workload depends on numerous factors: task difficulty, task complexity, level of traffic, additional activities required by the driving action or imposed by the driver, the contextual conditions, as well as the individual response to stress. The study of driver's workload is crucial in guiding future car design, in order to improve the user experience, comfort as well as driving performance and safety. Indeed, if task demands are too high in relation to the user's capabilities, errors may occur and may become critical for safety. The present paper defines a transdisciplinary approach based on monitoring the driver's workload during driving tasks in order to map the perceived user experience, and finally understand the interaction between the driver and the car systems. The approach is based on three layers: the human conditions to detect, the vital parameters to be monitored, and the adopted monitoring technologies. The paper proposes: a protocol to monitor the driver's workload during both real and simulated tasks, a technological set-up including physiological and performance data collection, and a proper data elaboration strategy. The key findings are: the selection of the most relevant subjective and objective parameters to measure the driver's mental workload, the definition of a preliminary technological set-up for monitoring the workload during simulated driving, and the evaluation of the effects of task complexity and of a secondary task on driver's performance. The research paved the way to further studies about how to miniaturize and embed sensors inside the car for a less intrusive application during real driving. Results can also be used to assess the interaction with car devices and to compare different design alternatives.

AB  - Cognitive planning, the ability to develop a sequenced plan to achieve a goal, plays a crucial role in human goal-directed behavior. However, the specific role of frontal structures in planning is unclear. We used a novel and ecological task, that allowed us to separate the planning period from the execution period. The spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG recordings showed that planning induced a progressive and sustained increase of frontal-midline theta activity (FMθ) over time. Source analyses indicated that this activity was generated within the prefrontal cortex. Theta activity from the right mid-Cingulate Cortex (MCC) and the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) were correlated with an increase in the time needed for elaborating plans. On the other hand, left Frontopolar cortex (FP) theta activity exhibited a negative correlation with the time required for executing a plan. Since reaction times of planning execution correlated with correct responses, left FP theta activity might be associated with efficiency and accuracy in making a plan. Associations between theta activity from the right MCC and the left ACC with reaction times of the planning period may reflect high cognitive demand of the task, due to the engagement of attentional control and conflict monitoring implementation. In turn, the specific association between left FP theta activity and planning performance may reflect the participation of this brain region in successfully self-generated plans.

Eye-movement metrics and subjective workload measures are extensively used to determine mental workload of participants. The aim of this study was to assess Electric overhead travelling (EOT) crane operators’ mental workload variability based on eye movement metrics such as fixation frequency, fixation duration, saccade duration, saccade amplitude, and fixation/saccade ratio during EOT crane operations in virtual reality (VR) based EOT crane simulator.
Methods
A 2k (k = 3) factorial experiment with factors namely, hazardous scenario, activity level, and trial was designed and conducted to demonstrate the proposed assessment approach. Throughout the experiment, we recorded the eye movements of 12 EOT crane operators of a steel industry of authors’ country. Post experiment, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) was adopted as a subjective workload measure and run time of task completion was recorded. Eye-movement metrics, subjective workload measure, run time were tested with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and three way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Results
At the level of α = 0.05, the experimental factors significantly influence the means of eye movement metrics, subjective ratings and run time. There was also significant influence among their interactions. A positive correlation was also found for eye movements metrics with NASA-TLX and run time.
Conclusions
Eye movement metrics help in understanding the mental workload of participants unobtrusively and continuously. Analysis of subjective workload measure and run time along with eye-gaze analysis provide a deeper understanding on the pattern of mental workload.

Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) must maintain a consistently high level of human performance in order to maintain flight safety and efficiency. In current control environments, performance-influencing factors such as workload, fatigue and situation awareness can co-occur and interact to affect performance. However, multifactor influences and the association with performance are under-researched. This study utilized a high fidelity human in the loop en-route air traffic control simulation to investigate the relationship between workload, situation awareness and ATCO performance. The current study aimed to replicate Edwards, Sharples, Wilson and Kirwan’s (2012) previous research, and extend the study by using a ex-controllers as participants, and comparing multifactor relationships across four levels of automation. Results suggest that workload and situation awareness may interact to produce a compound impact on controller performance. In addition, the effect of the interaction on performance may be dependent on the context and level of automation. Findings have implications for human-automation teaming in air traffic control, and the potential prediction, and therefore support, of ATCO performance.

AB  - Workload is the most critical element to be evaluated in the design of a new system or interface because it generally tends to be closely connected with an operator's overall performance. However, few existing simulation models are able to cover the major sources of workload or simulate the time pressure effect on information processing and workload. In this study, a mathematical model to quantitatively compute the multiple sources of workload with a cognitive architecture, Adaptive Control of Thought – Rationale (ACT-R), is proposed, which at the same time reflects the effect of time pressure. Specifically, mathematical equations were developed to quantify each subscale of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the time pressure effect on information processing speed. The proposed method not only successfully estimates each subscale of NASA-TLX but also simulates the change of human performance and workload by time pressure, comparing the simulated values by the proposed method to performance time by the experiment and subjective ratings of NASA-TLX, as measured by participants on an experiment in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air Traffic Control (KA-ATC) task. There is also a discussion about further usage and implementation of this method in designing a complex system or interface. Practicably speaking, in domains of complex system or interface design, the proposed method can be used to quantitatively estimate the operator's workload and comprehend where the operator workload is concentrated early on, in the design phase.

AB  - Through an ergonomic approach, this study aimed to evaluate whether workers involved in forest harvesting activities in rural properties are subject to the development of work-related diseases, as well as their consequences. A cross-sectional study with 267 forest workers in rural properties in the Brazilian Central region was used. The following evaluations were performed for each of the activities (felling, delimbing, tracing, manual extraction and manual loading): physical workload evaluation; biomechanical evaluation; risk of repetitive strain injuries/work-related musculoskeletal disorders; environmental noise and vibration factors, where relevant, and thermal overload through the Wetbulb Globe Temperature index. The results showed that in general the physical workload was very high, exceeding the cardiovascular load limits and adding to the need for work reorganization. All activities exposed workers to serious and imminent risks of developing injuries to the spine and lower limbs. Likewise, in general the risk of the appearance of RSI/WMSDs was very high for all activities evaluated. Such results are due to the combination of organizational work factors and factors of the work environment such as exposure to bad weather, uneven terrain, lifting and handling loads above tolerable limits, excessive noise and thermal overload. All of this allows to conclude that ergonomic risks and workers’ health hazards in forest harvesting in rural properties are latent and very worrying, and that these workers are exposed to a form of labor exploitation that invariably leads to physical and emotional exhaustion and therefore to their decreased labor capacity and useful working life.

This paper studies the measurement indicators of nursing workload in neurology department, discusses the development and development law of nursing workload, provides scientific basis for nursing staff deployment, and guarantees high-quality and safe nursing services.
Methods
By using time series algorithm model, the paper calculates the nursing workload of neurology department and establishes the measurement index of nursing workload of neurology department. Improve the nursing workload information system, automatically generate and extract daily nursing workload, and construct a time series model of daily nursing workload.
Results

Results
The best fit models of the time series of the two wards in neurology department were both exponential smoothing models. The predictive value of the ward A smoothing model for the total nursing workload from January 1 to 3, 2014 was 317.39. 316.14, 295.94 points (upper limit: 366.39, 375.95, 364.88 points; lower limit: 268.40, 256.33, 227.00 points). The prediction value of the B Ward Index Smoothing Model for the total nursing workload from January 1 to 3, 2014 is 450.03, 449.38, 445.58 points (upper limit: 503.76, 512.04, 515.05 points; lower limit: 396.30, 386.71, 375.11 points).
Conclusion
Time series analysis can predict the nursing workload on the one hand, and adjust the number of nurses on the day of work according to the short-term predicted value of the nursing workload on the time series model; on the other hand, it can evaluate the rationality of the existing manpower allocation strategy.

Rapid growth in data, maximum functionality and changing behavior tends the database workload to be more complex and tricky. Each DBMS experiences complex workloads that are difficult to manage by the humans; human experts take much time to manage database workload efficiently; even in some cases it may become impossible and leads toward malnourishment. This problem leads database practitioners, vendors and researchers toward new challenges. To achieve a satisfactory level of performance, either Database Administrator (DBA) or DBMSs must have the knowledge about the workload shifts. Efficient execution and resource allocation of workload is dependent on the workload type that may be either On Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support System (DSS). The research introduces a way to manage the workload in DBMSs on the basis of the workload type. The main goal of the research is to manage the workload in DBMSs through characterization, scheduler and idleness detection modules. The database workload management is performed by using the case based reasoning characterization; Fuzzy logic based scheduling and finally detection of CPU Idleness. Results are validated through experiments that are performed on real time and benchmark workload to reveal effectiveness and efficiency.

AB  - Mental Workload (MW) has become an important problem in the design of man-machine systems, so its related detection and analysis technology has aroused extensive interest and concern. Researches show electrocardiogram (ECG) physiological signals can be an appropriate indicator to reflect the level of human MW. When the operator is in the state of high MW, the cardiac load will increase, and the period and shape of ECG signals accordingly change. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the most widely used ECG feature to assess the MW. However, its classification precision is not high enough. In order to improve this, multiple features of ECG signals are extracted to classify the MW in this paper. Besides the RR interval feature of HRV, the other three features, T and P wave power, QRS complex power and Sample Entropy (SampEn) of ECG waveform, are further extracted and applied to assess MW. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to establish the classification model, and the grid search and cross-validation algorithm are used to optimize its parameters. The results show the MW classifier based on multiple features of ECG signals can evidently improve the classification accuracy. This will be helpful to realize a real time and online MW classification using ECG data.

AB  - Abstract:
In this study, a human cognitive control mode to determine human reliability is estimated using data obtained by eyewear called JINS MEME. This device can measure electro-oculography, acceleration, and angular rate without load on the subject. The computer game widely known as TETRIS is selected as a test task because the task difficulty affecting the subjects’ workload can be controlled by varying game speed. NASA-TLX is utilized to measure the subjective mental workload of 12 subjects. First, the blink rate measured by JINS MEME focusses as a parameter to reflect mental workload. Consequently, 10 out of 12 subjects show negative correlation between blink rate and NASA-TLX score. Thus, basic validity using this device to estimate mental workload is confirmed. Second, a machine algorithm, i.e., a support vector machine (SVM), is applied to the measured data to categorize the subject’s conditions into either Normal or Degraded. Additional parameters measured by JINS MEME are introduced as input data to the SVM. It is demonstrated that the SVM can categorize the subjects’ conditions with 80-90% accuracy, and that the reduction of input variables using principle component analysis results in higher categorization accuracy.

AB  - The human capability to learn new motor skills depends on the efficient engagement of cognitive-motor resources, as reflected by mental workload, and psychological mechanisms (e.g., self-efficacy). While numerous investigations have examined the relationship between motor behavior and mental workload or self-efficacy in a performance context, a fairly limited effort focused on the combined examination of these notions during learning. Thus, this study aimed to examine their concomitant dynamics during the learning of a novel reaching skill practiced throughout multiple sessions. Individuals had to learn to control a virtual robotic arm via a human-machine interface by using limited head motion throughout eight practice sessions while motor performance, mental workload, and self-efficacy were assessed. The results revealed that as individuals learned to control the robotic arm, performance improved at the fastest rate, followed by a more gradual reduction of mental workload and finally an increase in self-efficacy. These results suggest that once the performance improved, less cognitive-motor resources were recruited, leading to an attenuated mental workload. Considering that attention is a primary cognitive resource driving mental workload, it is suggested that during early learning, attentional resources are primarily allocated to address task demands and not enough are available to assess self-efficacy. However, as the performance becomes more automatic, a lower level of mental workload is attained driven by decreased recruitment of attentional resources. These available resources allow for a reliable assessment of self-efficacy resulting in a subsequent observable change. These results are also discussed in terms of the application to the training and design of assistive technologies.

AB  - Two opposing views define the debate on the moral principles underlying human behavior. One side argues a central role for five moral foundations (care, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity), while the other argues that two of these (care, fairness) capture the essence of human moral concerns. In an experiment comparing these two views, Wright and Baril (2011) found that conservatives under cognitive load devalue loyalty, authority and sanctity, and become more liberal. Their finding of common intuitive concern with care and fairness supports the two-foundation perspective. In two high-powered preregistered experiments (N = 3275), we used time-pressure to induce intuitive thinking and tested Wright and Baril's finding that “we are all liberals at heart.” Although the manipulations worked as intended, Study 1 failed to identify an effect on the moral foundations questionnaire (MFQ). We conjectured that familiarity with standard survey items may weaken intuition manipulations by eliciting stable opinions. In Study 2, we therefore used not only the MFQ but also novel moral foundations vignettes. Study 2 failed to find an effect of time-pressure on either questionnaire type. An internal Bayesian meta-analysis indicated strong evidence against an effect of intuitive thinking on moral foundations.

AB  - Alongside human factors, contextual factors are believed to have an ongoing and complex impact on driving outcomes. However, how and to what extent the components of context influence driving outcomes (e.g. rule violations, crash, stress, fatigue) are far beyond full understanding. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density on driving outcomes. Thirty-six volunteers were enrolled to participate into a driving simulator-based experiment. Each participant was required to complete twelve trials of simulated driving under different sets of scenarios. Driving outcome was measured by five dependent variables: frequency of speeding, frequency of lane deviations, number of correct sign recognition, completion time and workload. The results showed the frequency of speeding was significantly affected by weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density. Lighting condition had a significant effect on number of correct sign recognition. Weather condition, lighting condition and traffic density had significant effects on task completion time. Weather condition and lighting condition had significant effects on driver’s workload. The implications of the results could help traffic safety professionals better understand the risk factors that may lead to human errors during driving. Practically, countermeasures could be inspired and developed to mitigate the adverse impacts brought by driving context to minimum.

AB  - Measuring driver workload is of great significance for improving the understanding of driver behaviours and supporting the improvement of advanced driver assistance systems technologies. In this paper, a novel hybrid method for measuring driver workload estimation for real-world driving data is proposed. Error reduction ratio causality, a new nonlinear causality detection approach, is being proposed in order to assess the correlation of each measured variable to the variation of workload. A full model describing the relationship between the workload and the selected important measurements is then trained via a support vector regression model. Real driving data of 10 participants, comprising 15 measured physiological and vehicle-state variables are used for the purpose of validation. Test results show that the developed error reduction ratio causality method can effectively identify the important variables that relate to the variation of driver workload, and the support vector regression based model can successfully and robustly estimate workload.

AB  - Negation is an important concept in human language, yet little is known about children’s ability to comprehend negative sentences. In this paper, we explore how 2–5-year-old children’s comprehension of negation changes depending on the context in which a negative sentence occurs. We collected eye-tracking data while children watched a video in which they heard positive and negative sentences. Negative sentences, such as “look at the boy with no apples,” referred to a boy with nothing (Experiment 1) or a boy with an alternative object (Experiment 2). All children showed greater difficulty in resolving the referent when negative sentences referred to the boy with nothing, despite suggestions that nonexistence negations of this type are produced early in development. In addition, 3- and 4-year-old children showed an initial tendency to look away from the target and towards the named noun when the referent of the negative utterance was an alternative object. We argue that the processing of negation in young children is influenced by the cognitive demands of the pragmatic context in which the negative utterance occurs.

KW  - Traffic safety
AB  - Risks in maritime navigation linked to cyberthreats emerge, and they must be assessed together with the more traditional risks such as grounding or colliding another vessel, as now the latter might be the consequence of a cyberattack. The fields of mobility and transportation data see vulnerabilities of navigation systems jeopardising their normal use, and putting both users and their environment at risk. In this article, we propose a method based on expert knowledge for the risk assessment of cyberthreats in maritime transportation data. A specific focus is proposed on the AIS (Automatic Identification System), a world-wide message-based vessel localisation system that has demonstrated weaknesses allowing errors, falsification and spoofing of its transmitted data. The discovery of abnormal reporting cases is assessed by an expert-designed rule-based analysis frame resulting in the triggering of alerts and the assignment of risk levels, tailored to increase the awareness of the people in charge of monitoring the maritime traffic.

It plays an important role in the calculation of the bearing capacity, deformation calculation and physical and mechanical characteristics of the foundation soil. The purpose of this article is to solve the problems of tedious, inefficient and error-prone data collection, processing and analysis of geotechnical test data in the geotechnical and geological surveying industry of geotechnical engineering. By using the BP neural algorithm and selecting the intelligent algorithm, the SVM is used to solve the sample problem. The algorithm establishes an intelligent algorithm for geotechnical test data based on the Internet of Things. Then take the geological characteristics of the Ganjiang River Basin as an example, analyze the geotechnical test data to verify the feasibility of the intelligent algorithm for data analysis. The research results show that the algorithm realizes the automatic collection and processing of geotechnical test data, reduces the tester’s workload and the influence of human factors on the test results, makes up for the shortcomings of traditional acquisition algorithm hardware fixation, and solves the problem of simultaneous multitasking. Difficult problems have promoted the development of innovative experiments.

AB  - To estimate the reliability and cognitive states of operator performance in a human-machine collaborative environment, we propose a novel human mental workload (MW) recognizer based on deep learning principles and utilizing the features of the electroencephalogram (EEG). To determine personalized properties in high dimensional EEG indicators, we introduce a feature mapping layer in stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) that is capable of preserving the local information in EEG dynamics. The ensemble classifier is then built via the subject-specific integrated deep learning committee, and adapts to the cognitive properties of a specific human operator and alleviates inter-subject feature variations. We validate our algorithms and the ensemble SDAE classifier with local information preservation (denoted by EL-SDAE) on an EEG database collected during the execution of complex human-machine tasks. The classification performance indicates that the EL-SDAE outperforms several classical MW estimators when its optimal network architecture has been identified.

CPS applies the concept of workload leveling and finite capacity planning to assign orders to production lines by considering several production characteristics such as drying time, quantity splitting owing to the cutting pattern of the product type, and the variability of machine capacity threshold. CPS consists of five modules, namely, order treatment module (OTM), order priority module (OPM), lot release module (LRM), workload accumulation module (WAM), and workload balance module (WBM). The experimental design is used to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CPS with five factors (number of orders, order size, order size variance, order priority, and balance policy) with various levels and three response variables, namely, machine workload balance, order due date deviation, and lateness. Moreover, this result extends into finding the best settings of order priority and balance policy to generate the best favorable responses under the given three environment factors.

However, most models are limited to expert performance with rough adjustments to consider novices despite prior studies suggesting novices' cognitive, perceptual, and motor behaviors are different from experts. The objective of this study was to develop a cognitive performance model for novice law enforcement officers (N-CPM) to model their performance and memory load while interacting with in-vehicle technology. The model was validated based on a ride-along study with 10 novice law enforcement officers (nLEOs). The findings suggested that there were no significant differences between the N-CPM and observation data in most cases, while the results of the benchmark model were different from that of N-CPM. The model can be applied to improve future nLEO's patrol mission performance through redesigning in-vehicle technologies and training methods to reduce their workload and driving distraction.

AB  - In industrial Internet of Things (IoT) environments, sensor devices continue to generate a stream of sensor data, and the management of an ever-growing amount of data is a vital feature for IoT gateways. However, our preliminary analysis of some popular key–value stores used in IoT gateways revealed that none of the systems exploits the distinctive characteristics of IoT workloads – append-only and immutable – thus the systems show limitations in managing sensor data. To address this issue, in this study, we propose Indexing-of-Indexes (IoI) and LogFlush-and-Append (LFA) to exploit such characteristics. IoI is an indexing and data organization scheme designed to eliminate the notorious compaction-induced write amplification observed in legacy key–value stores, and LFA is a data ingestion scheme intended to remove double data write issues in legacy write-ahead logging implementations. We implement a prototype key–value store, Sen-Store, which incorporates our proposals, and we evaluate its performance using synthetic workloads and the TPCx-IoT benchmark. The evaluation results show that Sen-Store achieves up to 17.6× and 2.1× higher IoTps than industry-leading RocksDB and state-of-the-art IoTDB, respectively.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the distribution process of a manufacturing company that supplies products to the customers located in a service region. The company distributes its products partitioning the service region into delivery zones or districts that are served by a single deliveryman. Two objectives are considered when designing the delivery zones: balance the workload associated with each zone, and the minimization of the customers’ waiting times (latency). The former objective concerns a districting decision, and the latter objective is related to a routing decision. To support these planning decisions, an optimization framework based on a novel bi-objective optimization model is proposed. To approximate the frontier of non-dominated solutions of the bi-objective problem, an efficient heuristic algorithm inspired in the ε-constraint method is developed. The proposed algorithm exploits the characteristics of the problem, and it is used to solve a real case study. Obtained results are compared with the current solution employed by the company. Both objective function values are improved by any of the solutions in the approximated Pareto front. To show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, an additional set of instances derived from the case study is tested. The results indicate that the algorithm is able to approximate the Pareto fronts despite their shape. Hence, interesting managerial insights to improve the current decisions of the company are provided derived from the computational experiments.

AB  - Manufacturing planning and control systems ideally seek to simultaneously achieve short and predictable flow times as well as high output and due-date performance. One approach to address this problem is the workload control concept. It is based on the idea to control lead times by controlling order releases and thus the level of work-in-process and output. The focus of this paper is on multi-period optimization models for order release planning. We use a simulation study of a make to order manufacturer in a rolling horizon setting and compare the performance of an order release model that assumes fixed lead times and a model that allows for variable lead times: An input output control and a clearing function model, respectively. We analyze two different approaches to cope with the varying and tight due date slack and find that including more foreknowledge of demand is preferable. Finally, we show that the clearing function model outperforms the input output control model in all scenarios by yielding lower inventory levels with shorter shop floor throughput times. This advantage seems not to be affected by the predictability of the demand, but the IOC model narrows the gap when using near optimal parameters especially for a scenario with deterministic demand.

AB  - Mesh reflectors are uncertain structures due to manufacturing and assembly errors. Shape adjustment must be made to meet the surface precision requirement of space missions by changing the lengths of adjustable cables. It is desirable to find the optimum adjustment amount based on the current state of the actual prototype. However, it is hard to build an accuracy simulation model reflecting mechanical behavior of the actual prototype because only part information about the actual prototype can be measured. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with the parameter uncertainty of the actual prototype in order to provide a reliable structure state to guide the shape adjustment. This field has not been well studied because it involves an uncertainty analysis of parameters and the nonlinearity of high coupling of node displacements. To improve the efficiency of shape adjustment of uncertain mesh reflectors, this paper combines finite element model, actual prototype, and machine learning algorithm to develop a prediction model for precision analysis of the mesh reflector under multi-uncertainties using a machine learning algorithm (extreme gradient boosting), with the reflector surface node position as the input and the cable length adjustment amount required to displace it to a high precision surface as the output. First, based on the nominal design model, the sample data is collected by the Latin hypercube design method; the nonlinearity of the structure was taken into account by iterative solution during the data sampling, and the uncertain models containing different random errors are fused from the perspective of data sampling. The Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to obtain the optimal hyperparameters that enables strong generalization of the prediction model. Next, learning from the idea of K-nearest neighbor algorithm, the prediction model is updated based on the actual prototype data, which further improves the prediction ability of the current prototype to be adjusted. The incremental learning algorithm is used to reduce the time-consuming of the prediction model updating. Finally, numerical examples and experiments show that the proposed method has higher adjustment efficiency and precision with less workload.

AB  - Physical human-robot collaboration is increasingly required in many contexts (such as industrial and rehabilitation applications). The robot needs to interact with the human to perform the target task while relieving the user from the workload. To do that, the robot should be able to recognize the human's intentions and guarantee safe and adaptive behavior along the intended motion directions. The robot-control strategies with such attributes are particularly demanded in the industrial field, where the operator guides the robot manually to manipulate heavy parts (e.g., while teaching a specific task). With this aim, this work proposes a Q-Learning-based Model Predictive Variable Impedance Control (Q-LMPVIC) to assist the operators in a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) tasks. A Cartesian impedance control loop is designed to implement a decoupled compliant robot dynamics. The impedance control parameters (i.e., setpoint and damping parameters) are then optimized online in order to maximize the performance of the pHRC. For this purpose, an ensemble of neural networks is designed to learn the modeling of the human-robot interaction dynamics while capturing the associated uncertainties. The derived modeling is then exploited by the model predictive controller (MPC), enhanced with the stability guarantees by means of Lyapunov constraints. The MPC is solved by making use of a Q-Learning method that, in its online implementation, uses an actor-critic algorithm to approximate the exact solution. Indeed, the Q-learning method provides an accurate and highly efficient solution (in terms of computational time and resources). The proposed approach has been validated through experimental tests, in which a Franka EMIKA panda robot has been used as a test platform. Each user was asked to interact with the robot along the controlled vertical z Cartesian direction. The proposed controller has been compared with a model-based reinforcement learning variable impedance controller (MBRLC) previously developed by some of the authors in order to evaluate the performance. As highlighted in the achieved results, the proposed controller is able to improve the pHRC performance. Additionally, two industrial tasks (a collaborative assembly and a collaborative deposition task) have been demonstrated to prove the applicability of the proposed solution in real industrial scenarios.

AB  - We deal with the problem of cyclic scheduling tasks in the distributed manufacturing system with factories having the flow shop layout. The optimization aim is to minimize the cycle time. We have proposed the proprietary model and introduced some special properties of the problem, which allow us to find the cycle time for each given particular solution quickly. Since the formulated problem is NP-hard, we propose a metaheuristic algorithm based on the tabu search approach. The quality of the algorithm has been verified experimentally on common benchmarks and compared to other methods known in the literature, namely the scatter search and list scheduling. The problem also has a relation with the problem of balancing workloads of identical parallel production lines.

AB  - A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a network monitoring technology for identifying cyber attacks, botnet command and control traffic, and other unwanted network activity. Unfortunately, organizational NIDS solutions can often generate tens or hundreds of thousands of alerts on a daily basis, with a significant part of them having low importance or being false positives. Therefore, high priority alerts become hard to spot, which overloads security analysts and complicates their work. The current paper addresses this problem and introduces a machine learning framework for classifying NIDS alerts with the help of stream clustering and supervised learning. We propose a stream-clustering-guided method for creating labeled NIDS alert data sets. The small data sets created using this method can be used for training high-performance supervised NIDS alert classifiers. This significantly reduces the human labeling effort and eases the application of supervised machine learning for NIDS alert classification. The proposed machine learning framework was evaluated on NIDS alerts collected over 2 months from the network of a large academic organization. The experimental results indicate that combining stream clustering and supervised learning into a NIDS alert classification framework significantly decreases the number of false positives, and thus reduces the workload of human security analysts. The framework also features low CPU time and memory consumption and can thus be run on commodity hardware. In conclusion, the proposed framework provides a cost-effective means of integrating machine learning into Security Operation Centers (SOCs). This enables the identification of critical NIDS alerts using high-performance classifiers, thereby assisting in the automation of alert handling tasks for SOC personnel. To address the lack of public data sets in the problem domain and foster further research, we publicly share the large labeled NIDS alert data set used in our experimental setup.

AB  - With rapid availability of renewable energy sources and growing interest in their use in the datacenter industry presents opportunities for service providers to reduce their energy related costs, as well as, minimize the ecological impact of their infrastructure. However, renewables are largely intermittent and can, negatively affect users’ applications and their performance, therefore, the profit of the service providers. Furthermore, services could be offered from those geographical locations where electricity is relatively cheaper than other locations; which may degrade the applications’ performance and potentially increase users’ costs. To ensure larger providers’ profits and lower users’ costs, certain non-interactive workloads could be either: moved and executed in geographical locations offering the lowest energy prices; or could be queued and delayed to execute later (in day or night time) when renewables, such as solar and wind energies, are at peak. However, these may have negative impacts on the energy consumption, workloads performance, and users’ costs. Therefore, to ensure energy, performance and cost efficiencies, appropriate workload scheduling, placement, migration, and resource management techniques are required to mange the infrastructure resources, workloads, and energy sources. In this paper, we propose a workload placement and three different migration policies that maximize the providers’ revenues, ensure the workload performance, reduce energy consumption, along with reducing ecological impacts and users’ costs. Using real workload traces and electricity prices for several geographical locations and distributed, heterogeneous, datacenters, our experimental evaluation suggest that the proposed approaches could save significant amount of energy (∼15.26%), reduces service monetary costs (∼0.53% - ∼19.66%), improves (∼1.58%) or, at least, maintains the expected level of applications’ performance, and increases providers’ revenue along with environmental sustainability, against the well-known first fit (FF), best fit (BF) heuristic algorithms, and other closest rivals.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that alpha event-related desynchronization (α-ERD) is associated with reaction to visual stimuli in oddball paradigm, as a reflection of attention allocation and memory updating. The present study tested the hypothesis that it reflects a modality and/or frequency specific mechanism. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (64 channels) were performed on 18 healthy subjects during visual, auditory, somatosensory, and pain oddball paradigms. Low- and high-frequency α-rhythm were analyzed on individual basis, and their sources were estimated by low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). α-ERD, served as an index of cortical activation, was computed on the cortical voxel level and compared across the conditions (target vs. non-target), α sub-bands (lower vs. higher frequency), and modalities (visual, auditory, somatosensory, and pain). The results showed that visual α-ERD was mainly generated from occipital cortex for both target and non-target conditions. Its magnitude was enhanced across widespread cortical regions (e.g., bilateral occipital, parietal, and frontal areas) in the target condition and was greater in high-frequency α-band. Finally, α-ERD difference between target and non-target conditions was not higher in visual than that in other control modalities. All these findings indicated that human high-frequency α-ERD reflects cognitive attention processes underlying reaction to oddball target stimuli regardless of stimulus modality.

AB  - In the absence of a task, the human brain enters a mode of slow spontaneous fluctuations. A fundamental, unresolved question is whether these fluctuations are ongoing and thus persist during task engagement, or alternatively, are quenched and replaced by task-related activations. Here, we examined this issue in the human visual cortex, using fMRI. Participants were asked to either perform a recognition task of randomly appearing face and non-face targets (attended condition) or watch them passively (unattended condition). Importantly, in approximately half of the trials, all sensory stimuli were absent. Our results show that even in the absence of stimuli, spontaneous fluctuations were suppressed by attention. The effect occurred in early visual cortex as well as in fronto-parietal attention network regions. During unattended trials, the activity fluctuations were negatively linked to pupil diameter, arguing against attentional fluctuations as underlying the effect. The results demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations do not remain unchanged with task performance, but are rather modulated according to behavioral and cognitive demands.

AB  - Human-vehicle interaction in the presence of automated driving features (ADFs) poses significant challenges in behavioural adaptation. At the current level of automation, the mixed right-of-control of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) with partial human involvement is of interest. This study investigates the factors affecting the successful take over of the control by a human driver in the conditionally automated vehicle upon operational design domain (ODD) exit under different sociodemographic, mental workload, traffic flow, weather, and lighting conditions. Data collected in Virtual and Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE) are used to study the successful taking of control back from automated driving. Apart from estimating the binary and mixed logit models, a latent structure was developed to incorporate the attitudinal indicators in the integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model. Results indicate that almost 80 percent of participants were successful in safely regaining control. However, participants with more sensitive attitudes about CAV safety, were more likely to fail. Heavy congestion positively impacts situational awareness in taking back control safely from a CAV. Moreover, multi-tasking based on non-driving related secondary task (NDRT) engagement in a rainy night scenario, mental workload, and reaction time were significantly positive indicators of unsafe control transition. The statistics suggest that the driver's familiarity with the concept of CAVs is not enough for the safe transition of control.

AB  - Given the increasing complexity of construction tasks, and the growing number of construction operations within confined workplaces, construction workers rely heavily on working memory. In this context, working memory is defined as the short-term and temporary storage of information related to near future events to ensure the seamless execution of construction tasks. Although a strong relationship between engineering information format and task performance has been observed in the relevant literature, there remains an obvious theoretical disagreement—in particular, about the cognitive mechanisms for explaining why different information formats affect working memory development and retrieval in distinct ways. This study presents a human–subject experiment (n = 120) to examine the impact of information format on the performance of a pipe maintenance task, and the implications of cognitive costs in both working memory development (information encoding) and retrieval (information recalling). Participants were required to review the operational instructions for a pipe maintenance task for a short period, and then perform the task from memory. Participants were divided into four groups depending on the format of information they received: 2D isometric drawing of the plate heat exchanger with bulleted-text operational instructions (2D-simple group); 2D isometric drawing of the plate heat exchanger with rich-text operational instruction (2D-complex group); an interactive 3D model of the plate heat exchanger with bulleted-text operational instructions (3D group); or an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment with bulleted-text operational instructions (VR group). The results indicated that 3D and VR groups outperformed 2D-simple and 2D-complex groups in both operation time and maintenance accuracy. A further cognitive load analysis (based on surveys and pupil dilation) suggested that the superior performance of these groups is driven by more efficient usage of working memory, measured by how easily the encoded information can be recalled in the operation phase. Larger pupil dilation during encoding, indicative of successful working memory formation, was associated with better subsequent performance. These findings provide more evidence about cognitive mechanisms engaged by different information formats, help to resolve the current theoretical disagreement within the construction literature, and may inspire designs of cognition-driven information systems that can improve working memory in construction workers.

AB  - Alternative machines assignment, machine sharing, and inter-cell movements are very common yet difficult to be solved integratedly in modern dynamic Cellular Manufacturing Systems (CMS). In this paper, we incorporate these issues and consider a dynamic cellular scheduling problem with flexible routes and machine sharing. We employ a mixed integer programming scheduling model to minimize both the makespan and the total workload. To solve this new model, we propose a three-layer chromosome genetic algorithm (TCGA). We first compare the performances of the proposed TCGA with the optimal solution obtained by CPLEX. Computational results show that the TCGA performs well within a reasonable amount of time. We further compare our proposed TCGA with the classic genetic algorithm (GA) and the shortest processing time (SPT) rule through numerical experiments. The results reveal that the TCGA significantly improves the performance and effectively balances the workload of machines.

AB  - Resting State (RS) is the basic state of human consciousness. Many neural networks of the brain in RS interact with each other. The same activity can be observed with a difficult cognitive load. Thus, RS reflects the whole dynamics of consciousness. Data, recorded through two methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is generally used to image resting state network (RSN). The effective connection of RSN was visualized by fMRI, but the lack of this method is a poor temporal sensitivity. The MEG method makes it possible to get data with a good temporal resolution up to 1000 Hz. In this work we have analyzed the data, recorded at RS. Functional RSN, related to the motor and sensory regions of the brain, as well as the default and control networks, was identified. These functional networks were detected with the fMRI first, and are most well identified in the analysis of the BOLD signal.

AB  - Order picking is a labor-intensive and costly process in supply chains, which is performed manually in most cases. Recently, picking robots have been developed which are capable of working together with human pickers in a shared working space. Such hybrid order picking system can ease human pickers’ workload and provide ergonomic improvements, because it partially automates the order picking process. We propose a simulation model to measure the energy expenditure of human pickers who work with the support of picking robots. The hybrid order picking system is evaluated based on its operational costs, efficiency, and ergonomic characteristics. Preliminary results presented in this study show that there are assignment rules for items to workers and robots that reduce human energy expenditure and costs per pick, as well as maintain average throughput time at a certain level. The aim of this preliminary study is to closely analyze the hybrid order picking system, evaluate managerial implications, and detect research opportunities for future works.

AB  - Learning complex symbolic concepts requires a rich hypothesis space, but exploring such spaces is intractable. We describe how sampling algorithms can be brought to bear on this problem, leading to the prediction that humans will exhibit the same failure modes as sampling algorithms. In particular, we show that humans get stuck in “garden paths”—initially promising hypotheses that turn out to be sub-optimal in light of subsequent data. Susceptibility to garden paths is sensitive to the availability of cognitive resources. These phenomena are well-explained by a Bayesian model in which humans stochastically update a sample-based representation of the posterior over a compositional hypothesis space. Our model provides a framework for understanding “bounded rationality” in symbolic concept learning.

AB  - To meet increasing safety and performance demands in air traffic control (ATC), more advanced automated systems will be introduced to assist human air traffic controllers. Some even foresee complete automation, with the human as a supervisor only to step-in when automation fails. Literature and empirical evidence suggest that supervising highly-automated systems can cause severe vigilance and complacency problems, out-of-the-loop situation awareness and transient workload peaks. These impair the ability for humans to successfully take over control. In this study, situation awareness prompts were used as a way to keep controllers cognitively engaged during their supervision of a fully automated ATC system. Results from an exploratory human-in-the-loop experiment, in which eight participants were instructed to monitor a fully automated ATC system in a simplified ATC context, show a significant decrease in workload peaks following an automation failure after being exposed to high-level SA questions. Although the selected method did not necessarily yield improved safety and manual control efficiency, results suggest that using situation awareness feedback in line with controllers’ attention could be an avenue worth exploring further as a training tool.

AB  - To enhance visual information for the teleoperators of construction machines, we previously developed a video system that automatically controls the angle and zoom of multiple environmental cameras on the ground. However, in general, ground-fixed camera systems (GCS) have issues regarding the quality of the images, i.e., frequent image switching and insufficient viewpoint adjustment. Toward solving these problems, this study proposes a fundamental design method for a video presentation system using multiple flying cameras and investigates teleoperators' responses in terms of behavioral and mental aspects. The teleoperators need to rapidly understand the environment and precisely control the machine, so the video presentation system requires continuity to project consistent images by avoiding frequent changes in capturing parameters. It also requires complementarity between images to provide three-dimensional (3D) information with less mental rotation and translation. To investigate the feasibility of the framework of a multi-flying camera system (FCS), we implemented a prototype and ran experiments in which a construction machine in a virtual reality simulator moves over uneven terrain and carries objects. We found that FCS could reduce the work time and subjective workload and increase the subjective usability compared to a conventional GCS. Moreover, we could obtain the gaze distribution and view transition characteristics as well as their individual differences. These results will contribute to establishing a fundamental design method for FCS.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to have a positive impact on various sectors, such as manufacturing, users, and operators. Due to the capabilities of smart objects to share their contents and interact with their social networks, the combined Social Internet of Educational Things (SIoET) for smart education is expected to provide users with more efficient services. The primary objective of this paper is to provide an efficient resource management by adopting edge intelligence technique for higher education system workloads on next-generation networks. As the number of tasks handled by these interconnected devices continues to rise, there is an escalating concern regarding resource competition and power consumption within the network. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an innovative edge intelligence-based resource allocation approach to intelligently allocate resources while minimizing latency and optimizing power consumption with increasing task volumes. The problem is dissected into two core sub-problems: computation resource optimization and power optimization. Leveraging the concept of Lagrangian and Bisection methods, our proposed algorithm, implemented within a Device-to-Device (D2D) -assisted edge intelligence network, demonstrates remarkable performance improvements. Network latency and energy consumption is reduced by up to 57.9 % and 82.3 % compared to the benchmark schemes. These findings hold promising implications for the integration of this work into higher education systems driven by SIoET. Furthermore, simulations indicate that the system maintains robust performance even in dynamic urban environments characterized by random device movement.

AB  - The human factors and their interaction with other factors play an important role in the flight safety of transport aircraft. In this paper, a paradigm of risk assessment for transport aircraft interacting with piloting behaviors is proposed, with focus on landing which is the most accident-prone flight stage in aviation safety statistics. Model-based flight simulation serves as our data source for landing risk analysis under uncertainties. A digital pilot in the loop that reflects the human piloting behaviors is employed to facilitate simulation efficiency. Eight types of unsafe events in landing are identified from statistics. On this basis, the landing safety boundary is extracted via stochastic simulation to divide safety and hazardous flight status domains, which contributes to flight status management and risk warning. The simulation results indicate that appropriate piloting behavior, which is active response and fast target acquisition with minimum overshoot and fluctuation, shows benefit to landing safety. The subset simulation technique is employed to further refine the boundary with less computational workload. Furthermore, the effect of airspeed, windspeed, and other factors on landing risk is also discussed. The proposed risk assessment method would help optimize operation procedure and develop targeted pilot training program.

AB  - Semi-autonomous control strategies for prosthetic hands provide a promising way to simplify and improve the grasping process for the user by adopting techniques usually applied in robotic grasping. Such strategies endow prosthetic hands with the ability to autonomously select and execute grasps while keeping the user in the loop to intervene at any time for triggering, accepting or rejecting decisions taken by the controller in an intuitive and easy way. In this paper, we present a semi-autonomous control strategy that allows the user to perform fluent grasping of everyday objects based on a single EMG channel and a multi-modal sensor system embedded in the hand for object perception and autonomous grasp execution. We conduct a user study with 20 subjects to assess the effectiveness and intuitiveness of our semi-autonomous control strategy and compare it to a conventional electromyography-based control strategy. The results show that the workload is reduced by 25.9% compared to conventional electromyographic control, the physical demand is reduced by 60% and the grasping process is accelerated by 19.4%.

AB  - We discuss a planning model with load-dependent lead times for making order acceptance decisions in multi-product, multi-stage manufacturing systems. Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) belong to this class of manufacturing systems. A profit-based objective function is considered. Clearing functions are used in the planning formulation to correctly represent the lead time behavior in the case of a congested system. Order acceptance decisions are made with respect to flexible due dates, i.e., it is possible to reject certain orders if there is not enough capacity. Such acceptance decisions are important, for instance, in short-term demand supply matching algorithms that are crucial for demand fulfillment and available to promise decisions in semiconductor manufacturing. The resulting planning problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. We first show that the resulting planning problem is NP-hard. Hence, computationally tractable approaches must be designed. Therefore, variable neighborhood search is hybridized with linear programming to solve large-sized problem instances in reasonable amount of computing time in the present paper. Results of computational experiments for problem instances that are derived from a scaled-down wafer fab simulation model are provided and analyzed. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed matheuristic outperforms time-based decomposition approaches from the literature.

AB  - Conventional Air Traffic Control is still predominantly being done by human Air Traffic Controllers, however, as the traffic density increases, the workload of the controllers increases as well. Especially for the area of unmanned aviation, driven by the rise in drones, having human controllers might become unfeasible. One of the methods that is currently being investigated for replacing the conflict resolution task of Air Traffic Control is Reinforcement Learning. As violation of the required separation margins, also called an intrusion, is an event of relatively low frequency, using Reinforcement Learning for this task comes with difficulties that can potentially be attributed to data imbalance. This paper artificially increased the traffic density during the training phase of the Reinforcement Learning method to investigate what the importance is of a balanced data set on the performance of the Reinforcement Learning method. It was found that as the traffic density increased, the Reinforcement Learning methods started to outperform the analytical methods. Beyond this it was found that methods trained at higher traffic densities, but tested at lower traffic densities, outperformed the methods trained at that specific density. This indicates that it might be better to always ensure that the training scenarios are more complex than anticipated during the execution phase, even if that results in unrealistic scenarios.

AB  - With the development of society and technology, the modern manufacturing system is required to handle unpredictable and rapidly changing market demands during various demand periods. This is a new challenge to the production scheduling of the production line, which requires a faster and smarter response to changes in production demand. To meet the challenge, the reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) has emerged as a competitive and promising manufacturing model. The reconfigurable assembly system (RAS), a critical feature of RMS, can be seamlessly incorporated into multi-variety, variable-batch, multi-functional, and fast-delivery manufacturing modes, opening up the possibility of rapid changes for production scheduling. In this paper, we first build a RAS model that can more accurately represent scheduling problems that may occur in real-world industrial operations. More specifically, we consider the assembly process of products could be divided into a number of major steps which are performed in different stations and optimize the assembly sequence of products and the equipment selection within individual assembly stations. After that, three objective functions corresponding to the workload balance, reconfiguration/assembly cost, and lead time are proposed to jointly optimize the assembly sequence and the equipment selection in individual assembly stations. Finally, a hybrid particle swarm optimization (MOHPSO) method is utilized to solve the multiple-objective optimization problem, which combines the advantages of particle swarm optimization and the hybrid method. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed MOHPSO method over other alternatives including MOPSO and NSGA-II, achieving lower Spacing Metric (SM) and Mean Ideal Distance (MID) indexes and is suitable for solving production scheduling problems.

AB  - Background
To examine data quality and reproducibility using ISTHMUS, which has been implemented as the standardized MR spectroscopy sequence for the multi-site Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) study.
Methods
ISTHMUS is the consecutive acquisition of short-TE PRESS (32 transients) and long-TE HERCULES (224 transients) data with dual-TE water reference scans. Voxels were positioned in the centrum semiovale, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral thalamus regions. After acquisition, ISTHMUS data were separated into the PRESS and HERCULES portions for analysis and modeled separately using Osprey. In vivo experiments were performed in 10 healthy volunteers (6 female; 29.5±6.6 years). Each volunteer underwent two scans on the same day. Differences in metabolite measurements were examined. T2 correction based on the dual-TE water integrals were compared with: 1) T2 correction based on the default white matter and gray matter T2 reference values in Osprey and 2) shorter WM and GM T2 values from recent literature.
Results
No significant difference in linewidth was observed between PRESS and HERCULES. Bilateral thalamus spectra had produced significantly higher (p<0.001) linewidth compared to the other three regions. Linewidth measurements were similar between scans, with scan-to-scan differences under 1 Hz for most subjects. Paired t-tests indicated a significant difference only in PRESS NAAG between the two thalamus scans (p=0.002). T2 correction based on shorter T2 values showed better agreement to the dual-TE water integral ratio.
Conclusions
ISTHMUS facilitated data acquisition and post-processing and reduced operator workload to eliminate potential human error.

AB  - To develop an efficient nonverbal human computer interaction system it is important to interpret the user's implicit intention, which is vague. According to cognitive visuo-motor theory, the human eye movements are a rich source of information about the human intention and behavior. According to Beatty's study, a task-evoked pupillary response is a consistent index of the human cognitive load and attention. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for a human's implicit intention recognition based on the eyeball movement pattern and pupil size variation. Based on the Bernard's research, we classify the human's implicit intention during a visual stimulus as informational and navigational intent. In the present study, the navigational intent refers to the human's idea to find some interesting objects in a visual input without a particular goal while the informational intent refers to the human's aspiration to find a particular object of interest. The proposed model utilizes the salient features of the eye such as fixation length, fixation count and pupil size variation as the inputs to classify the human's implicit intention. The experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve plausible recognition performance.

AB  - This paper reports on research carried out in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) on the interaction between a human and a mobile device, in the specific case where a healthcare professional uses the mobile device to access a medical application. The quality of mobile user interface is crucial in the healthcare domain, as the attention of healthcare professionals is usually on the patient and not on the system, and so low-quality UIs may lead to critical medical errors. In this research, the quality-in-use measurement model (QiU-4-MUI) is used to empirically investigate the impact of HCI principles on the quality of an MUI, in terms of five important characteristics, namely, effectiveness, productivity, efficiency, error safety, and cognitive load. The work investigates the applicability of these quality characteristics as indicators of the impact on user interface design of HCI principles, such as mental model, metaphor, feedback, affordance, and visibility. A controlled experiment was carried out among 23 doctors in a hospital environment to empirically investigate the impact of HCI principles on the quality in use of a mobile user interface, in terms of the QiU-4-MUI characteristics and in the healthcare context.

AB  - The improved control interface designs in nuclear power plants (NPPs) have been constantly developed in order to satisfy actual requirements. In this article, the effect of user interface layout on mental workload (MWL) of operators in emergency operating procedures in NPPs is analyzed. The control circuit interface of the Chemical and Volume Control system (RCV) was redesigned based on some human factor criterions and it was compared to the original interface during the procedure of system boots. The multi-index evaluation method based on performance measures (i.e., time to complete and error rate), subjective rating (i.e., NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)) and physiological measure (i.e., eye movement) was used to evaluate MWL of operators. Twenty-two engineering students tested both interfaces in randomized order. The results showed that interface design has a significant effect on operators’ MWL. Specifically, the redesigned interface was rated significantly lower in overall workload, time to complete, and fixation indices, but higher blink rate. The results suggested that human factor criterions have a significant effect on operators’ MWL so they should be considered during designing of interface, and using of NASA-TLX tool and eye movement technique is useful for assessing of human-computer interface (HCI) designs in NPPs.

AB  - We investigated the impact of a spatialized audio display on response time, workload, and accuracy while monitoring auditory information for relevance. The human ability to differentiate sound direction implies that spatial audio may be used to encode information. Therefore, it is hypothesized that spatial audio cues can be applied to aid differentiation of critical versus noncritical verbal auditory information. We used a human performance model and a laboratory study involving 24 participants to examine the effect of applying a notional, automated parser to present audio in a particular ear depending on information relevance. Operator workload and performance were assessed while subjects listened for and responded to relevant audio cues associated with critical information among additional noncritical information. Encoding relevance through spatial location in a spatial audio display system--as opposed to monophonic, binaural presentation--significantly reduced response time and workload, particularly for noncritical information. Future auditory displays employing spatial cues to indicate relevance have the potential to reduce workload and improve operator performance in similar task domains. Furthermore, these displays have the potential to reduce the dependence of workload and performance on the number of audio cues.

AB  - Significant challenges in perception, prediction, and decision-making within self-driving systems remain inadequately addressed. Concurrently, the advancement of autonomous driving technologies reduces driver engagement, inadvertently eroding their proficiency. Integrating human cognitive flexibility and experiential insight with the machine’s precision and reliability offers a promising approach for the transitional phase towards fully automated driving. This study presents a human-machine collaboration approach to enhance the highly automated vehicles’ high-level flexibility and personalization attribute without the need for passengers’ prior driving experience. Firstly, we propose a tactical human–vehicle collaboration framework leveraging the hand-landmark extraction algorithm and augmented visual feedback. The proposed vision-based interface projects the gesture onto the ground and feeds it back to the driver through the augmented reality head-up display (AR-HUD) for intuitive interaction. The projection offers strategic decision-making guidance and planning recommendations for the vehicle. Utilizing these suggestions, the automation algorithm efficiently manages the remaining tasks, including collision avoidance and adherence to traffic regulations. This approach minimizes the driver’s engagement in routine driving tasks and negates the need for driving skills. Incorporating cooperative game theory, the methodology optimally balances personalization with system robustness. Finally, we compare our approach with conventional manual driving schemes that both can assist the self-driving car in avoiding unknown obstacles and reaching the personalized goal. Results demonstrate that the proposed decision-making and planning collaboration scheme significantly reduces human physical burdens without compromising driving performance and driver mental workloads.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience where computer-generated perceptual information is superimposed into the real-world environment. Most existing research in AR-based wayfinding has focused on the technological aspects of developing AR-based software or devices to realize navigation. No previous investigations have focused on understanding the impact of immersive augmented reality (IAR)–based systems on human wayfinding performance from the cognitive perspective. Aimed at investigating the influence of IAR-based systems on people’s cognitive map development and their subsequent wayfinding performance as well as the effect of using three-dimensional (3D) layout models in IAR environments in addition to superimposed guideposts, an experiment was carried out in a building with a complex floor plan. A total of 54 university students were evenly divided into three groups: a control group with no IAR assistance, a second group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes only superimposed guideposts, and a third group using an IAR-based navigation system that includes both guideposts and a 3D layout model. Each participant was asked to conduct a spatial exploration task in the environment, sketch a floor map based on their spatial cognition, and perform a wayfinding task to find eight specific locations in the building. An analysis of the participants’ performance and responses to a number of self-evaluation questionnaires collected in the experiment indicates that IAR technology can help people develop their cognitive maps more effectively and can substantially improve their wayfinding performance with a much lower workload. A second finding is that adding a 3D layout model can enhance the effect of an IAR-based navigation system in terms of cognitive map development. The findings from this research extend the existing knowledge about IAR-based navigation and further verify that AR technology has the potential to reduce human workload for cognitive tasks. The results also could support its more effective application in various scenarios that require assisted wayfinding and cognitive map training, such as emergency evacuation drills.

AB  - Balance performance have been shown to be influenced by footwear design characteristics and physiological workloads. This study was conducted to assess the impact of two military footwear, standard (STD) and minimalist (MIN) boots, on human balance before (PRE) and after (POST) a simulated military type, load carriage exercise. Twenty two male participants [age: 22.14 ± 2.68 years; height: 176.69 ± 6.82 cm; weight: 79.81 ± 9.70 kg] were tested for balance in bilateral and unilateral stances with and without challenging sensory information and using a star excursion balance test (SEBT). Center of pressure postural sway variables from different balance testing conditions and reach distances from SEBT, were analyzed using a 2(STD-MIN) x 2(PRE-POST) repeated measures analysis of variance. Results revealed significantly greater postural sway in the STD boot and in POST workload conditions. Decrements in balance can be attributed to boot design characteristics and muscular exertion due to the workload.

AB  - Production control policies for a make-to-order manufacturing system composed of several stages under uncertain demand are considered. Conducting order-specific operations at each stage can produce a variety of final products from the same raw material. The production quantity per period at a stage depends on the workload. To shorten lead times, it is permitted to start production at upstream stages without confirmed orders, hold semi-finished items within the system as make-to-stock, and then match orders to these items under the constraints of specifications and quantities. Eight make-to-stock policies are prepared by combining buffer selection rules, matching acceptance rules, and make-to-stock replenishment rules. Their performance is evaluated via computer simulation. In the case of relatively limited capacity, aggressively matching orders to make-to-stock items are preferable in terms of the average lateness of orders and the average inventory level of the make-to-stock items. A policy that loads carefully to avoid undesirable processing delay by calculating the workload and considers the planned order quantities explicitly obtain better results under increased production capacity.

AB  - The mental workload can be estimated by monitoring different mental states from neural activity. The spectral power of EEG and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are the two mediums for monitoring the mental states. In this paper, we estimate the workload during the multitasking mental activities of human subjects. The estimation of mental workload is done using the “STEW” dataset [16]. The dataset consists of two tasks, namely “No task” and “simultaneous capacity (SIMKAP)-based multitasking activity”. Different workload levels of two tasks have been estimated using the composite framework consists of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and deep neural network. GWO has been used to select optimized features related to mental activities. Other optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are generally slower compared to the convergence rate of GWO. A deep hybrid model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been proposed for the classification of workload levels. The proposed deep model achieves 86.33% and 82.57% classification accuracy for “No task” and “SIMKAP-based multitasking activity,” respectively. A judicious distinction between different workload levels at higher accuracy will essentially increase the performance of an operator, which effectively improves the efficiency of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) in industry offers opportunities to decrease design and production costs, maintain product quality and reduce the time needed to go from product concept to production. Due to its interactive nature, VR is also used for simulations of training sessions to communicate knowledge on assembly and maintenance processes. So far, there are hardly any scientific findings on the effectiveness of virtual learning and training for industrial applications. It is also unclear how training can be improved in virtual environments to maximize the learning outcome. This article investigates whether VR-supported training leads to an increase in learning success compared to traditional training-on-the-job accompanied by a tutor. Two variations of a VR tool for the training of a simplified assembly processes were developed. A laboratory study with 64 participants was conducted to get an insight into the importance of virtual instructions and their effect on learning success and perceived workload. The results indicate that small modifications in a VR training application have a significant effect on learning outcome. In particular, a lower level of visual guidance can cause a higher level of mental workload during the training, forcing the user to actively deal with the learning content. Based on these findings, the opportunities and risks of current VR training simulations are discussed and recommendations to increase the learning effect are formulated.

AB  - Nowadays, many companies still operate without any process standardization in relation to short-term logistics management, which leads to a lack of control of both times and costs of logistical operations. This paper starts from a study that has been performed at a multinational corporation which manufactures fiber-reinforced plastic boxes and cabinets with doors, where the final product-storage area and the picking section frequently become overloaded. In addition, warehouse operators do not follow standardized procedures and usually carry out too many movements to complete their tasks. Finally, there is not a suitable daily logistics planning system to make sure that capacity and demand are in balance. This paper proposes a solution to this problem by means of a Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) study as well as a daily workload planner to control short-term logistical operations. Thanks to the implementation of this system, the company has been able to plan the day-to-day workload in an accurate way and to precisely determine the necessary resources for the picking and shipping orders. Moreover, the company has gained flexibility in order to better match demand and capacity and has experimented significant cost savings and a better delivery service to its customers.

AB  - In design of safety-critical and social-technical systems such as a nuclear power plant, practitioners are required to conduct a performance-based Integrated System Validation (ISV) test to verify that the system design could support the safe operation of the plant. Measurement of workload should be included. However, subjective workload measurements could not provide detailed information and continuous monitoring of the changing workload. This study compared physiological (heart rate difference, heart rate variability, respiration rate and breathing wave amplitude) and activity (number of walking steps, peak acceleration, activity level, and inclination) measures with workload defined as intensity of task demand and estimated with a task complexity measure in an ISV test. The test was conducted on a full-scale simulator using a beyond design-basis accident scenario. The results show that heart rate difference and respiration rate are positively correlated with the estimated workload, while heart rate variability and breathing wave amplitude are negatively correlated with the estimated workload. For operations using traditional panels, high workload is accompanied by larger number of walking steps, higher activity level, and smaller angles of inclination. It is suggested that continuous monitoring of cardiovascular, respiration, and activity measures can detect workload change during the ISV test. Relevance to industry: This study provides recommendations for continuous monitoring of workload during an ISV test of a nuclear power plant. The identified physiological and activity measures can be applied in detecting workload change. The findings are supportive in meeting regulatory requirements and improving system design in the nuclear domain.

AB  - Early Warning Aircraft (EWA) are the main force for air detection and its Human-Machine Interface (HMI) should be designed to support task efficiency and safety. With the application of advanced input method and interface design in EWA, little is known about their actual usability in terms of human factors and ergonomics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the input method and display mode of the situation map on EWA reconnaissance task performance with different information complexities. Eighteen participants attended a three-factor within-subject design experiment with input method (touch screen and mouse), display mode of the situation map (color and grayscale), and information complexity (high and low) as the independent variables. Participant behavior performance, subjective workload, heart rate/heart rate variability, and eye movements were recorded as the dependent variables. The results suggest that a touch screen requires greater task completion time and has greater physical demands than mouse operation; however, it also facilitates information processing by reducing the average fixation time. Color mode significantly decreases saccade counts compared to grayscale mode and is considered more appropriate for target search tasks as it induces less visual search load. High information complexity produces significant negative effects on behavior performance and subjective workload. It also has significant interaction effects with input method on fixation and saccade counts. The findings have implications in the optimization design of Human–Machine Interface for EWA task systems.

AB  - This paper proposes a simulation approach to estimate system reliability of a multi-state manufacturing network (MSMN) with joint buffers. The system reliability is an indicator to evaluate the probability that an MSMN can provide sufficient capacity to meet a given demand. From the perspective of industrial and systems engineering, the MSMN is constructed as a network topology in which each node denotes an inspection point and arcs denote workstations. In particular, joint buffers with finite volume are embedded in such a topology. Based on the topology, workload processed by each workstation is derived according to a given demand. Subsequently, a simulation approach is applied to randomly generate the current capacity state for the MSMN and to compute the buffer usage under such a state. System reliability is estimated after several iterations of simulation to check if the generated capacity state is available to process the workload or not. Besides, sensitivity analysis is adopted to investigate the most potential location to increase buffer volume. Two practical examples are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed simulation approach. Experimental results show that using joint buffers is more reliable than using parallel buffers in separated production lines.

AB  - ABSTRACT
3D concrete printing technology introduces automation to the construction industry. The wider build customizability is a great advantage of this technology, but it adds complexity to the mix design. The compositions formed are far more complex than in conventional concrete, increasing the difficulty in designing mixtures for 3D concrete printing. As the number of materials in mix design increases, the workload increases exponentially during the development process. In this study, optimization methods are employed to automate the development of mortar mixes. The three objectives are the improvement of workability, buildability, and compressive strength. Eight factors are investigated in total, with three being qualitative and five quantitative. Those factors include cement, sand, and superplasticizer types as well as the water-to-binder ratio, the sand-to-binder ratio, and admixtures dosages. An initial D-optimal set of 18 mixtures is formed to drastically reduce the number of experiments. Feedforward neural networks are used to predict the properties of new mixtures. To increase the accuracy of the models, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of each network. Finally, the Pareto-optimization algorithm is used to control the materials and their dosages with the aim of simultaneously optimising the values of the three objectives. The proposed multiobjective approach generated mixtures with improved properties that met all three criteria after only five iterations and twenty-one additional mixtures were formed. The results indicate that this methodology can reduce the required workload while generating mixture compositions with improved properties by following an optimum trend.

AB  - Fatigue induced by sustained cognitive demands often entails decreased behavioural performance and the unavailability of brain resources, either due to reduced levels or impaired access. In the present study, we investigated the neural dynamics underlying preserved behavioural performance after inducing cognitive fatigue (CF) in a sleep deprivation (SD) condition in which resources are naturally compromised. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we recorded cortical brain activity during task-related CF induction in the evening, in the middle of the night and early in the morning. Although cortical oxygenation similarly increased over the 3 sessions, decreased intra-hemispheric connectivity between left anterior frontal and frontal areas paralleled a sudden drop in task performance in the early morning. Our data indicate that decreased sustained attention after the induction of cognitive fatigue in a situation of high sleep pressure results from impaired connectivity between left prefrontal cortical areas rather than from a mere modulation in brain resources.

AB  - Ergonomic interventions may potentially reduce MSDs, but the context of industries (barriers, ever-changing situations, dialogue processes) might play a significant role in the success of interventions. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions including engineering/technical and organizational interventions, and the involvement of the stakeholders in reducing musculoskeletal risk factors/symptoms. A pre-post-test experimental study in non-randomized groups was performed over three years in a sector of a truck assembly plant. The mean age of the operators in the sector for the initial and second assessment time was 42.0 (±7.6) years and 39.0 (±8.7), respectively. The mean length of work experience in the current job was 15.2 (±7.2) years and 13.9 (±7.3) for the initial and second assessment times, respectively. Five engineering ergonomic solutions and organizational interventions were implemented after a comprehensive ergonomic analysis. The organizational interventions consisted mostly of transferring and redistributing the tasks, i.e., ergonomically balancing and redesigning of the workstations. Before performing the interventions, the findings of the ergonomic study were presented at several meetings to encourage the involvement of the stakeholders (including managers, engineers, and operators) in the interventions. This study showed that a combination of ergonomic measures—engineering and organizational interventions—could reduce physical workloads. Musculoskeletal symptoms decreased after interventions although the difference was not significant.

AB  - Cloud resources provide a promising way to efficiently perform the needed simulation tasks for a complex manufacturing process. Most of the existing work focuses only on how to effectively schedule computing resources to execute computing requirements of simulation workflows in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Research on the scheduling of simulation workflows in consideration of task ordering, service selection, and resource allocation altogether has not been lacking. To fill in this void, this paper proposes a cloud-based 3-stage workflow scheduling model. Before scheduling computing resources to complete task requirements, the order of the tasks is determined and the services that can meet the task requirements are selected. In this model, the workload to satisfy task requirements is not fixed and takes on a different value depending upon the service selected with its unique complexity and accuracy. An optimization function that transforms and integrates makespan, cost, and accuracy in a unique way is proposed. For its solution, the relatively new symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm is modified and two SOS-based optimization strategies are developed, i.e., joint optimization-based SOS (JOSOS) and split optimization-based SOS (SOSOS). The simulation results reveal that SOS-based algorithms, especially the SOSOS method, outperform all compared algorithms. Based on the proposed method, simulation services and computing resources can be rationally selected and scheduled to ensure the requirements of IoT applications.

AB  - The interest in mental workload (MWL) has strongly increased over the last 40 years in ergonomics and engineering studies. However, the subject is still very controversial and there is a debate on the dimensions to be considered for representing and estimating the workload. This paper reinvestigates the modeling of the mental workload concept, by combining the model of Hart and Staveland (1988), which considers this concept as a multidimensional construction, and the models of Sperandio (1971) and Leplat (2006), which focus on the regulation of the activity by the operator. This combination reveals new relationships between the different dimensions of MWL, and especially points out a means of measuring and understanding the effect of regulation on the workload. To validate this proposed approach to the modeling of MWL, an experiment is conducted on the dynamic activity of area monitoring based on the management of a swarm of drones.

AB  - Disassembly enterprises face significant challenges in managing increasingly intensive workloads with a workforce alone. To address this, current study focuses on balancing a human-robot collaborative disassembly line. For the task operator allocation problem, a mapping constraint mechanism between the disassembly tasks and the task operators is established based on the remanufacture demand and hazard characteristics of components. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated, encompassing four optimization objectives: the number of workstations, the task operator idle balancing index, the demand index, and the hazard index. A novel modified teaching and learning optimization approach is proposed for the addressed human-robot collaborative disassembly line balancing problem. A two-layer encoding strategy is designed based on the solving characteristics of the problem and an embedded perturbation strategy based on randomly transforming the task operator is introduced to enhance the optimization performance of the proposed method. The validity of the mixed-integer programming model and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through two small-scale human-robot collaborative disassembly case studies. The proposed algorithm is then applied to two real-life cases of human-robot collaborative disassembly lines with different scales. The results of the proposed optimization method are compared with other advanced algorithms, demonstrating its superior performance in both single-objective and multi-objective optimization based on multiple evaluation indicators.

AB  - Cascading high-amplitude bursts in neural activity, termed avalanches, are thought to provide insight into the complex spatially distributed interactions in neural systems. In human neuroimaging, for example, avalanches occurring during resting-state show scale-invariant dynamics, supporting the hypothesis that the brain operates near a critical point that enables long range spatial communication. In fact, it has been suggested that such scale-invariant dynamics, characterized by a power-law distribution in these avalanches, are universal in neural systems and emerge through a common mechanism. While the analysis of avalanches and subsequent criticality is increasingly seen as a framework for using complex systems theory to understand brain function, it is unclear how the framework would account for the omnipresent cognitive variability, whether across individuals or tasks. To address this, we analyzed avalanches in the EEG activity of healthy humans during rest as well as two distinct task conditions that varied in cognitive demands and produced behavioral measures unique to each individual. In both rest and task conditions we observed that avalanche dynamics demonstrate scale-invariant characteristics, but differ in their specific features, demonstrating individual variability. Using a new metric we call normalized engagement, which estimates the likelihood for a brain region to produce high-amplitude bursts, we also investigated regional features of avalanche dynamics. Normalized engagement showed not only the expected individual and task dependent variability, but also scale-specificity that correlated with individual behavior. Our results suggest that the study of avalanches in human brain activity provides a tool to assess cognitive variability. Our findings expand our understanding of avalanche features and are supportive of the emerging theoretical idea that the dynamics of an active human brain operate close to a critical-like region and not a singular critical-state.

AB  - Toolpath planning for Continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) 3D printing is a challenging task, which is vital to decrease the process complexity. In this paper, we propose a global continuous path planning method for CFRTPCs. First, for the set of 2D connected regions generated by slicing, we establish an optimized print sequence with a minimum idle stroke under interference constraints. Second, a continuous Zigzag path generation algorithm with controlled deposition direction is constructed for each 2D connected region, and path optimization is used to lessen the uneven deposition spacing. Finally, A separation axis theorem is used to prevent interference during the printing process, and we use a genetic algorithm to choose the connection points between 2D paths in a given spatial printing sequence to make the minimum idle stroke, creating a global continuous path with controllable deposition direction. The method proposed in this paper can provide the ability to customize the local deposition path direction and ensure the continuity of the global path to avoid interference and reduce the post-processing workload, so it is suitable for continuous path planning and multi-physics field optimization of complex structures, which can fully utilize the advantages of high-performance fibers to improve the customization ability and the performance of the fabricated parts for 3D printing and provide support for the manufacturing of high-performance structures in different fields.

KW  - Simulation-Optimization
AB  - This work studies the problem of lot sizing and scheduling of multiple products on a single machine, with stochastic demand and sequence-dependent setup times, called Stochastic Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (SELSP). The present work differs from others in the literature by considering simple inventory control policies and using the simulation–optimization approach to calibrate their parameters. We consider two inventory control policies: (i) fixed cycling (First in Sequence - FIS) and (ii) dynamic scheduling based on inventory levels (Lowest Days of Supply - LDS), combined with an “order-up-to” lot sizing. The problem is solved using AnyLogic simulation software and the OptQuest search engine to minimize total inventory cost (ordering, holding and shortage costs). The experimental design included the following factors: number of items, coefficient of variation of demand, system workload, and degree of setup increment, allowing the comparison of the two inventory control policies in different scenarios. Experiments show that LDS outperforms FIS in all scenarios, achieving up to 4.6% cost savings for cases of more products, higher workload, and greater demand variance. The developed models proved to solve the problem, effectively generating reasonable solutions. Furthermore, as they are user-friendly, we believe they can be adapted, without great difficulties, to real-life scenarios of the process industry.

AB  - This study proposes an operator support system that enhances understandability of multiple monitor for teleoperated disaster response robots. The autonomous environmental camera control system we previously developed could provide operators with various visual information suited to the situation. To enable operators to adequately recognize environmental situations, multiple camera images are projected on multiple monitors, but this may increase the cognitive load of operators. The proposed situational understanding enhancer thus supports selective visual attention, situational awareness, and action decision, based on augmented visual prompts (AVPs). To support both work facilitation and danger avoidance, the AVPs include (i) monitor frame, (ii) obscuration, (iii) end-point vertical arrow, and (iv) distance arrow, with variable color and flashing effect. The system adaptively draws visual attention by changing the types and parameters of the AVPs according to the situations. Debris-removal tasks were conducted using a virtual reality simulator to compare the systems with and without AVP support. The results showed that the AVP support reduced the frequent changes in point of gaze, provided a sense of depth, and drew attention to potential collisions.

AB  - This paper analyzes perceived workload and passivity-shortage of human operators for a class of semi-autonomous robotic swarms. First, we briefly introduce the passivity-short-based architecture presented in one of our previous works, which guarantees human-enabled motion synchronization to desired position/velocity references under the assumption that the human operator’s thought process is a passivity-short system. It is observed that changes in parameter affects the visual feedback to the operator and also the complexity of the setups. Through user-studies using a human-in-the-loop simulator and questionnaires, we observe an increase in the perceived workload of the human operator for more complex setups. The result imposes the trade-off for less workload vs. clarity of the robotic swarms’ information to the human operator. Furthermore, through non-parametric system identification on data from user-studies, it is observed that all obtained models of the participants have the passivity-short property.

AB  - Scalability is one of the utmost nonfunctional requirement of server applications, because it maintains an effective performance parallel to the large fluctuating and sometimes unpredictable workload. In order to achieve scalability, thread pool system (TPS) has been used extensively as a middleware service in server applications. The size of thread pool is the most significant factor, that affects the overall performance of servers. Determining the optimal size of thread pool dynamically on runtime is a challenging problem. The most widely used and simple method to tackle this problem is to keep the size of thread pool equal to the request rate, i.e., the frequency-oriented thread pool (FOTP). The FOTPs are the most widely used TPSs in the industry, because of the implementation simplicity, the negligible overhead and the capability to use in any system. However, the frequency-based schemes only focused on one aspect of changes in the load, and that is the fluctuations in request rate. The request rate alone is an imperfect knob to scale thread pool. Thus, this paper presents a workload profiling based FOTP, that focuses on request size (service time of request) besides the request rate as a knob to scale thread pool on runtime, because we argue that the combination of both truly represents the load fluctuation in server-side applications. We evaluated the results of the proposed system against state of the art TPS of Oracle Corporation (by a client-server-based simulator) and concluded that our system outperformed in terms of both; the response times and throughput.

AB  - Firefighters are often exposed to extensive wayfinding information in various formats owing to the increasing complexity of the built environment. Because of the individual differences in processing assorted types of information, a personalized cognition-driven intelligent system is necessary to reduce the cognitive load and improve the performance in the wayfinding tasks. However, the mixed and multi-dimensional information during the wayfinding tasks bring severe challenges to intelligent systems in detecting and nowcasting the attention of users. In this research, a virtual wayfinding experiment is designed to simulate the human response when subjects are memorizing or recalling different wayfinding information. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed for automated attention detection based on the power spectrum density of electroencephalography (EEG) data collected during the experiment. The performance of the personalized model and the generalized model are compared and the result shows a personalized CNN is a powerful classifier in detecting the attention of users with high accuracy and efficiency. The study thus will serve a foundation to support the future development of personalized cognition-driven intelligent systems.

AB  - Mobile robotic telepresence systems require that information about the environment, the task, and the robot be presented to a remotely located user (operator) who controls the robot for a specific task. In this study, two interaction modes, proactive and reactive, that differ in the way the user receives information from the robot, were compared in an experimental system simulating a healthcare setting. The users controlled a mobile telepresence robot that delivered and received items (medication, food, or drink), and also obtained metrics (vital signs) from a simulated patient while the users performed a secondary healthcare-related task (they compiled health records which were displayed to them on the screen and answered related questions). The effect of the two interaction modes on overall performance and user perception was evaluated through a within-participant study design conducted with 50 participants belonging to two different types of populations (with and without a technological background). Efficiency, effectiveness, understanding, satisfaction, and situation awareness were defined as the dependent variables measured both objectively and subjectively. The proactive mode increased user performance, and understanding of the system and reduced the workload compared to the reactive mode. However, several of the users valued the option of increased user control experienced in the reactive mode. We, therefore, proposed design suggestions to highlight some of the benefits of factoring the reactive mode into the design as a hybrid mode.

AB  - The assessment of mental workload can inform attentional resource allocation during task performance that is essential for understanding the underlying principles of human cognitive-motor behavior. While many studies have focused on mental workload in relation to human performance, a modest body of work has examined it in a motor practice/learning context without considering individual variability. Thus, this work aimed to examine mental workload by employing the NASA TLX as well as the changes in motor performance resulting from the practice of a novel reaching task. Two groups of participants practiced a reaching task at a high and low nominal difficulty during which a group-level analysis assessed the mental workload, motor performance and motor improvement dynamics. A secondary cluster analysis was also conducted to identify specific individual patterns of cognitive-motor responses. Overall, both group- and cluster-level analyses revealed that: (i) all participants improved their performance throughout motor practice, and (ii) an increase in mental workload was associated with a reduction of the quality of motor performance along with a slower rate of motor improvement. The results are discussed in the context of the optimal challenge point framework and in particular it is proposed that under the experimental conditions employed here, functional task difficulty: (i) would possibly depend on an individuals’ information processing capabilities, and (ii) could be indexed by the level of mental workload which, when excessively heightened can decrease the quality of performance and more generally result in delayed motor improvements.

AB  - Interaction by touching a human–machine interaction (HMI) display has gradually evolved into the mainstream mode of human-vehicle interaction. Limiting the level of driver distraction caused by HMIs is an important concern. To explore the different positions and sizes of controls based on the multi-resource demands of the driver, a driving simulator experiment was conducted. The goal was to collect behavioral and subjective workload data from drivers performing secondary tasks under various conditions. Overall, the resources required by the driver to perform secondary tasks were relatively low on the left side of the HMI display and relatively high on the right side. Specifically, the lower-left position of the HMI display required the least resources, whereas the upper-right position required the most. Consequently, the results indicate that the resource demands of the secondary task on the driver decrease as the size of the controls increases. Most drivers preferred a “compromise” control size (18 mm). To reduce the resource demand, the control size of the HMI display should be set to at least 14 mm. This study has high industrial application value, and the results provide guidance for designing in-vehicle HMI displays with improved safety and usability.

AB  - Impulsive sound has been found to annoy people more than steady-state sound or many other types of sound presented at the same sound level. This study examined the physiological, performance, and subjective effects of impulsive sound on working humans. Exposure to impulsive sound (65 dB LAeq) was compared with quiet sound (35 dB LAeq) and steady-state sound (65 dB LAeq). This parallel-group study, where each participant was exposed to one sound condition, had altogether 59 participants. Physiological stress was measured with stress hormone concentrations in plasma (cortisol and noradrenaline), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure. Psychological stress was measured with subjective noise annoyance, workload, and fatigue. Performance was measured in tasks requiring constant concentration (visual and auditory serial recall and N-back). Compared to quiet sound, impulsive sound caused more annoyance, workload, and lack of energy, raised cortisol concentrations, reduced systolic blood pressure, and decreased accuracy in the 3-back task. Compared with steady-state sound, impulsive sound was experienced as more annoying and causing a higher workload and more lack of energy. Impulsive sound caused physiological and psychological stress and decreased performance compared to quiet sound. Part of this load was due to the increased sound level, which was evident as a physiological stress reaction. Still, there was also an extra stress effect related to the impulsiveness of the sound, reflected as a psychological experience. Special care should be paid to impulsive sound, especially in environments where people are performing mental work.

AB  - The ability to identify reliable and sensitive physiological signatures of psychological dimensions is key to developing intelligent adaptive systems that may in turn help to mitigate human error in complex operations. The challenge of this endeavor lies with diagnosticity. Despite different underlying causes, the physiological correlates of workload and acute psychological stress manifest in rather similar ways and can be easily confounded. The current work aimed to build a diagnostic model of mental state through the simultaneous classification of mental workload (varied through three levels of the n-back task) and acute stress (the presence/absence of aversive sounds) with machine learning. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electrocardiography (ECG), the model's classifiers was above-chance to disentangle variations of mental workload from variations of acute stress. Both ECG and fNIRS could predict mental workload level, the best accuracy resulted from the two measures in combination. Stress level could not be accurately diagnosed through ECG alone, only with fNIRS or ECG and fNIRS combined. Individual calibration may be important since stress classification was more accurate for those with higher subjective state anxiety, perhaps due to a greater sensitivity to stress. Mental workload and stress were both better classified with activity in lateral prefrontal regions of the cortex than the medial areas, and the HbO2 signal generally lead to better classification than HHB. The current model represents a step forward to finely discriminate different mental states despite their rather analog physiological correlates.

AB  - Wearable augmented reality (AR) smart glasses have been utilized in various applications such as training, maintenance, and collaboration. However, most previous research on wearable AR technology did not effectively supported situation-aware task assistance because of AR marker-based static visualization and registration. In this study, a smart and user-centric task assistance method is proposed, which combines deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to provide more effective visual guidance with less cognitive load. In particular, instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN and markerless AR are combined to overlay the 3D spatial mapping of an actual object onto its surrounding real environment. In addition, 3D spatial information with instance segmentation is used to provide 3D task guidance and navigation, which helps the user to more easily identify and understand physical objects while moving around in the physical environment. Furthermore, 2.5D or 3D replicas support the 3D annotation and collaboration between different workers without predefined 3D models. Therefore, the user can perform more realistic manufacturing tasks in dynamic environments. To verify the usability and usefulness of the proposed method, we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses by conducting two user studies: 1) matching a virtual object to a real object in a real environment, and 2) performing a realistic task, that is, the maintenance and inspection of a 3D printer. We also implemented several viable applications supporting task assistance using the proposed deep learning-based task assistance in wearable AR.

AB  - The building sector is a significant energy consumer, making building energy optimization crucial for reducing energy demand. Automating energy optimization tasks eases the workload on engineers and hastens energy savings. More than 85% of building data is unstructured and diverse, concealing energy insights that demand laborious extraction. We propose an LLM-based multi-agent framework to explore automated tasks using these data. The framework includes three stages: building information processing, performance diagnosis, and retrofit recommendation, where LLMs injected with domain expertise act as agents for the roles of planner, researcher and advisor. We develop knowledge databases with retriever tools to inject knowledge and validate through experiments. In case studies, our framework delivered reliable results with only $5.15, effectively handling diverse inputs and tasks across cases. This demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce repetitive human labor and costs. We also discuss the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as trustworthy, generalized automated task solvers.

AB  - Subjective workload and situation awareness measures, such as the NASA task load index (TLX) and the situational awareness rating technique (SART), are frequently used in human–system evaluation. However, the interpretation of these ratings is debated. In this study, empirical evidence for the measures' theoretical assumptions was investigated by comparing operators' ratings collected immediately after performing a scenario and ratings collected after operators' acquisition through a video review of the scenario, knowledge of actual system states. Eighteen licensed control room operators participated in the simulator study, running 12 relatively challenging scenarios. It was found that the interpretation of TLX items involving introspection remained stable after operators acquired factual scenario knowledge, while the interpretation of items involving the perception of external events, such as situation awareness and performance, depended on the operators' scenario knowledge. The result shows that operators’ ratings could discriminate between mental effort, performance, frustration, and situation awareness. No clear evidence for the SART index as a measure of situation awareness was found. Instead, a subjective situation awareness measure developed for this study was distinct from workload and related to operator performance, showing that this type of measure warrants future investigation of its validity. The study findings help in developing measurement procedures and interpreting subjective measures. Finally, the study reveals that informing operators about the scenario can provide useful subjective ratings of situation awareness and performance. Future research should include procedures for how to inform participants adequately and efficiently in subjective assessments.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that manufacturing energy and environmental costs are a growing factor in the overall energy footprint of computing systems. The quantification of these impacts requires the evaluation of both the manufacturing and use phase energy/environmental costs of major integrated circuit (IC) components, including processing units, memory, and storage. In particular, expansions of memory and cache can potentially increase manufacturing costs beyond what can be recovered through use phase advantages for reasonable usage patterns. With this holistic view of sustainability in mind, we provide evaluations of the environmental impacts of memory and cache options for Parsec and SPEC multi-program workloads. Using indifference point analysis, we determine which architectural decisions are the most sustainable in the context of these workloads for various usage scenarios. Through a form of break even analysis, we show the impact of upgrading to a new technology node. Our analysis of current processor trends indicates that upgrading may require upwards of 10 years of service time to break even, and that designing systems with smaller cache and main memory sizes may provide an overall positive environmental trend without dramatically reducing performance.

AB  - One of the key elements needed to test most large-scale scheduling algorithms is a testing infrastructure. Large scale is of upmost importance as failures and complex behaviors are common occurrences only at such scale. In order to test the reaction of a system to failures or extreme behaviors, it is necessary to be able to create large scale environments. Such an infrastructure must be reproducible so that several studies are able to compare themselves but also capable of diversity as otherwise it would risk to limit them to particular subcases. In this article, we propose a generic adaptable and reusable model of large scale workload. The original schema comes from the Google Cluster Workload Traces which is a perfect representative of large scale production workload. The methodology to produce the model can be used at different precision levels and can classify the input level without human supervision. Contrary to most model analysis of such traces, we propose along with our model a reference implementation in order for other studies using our results to produce comparable experiments.

AB  - Healthcare workers must balance competing priorities to deliver high-quality patient care. Rasmussen's Dynamic Safety Model proposed three factors that organisations must balance to maintain acceptable performance, but there has been little empirical exploration of these ideas, and little is known about the risk trade-offs workers make in practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the different pressures that healthcare workers experience, what risk trade-off decisions they make in response to pressures, and to analyse the implications for quality and safety. The study involved 88.5 h of ethnographic observations at a large, teaching hospital in central London. The analysis revealed five distinct categories of hospital pressures faced by healthcare workers: efficiency, organisational, workload, personal, and quality and safety pressures. Workers most often traded-off workload, personal, and quality and safety pressures to accommodate system-level priorities. The Pressures Diagram was developed to visualise risk trade-offs and prioritising decisions and to facilitate communication about these aspects of healthcare work.

AB  - The single-batch machine, commonly found in industrial manufacturing, can concurrently process a group of jobs in variable-speed batches, leading to fluctuating levels of both energy consumption and processing time. Identifying an optimal balance between total energy consumption and makespan presents a challenge due to the intricate nature of their relationship in real-world scenarios. This study introduces a mixed-integer programming model designed to determine optimal machine operating states for diverse workloads, meeting customer requirements while concurrently achieving energy savings for sustainability. An energy-aware batch scheduling deep Q-learning network (EBSDQN) framework has been created, encompassing sequencing policies, batching rules, and speed adjustment policies. This framework is explicitly crafted to tackle the NP-hard problem, a challenge that commonly perplexes commercial solvers like Gurobi when seeking optimal solutions within a 360-second time frame for small-scale instances. The EBSDQN design is fortified with efficient action decoding policies, refined reward assessments, exploitative neighborhood rules, and a streamlined buffer training process. This approach not only conserves training time but also adapts dynamically in accordance with the principles of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and deep neural network. The developed algorithm exhibits impressive robustness, reaching convergence after 600 episodes of training. In separate comparisons with a commercial solver, two single-objective algorithms, and two multi-objective algorithms, our algorithm consistently demonstrates superior overall performance across the same instances. In the worst-case analysis, further examination delves into the influences of job features. In summary, this study underscores the high sensitivity of both TEC and Cmax to job processing time distribution, suggesting the prioritization of TEC over Cmax in optimization for sustainable planning and operations. Furthermore, this research has the potential to accelerate the integration of artificial intelligence into the manufacturing sector.

AB  - Air traffc controller workload is an important impediment to air transport growth. Several approaches exist that aim to better understand the causes for workload, and models have been derived to predict workload in new operational settings. These methods often relate workload to the diffculty, or complexity, that an average controller would have to safely manage all traffc in a sector with a particular traffc demand. In this paper, several of these complexity-based metrics for workload will be compared. Of special interest is whether the complexity measures transfer from one sector design to another. That is, does a metric that is well-tuned to predict workload for controllers working in one sector, also predict the workload for another group of controllers active in a different sector? Results from a human-in-the-loop experiment show that a solution space-based metric, which requires no tuning or weighing at all, has the highest correlations with subjectively reported workload, and also yields the best workload predictions across different controller groups and sectors.

AB  - Multi-manned workstations, where a worker team synchronously executes different operations on the same product, have the potential to increase disassembly line performance. Despite focusing on main objectives such as workload imbalance and worker performance, existing disassembly line balancing studies have not addressed worker satisfaction. This study addresses the disassembly line worker assignment and balancing problem by considering not only multi-manned workstations with heterogeneous workers, but also workers' preference and performance. A novel multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is formulated with the following objectives: minimizing the number of workers, the number of workstations, workload imbalance, maximizing worker satisfaction, and worker performance. Moreover, this study is proposing heuristics to utilize game theory-oriented approaches in the context of the addressed problem. Some comparative studies were carried out to compare the performance of the proposed heuristics. The effects of the factors were revealed by the statistical analysis conducted on the solutions for newly generated test problems. After the superiority of the proposed heuristics was indicated through comparative studies, they were applied to a washing machine disassembly system in the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) industry. The application indicated the performance improvement for the disassembly lead time (65%) and the space requirement (64%) compared to a classical disassembly system design.

AB  - With increasing environmental awareness and energy requirement, sustainable manufacturing has attracted growing attention. Meanwhile, there is a high level of uncertainty in practical processing procedure, particularly in flexible manufacturing systems. This study addresses the multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem with fuzzy processing time (MOFFJSP) to minimize the makespan and the total workload simultaneously. A mixed integer liner programming model is presented and a hybrid self-adaptive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (HPEA) is proposed to handle this problem. HPEA has the following features: (i) two problem-specific initial rules considering triangular fuzzy number are presented for hybrid initialization to generate diverse solutions; (ii) five problem-specific local search methods are incorporated to enhance the exploitation; (iii) an effective solution selection method based on Tchebycheff decomposition strategy is utilized to balance the convergence and diversity; and (iv) a parameter selection strategy is proposed to improve the quality of non-dominated solutions. To verify the effectiveness of HPEA, it is compared against other well-known multi-objective optimization algorithms. The results demonstrate that HPEA outperforms these five state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms in solving MOFFJSP.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to validate an analytical method in assessing demanded mental workloads for physical therapists, and to discuss its possible ergonomics implications on the design of healthcare working systems in which physical therapists are considered as the users. A task analysis was first used to understand the operation steps of three identified physical therapies. Then, the McCracken–Aldrich technique was applied to assign ratings of mental workload demanded for performing each step of the therapies. Finally, the assigned ratings were validated by the analysis of correlation with the answers of the NASA-TLX questionnaire collected from seventeen physical therapists in the rehabilitation center of a university-affiliated hospital. Results showed that the proposed McCracken–Aldrich technique was suitable as an analysis tool for predicting metal workloads of physical therapists. Some possible implications about the information provision and user interface design for reducing therapists' mental workloads on current therapy operations were discussed.

AB  - This paper proposes a decision support tool for maintenance capacity planning of complex product systems. The tool – ForeSim-BI – addresses the problem faced by maintenance organizations in forecasting the workload of future maintenance interventions and in planning an adequate capacity to face that expected workload. Developed and implemented from a predictive analytics perspective in the particular context of a Portuguese aircraft maintenance organization, the tool integrates four main modules: (1) a forecasting module used to predict future and unprecedented maintenance workloads from historical data; (2) a Bayesian inference module used to transform prior workload forecasts, resulting from the forecasting module, into predictive forecasts after observations on the maintenance interventions being predicted become available; (3) a simulation module used to characterize the forecasted total workloads through sets of random variables, including maintenance work types, maintenance work phases, and maintenance work skills; and (4) a Bayesian network module used to combine the simulated workloads with historical data through probabilistic inference. A linear programming model is also developed to improve the efficiency of the decision-making process supported by Bayesian networks. The tool uses real industrial data, comprising 171 aircraft maintenance projects collected at the host organization, and is validated by comparing its results with real observations of a given maintenance intervention to which predictions were made and with a model simulating current forecasting practices employed in industry. Significantly more accurate forecasts have been obtained with the proposed tool, resulting in an important cost saving potential for maintenance organizations.

AB  - Like all human actors, politicians possess limited cognitive capacity. In ordinary interactions, this limitation discourages political decision-makers from addressing high-dimensional policy problems unless incentivized to do so by exogenous “focusing events.” Public policy researchers have documented this pattern extensively, and have argued that cognitive constraints help explain the “stick–slip” dynamics that characterize macro-level policymaking. However, data and measurement limitations have prevented these studies from examining individual-level information processing patterns. In this paper, I develop a text-based approach designed to measure diversity of attention at an individual level, which I apply to an original dataset of Congressional hearing transcripts surrounding the 2008–2009 Financial Crisis. I find that individual speakers engaged with a more diverse set of topics during the crisis than before its onset, and became more focused as the crisis subsided.
