AB  - Card-based systems – like Kanban and Constant Work-in-Process (ConWIP) – can be simple yet effective means of controlling production. Existing systems, however, can be criticized for their limited applicability and scope. First, card-based systems have not been successful in the production environments that are arguably most in need of their help: complex job shops that produce low-volume, high-variety products. Second, while most existing systems simplify shop floor control, other planning tasks – such as the estimation of short, feasible due dates during customer enquiry management – are not supported. To overcome these limitations, a card-based version of Workload Control – known as COBACABANA (COntrol of BAlance by CArd-BAsed Navigation) – was recently proposed that uses cards for both due date estimation and order release control. This unique combination makes COBACABANA a potentially important means of controlling production, particularly for small job shops with limited resources. However, the original approach had several shortcomings. This paper refines the due date estimation procedure of COBACABANA to make it more practical and consistent with the order release method applied. It then uses simulation to demonstrate – for the first time – the potential of COBACABANA as an integrated concept that combines customer enquiry management and order release control to improve job shop performance. Results also suggest that the need for processing time estimations can be simplified, further facilitating the implementation of COBACABANA in practice.

AB  - Home health care (HHC) companies serve as the alternative to hospitals aiming to provide customers with medical care at home. A crucial challenge for HHC providers is to optimize routes and schedules for their caregivers to serve customers. Inspired by the practices in the HHC industry, this paper addresses a multi-objective home healthcare routing and scheduling problem (HHRSP) with several conflicting objectives: minimizing routing cost and improving service consistency and workload balance. We refer to the problem as a multi-objective consistent home healthcare routing and scheduling problem (MoConHHRSP). To be more practical, uncertain travel and service times are also considered and defined based on uncertainty theory. Next, the uncertain programming model for the proposed MoConHHRSP is formulated and then reduced to its deterministic equivalent. Due to the NP-hard essence of the problem, an improved multi-objective artificial bee colony (IMOABC) metaheuristic, integrating the large neighborhood search heuristic and an adapted non-dominated solution set update strategy into the multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) framework, is developed. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the competitive performance of the designed algorithm by comparing it with other multi-objective algorithms from multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the trade-off analysis reveals that a better caregiver consistency can be achieved at a high price of total costs and workload balance, while a great improvement on the workload balance can be provided with little deterioration in caregiver consistency. In many cases, low total costs and a high level of workload balance can be achieved simultaneously.

AB  - In this paper, we address a scheduling problem in a real manufacturing job shop characterized by dynamic routing constraints and resource unavailability. Different assignment heuristics are developed to investigate the hypothesis that additional system details in the solving algorithm can improve the algorithm’s performance. The heuristics are compared in terms of output performance as both stand-alone scheduling solutions and initialization algorithms for metaheuristic optimization. A multi-objective function is used to minimize makespan, resource’s idle time, and job’s lateness. Alternative encoding schemes and deadlock prevention mechanisms are also investigated. The results show that the initial heuristic purely based on the earliest finish concept performs as well as more information intensive heuristics; another heuristic based on the localization approach also shows good performance. The main finding in this work is that looking ahead of a resource workload is a very efficient and effective logic to both prevent deadlocks and reduce idle times, especially when implemented in conjunction with metaheuristic optimization.

AB  - Abstract:
In the framework of future innovation and for the sake of road safety, there is a great hope in fully supporting, or even replacing, the human driver by reliable technology. But, due to the novelty of this context, an important care will have to be devoted to investigate drivers' expectation, needs, behavior and functional abilities to reach this goal. In this context, this paper reviews several human factors issues related to partial and fully automated vehicles, with discussion of strengths and weaknesses of methods investigating driver automation acceptability, trust, situation awareness and workload. Main results of these parameters in relation to automated driving are presented and relevant methodologies to investigate these human variables are discussed in the perspective of real road experiments context.

AB  - The electric power system is based on a large-scale non-linear system that creates various stability issues. One of the issues is the Transient Stability Assessment, due to multiple hindrances, the power system aims to maintain its synchronism. In the power system, ensuring reliability in planning, control, and monitoring is essential. With the development of new techniques like electric components, power electronics, renewable power generations, etc., to ensure safety and reliability, and improve economic conditions, human interference is complicated. Therefore, a computer-based assessment is needed. Transient stability assessment (TSA) ensures security and provides stable operation in the power system. This paper proposed support-vector machines(SVM)-based support-vector machines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to assist the operation of the power system (SVM-CNN). The novelty of the proposed work is, it minimizes the workload of operational staff and improves efficiency and ability using SVM-based CNN. With the proposed accuracy rate for the training data set was 97.02 %, and the testing data set was 96.83 %. SVM got 96.44 %, and CNN got 96.68 % in the training data set. and the testing data set produces 95.24 % in SVM and 95.74 % in the CNN model.

AB  - The technical protection provided by information security technology is necessary as a frontline defense against threats. However, the human element adds great risk to systems and cannot be ignored. This research explores the human elements related to security communications and intention to comply with security directives. Security communications are more-commonly being sent using richer computer-based channels. While the goal of security communications is the gain compliance, there is still much to learn related to what influences a user to comply. This research explores the effects that (im)politeness has on intention to comply with security directives. The research utilized an experiment that focused on secure browser setting directives using several types of online communication. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive communications/directives that were text-based, text/image-based, or video-based. The communications were also grouped into polite and impolite messaging. The results for the overall model indicated perceived richness had a negative influence on perceived mental workload. Additionally, perceived mental workload resulted in a decreased intention to comply with security directives. There were no significant differences between polite and impolite groups for the treatment groups with text-based and text/image-based messaging. However, in the video-based treatment, the relationship between perceived richness and intention to comply with security directives was significantly different between the polite and impolite groups.

Ten students participated in this study. The participants utilized a touch screen at different installation heights (50, 65, and 80% of stature), tilt angles (0°, 45°, and 90° from the horizontal plane), and having different button sizes (a square with a side of 10, 20, and 30 mm). The joint angles, when using a touch screen, were measured to calculate the joint torque ratios (JTRs). Subjective screen visibility were also determined. The optimal installation position was determined by solving a bi-objective optimization problem consisting of two objective functions. The Pareto optimal solutions for the two objectives showed a range of 1124–1251 mm and 44.4–67.9°. The proposed method determined the optimal installation position of the touch screens.

AB  - Predicting separation errors in the daily tasks of air traffic controllers (ATCOs) is essential for the timely implementation of mitigation strategies before performance declines and the prevention of loss of separation and aircraft collisions. However, three challenges impede accurate separation errors forecasting: 1) compounding relationships between many human factors and control processes require sufficient operation process data to capture how separation errors occur and propagate within controller-in-the-loop processes; 2) previous human factor measurement approaches are disruptive to controllers’ daily operations because they use invasive sensors, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), 3) errors accumulated in using the tasks and human behaviors for estimating system dynamics challenge accurate separation error predictions with sufficient leading time for proactive control actions. This study proposed a separation error prediction framework with a long leading time (>50 s) to address the above challenges, including 1) a multi-factorial model that characterizes the inter-relationships between task complexity, behavioral activity, cognitive load, and operational performance; 2) a multimodal data analytics approach to non-intrusively extract the task features (i.e., traffic density) from high-fidelity simulation systems and visual behavioral features (i.e., head pose, eyelid movements, and facial expressions) from ATCOs’ facial videos; 3) an encoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict long-time-ahead separation errors by integrating multimodal features for reducing accumulated errors. A user study with six experienced ATCOs tested the proposed framework using the Phoenix Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) simulator. The authors evaluated the model performance through two types of metrics: 1) point-level metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, and 2) sequence-level metrics, including alignment accuracy and sequence similarity. The results showed that 1) the model using the task and visual behavioral features significantly improved the prediction performance compared to the model using one single feature (eyelid movements), with an improvement of up to 26.95% in alignment accuracy for 10s-ahead prediction; 2) the model that combined task and visual behavioral features had a higher or comparable performance to models with different hybrid features, achieving an alignment accuracy of 82.38% for 50s-ahead error prediction; and (3) the proposed method outperformed three baseline models – Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and classic LSTM – by 8.21%, 3.47%, and 3.14% in alignment accuracy, respectively, for predicting 50s-ahead separation errors. These results suggest that the proposed model can effectively predict separation errors in air traffic control.

AB  - Monitoring the degradation of machines to anticipate potential failures represents a significant challenge. In Industry 4.0, this task is critical when the costs associated with maintenance and stoppages on the productive processes are high. Nowadays, many preventive maintenance techniques employ supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms. However, the definition of which features should be processed by such algorithms is not a simple task, being crucial to the proposed technique’s success. Against this background, we consider whether unsupervised algorithms combined with time-series decomposition can enhance the estimate of a machine’s health. This article proposes HealthMon as a novel approach to compute a health index of machines based on sensor measurements. HealthMon extracts time-series from such sensors, which are decomposed in an unsupervised way to present the health state along time. The health index is related to the degradation of the considered machine, thus optimizing the machine maintenance schedule. This work advances the state-of-the-art in the following ways: (i) it proposes a novel index of machines health, which yields a more direct and intuitive view of machine degradation; (ii) it devises the first approach capable of estimating the health index of a machine in a completely unsupervised way; (iii) it generalizes vibrating and rotating machines, thus being able to monitor a wide range of industrial equipment. We evaluated our method using both simulated and real data. The results show that the evolution of vibrating machines’ failures can be effectively detected under various input workloads. Finally, through HealthMon, industry decision-makers benefit from the guidelines for preventive actions at appropriate times, thus meeting Industry 4.0.

AB  - POLCA (Paired-cell Overlapping Loops of Cards with Authorization) is a production control system specifically designed for low-volume, high-mix and custom-engineered products. It is a visual control system that manages the flow of jobs though the shop floor by making use of overlapping loops of cards between pairs of successive manufacturing cells. These overlapping loops of cards realize a decentralized decision-making structure for job release. This means that jobs do not await release in a centralized pre-shop pool. Rather jobs are immediately forwarded to a gateway manufacturing cells at their shop arrival, where they wait in release lists for available POLCA cards. However, the Workload Control literature has shown that using a centralized pre-shop pool provides important benefits. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of centralized job release on POLCA performance. Using simulation, we demonstrate that centralized job release outperforms decentralised release if the right card acquisition rule for job release is used. This has important implications for both research and practice calling for more research on POLCA systems.

AB  - Background
In Sub-Saharan Africa, unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) is a growing threat to achieving ‘the last mile’ towards ending AIDS by 2030. Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is a multisession transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy protocol that can treat a range of common co-morbid mental and behavioral mental health problems, including UAU. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we previously reported that CETA was clinically effective in reducing UAU and mental health comorbidities among PWH in Zambia. In this qualitative evaluation we sought to explore health worker, key policymaker and patient perspectives on the acceptability and feasibility of integrating CETA within existing HIV services.
Methodology
We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with PWH who reported alcohol use, lay and profession HIV clinic staff, and key informant interviews with policy-makers. Following trial completion, we conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) among people with HIV and UAU who received CETA, and HIV peer counsellors that provided CETA. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed in NVivo 12 using thematic analysis. Emerging themes were organized according to acceptability and feasibility.
Results
All participant types reported CETA to be acceptable due to the perceived need and relevance to HIV-related behavioral health issues. HIV peer counselors, successfully provided CETA with a rigorous supervision structure using an apprenticeship model. Participants receiving CETA also remained motivated throughout the sessions as they learned new problem-solving skills, which they continued to use following the close of the study. Implementation factors related to limited behavioral health infrastructure, workloads, and human resources were seen as challenges to the scale-up and sustainability of CETA within HIV care.
Conclusion
CETA was feasible and acceptable at 2 urban sites in Zambia. Future studies integrating of CETA into HIV care should consider implementation factors such as infrastructure, workloads, and human resources to support integration into HIV care.

AB  - Assessments constitute a fundamental and inevitable component of any educational journey. Manual effort required for the evaluation of these assessments is very high. Automation of the evaluation process and grading helps in making the review process more efficient, objective, and scalable, thereby reducing the workload of human reviewers. Automating the grading process for multiple-choice and short-answer assessments is relatively straightforward, but it poses significant challenges when applied to the evaluation of formal languages, particularly in the context of mathematical assessments. In this paper a model that automatically evaluates and grades the Quadratic Equation problems is presented. The study is conducted using a manually curated dataset comprising 1200 solutions to various quadratic equation problems. Embeddings of the quadratic solutions are generated using Google’s T5 Model. These embeddings are then used to train different traditional and ensembled machine learning models along with complex Deep learning models like LSTM and Bi LSTM. An in-depth analysis of the fine-tuned T5 model’s performance, evaluating its effectiveness in comparison with the pretrained T5 model in automatic grading of quadratic equation problems has been explored. Fine-tuning significantly contributes to the reduction of error by 70% and a noticeable increase in the R2 value to 97%.

AB  - Infrastructure systems are large-scale complex socio-technical systems that rely on humans for their safety critical decision-making activities. In the case of railroad networks, hierarchical organizations denoted as traffic control centers (TCCs) operate 24/7 in order to maintain successful network operations. Interacting social and technical factors influence TCC operational environments and thus the overall performance of the railroad system. This research presents a novel data envelopment analysis (DEA) application along with its implementation and validation by investigating the workload boundary of human performance through a case study built for the Belgian railway (INFRABEL) TCCs. We pursue two research foci. The first is to identify organizational, socio-economic, and technical factors that describe the performance environments in which TCC personnel operate. We use these factors to determine relatively homogeneous performance environments using multivariate statistical methods. The second focus is to design and implement on-site a socio-technical performance measurement framework, based on a new and unique dataset at the workstation level that is capable of considering socio-technical heterogeneity. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we apply a two-stage clustering approach to generate statistically relatively homogeneous groups. Second, we calculate meta - and in-cluster efficiency scores. Finally, we assess the validity of our results with INFRABEL. Results reveal three insights: (i) efficiency improvement strategies require further investigation based on temporal trends; (ii) disregarding performance environment heterogeneity leads to over estimation in target setting; and (iii) socio-technical system design could be informed by applying DEA, provided that, domain specific expertise is used in the model formulation.

AB  - Detecting transient changes in heart rate and heart rate variability during experimental simulated autonomous driving scenarios can indicate participant arousal and cognitive load, providing valuable insights into the relationship between human and vehicle autonomy. Successfully detecting such parameters unobtrusively may assist these experimental situations as well as naturalistic driver monitoring systems within an autonomous vehicle. However, non-contact sensors must collect reliable and accurate signals. This study aims to compare the in-seat, non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor to the gold standard, contact Biopac sensor. Thirty participants took part in five-minute simulated autonomous vehicle journeys in a city environment and a rural environment, and a five-minute resting condition. To ensure the seat sensor was sensitive to elevated heart rate values, heart rate was also collected following the energetic Harvard Step Test. Lin concordance coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses were employed to assess the level of agreement between the non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor and the contact Biopac sensor for heart rate and heart rate variability. Analyses revealed a high level of agreement (rc > 0.96) between both sensors for one-minute averaged heart rate and five-minute averaged heart rate variability during simulated autonomous driving and rest, and one-minute averaged heart rate following the Harvard Step Test. In addition, the non-contact sensor was sensitive to significant differences during tasks. This proof of principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using the non-contact Plessey EPIC sensor to accurately detect heart rate and heart rate variability during simulated autonomous driving environments.

AB  - Criminal activities have been posing threat to human societies. In many countries, police officers have been serving as one major solution in addressing crime. However, some countries suffer from a scarcity of police officers and the unbalanced distribution of police forces. In this research, we study the law enforcement problem to address the aforementioned situation by dividing it into two sub-problems, i.e., the police staffing problem and the workload assignment problem. To improve staffing efficiency and service quality, we propose a double-resource queueing model (DRQM) with referral and a single-resource queueing model (SRQM) with inner classification. We solve the problems of police staffing and workload assignment by optimizing the referral threshold in the DRQM and the inner classification criterion in the SRQM. Results show that the SRQM with inner classification can always achieve higher staffing efficiency than the DRQM with referral. On service quality, dependent on the optimal referral threshold in DRQM or the optimal inner classification criterion in SRQM, either DRQM or SRQM is preferred.

AB  - In the exploration of human–machine collaborative scoring of subjective assignment (HMCSSA) problems, it is crucial to note that the workloads assigned to humans and machines are determined by thresholds at various levels of granularity within the human–machine task allocation model. To address this issue, a three-phase framework for optimization and decision making in HMCSSA problems is constructed by combining multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with multi-attribute decision making method. Specifically, we present a bi-objective threshold optimization model to achieve a trade-off between human costs and scoring fairness in HMCSSA problems. Moreover, four well-known MOEAs are employed for solving the optimization model to search the Pareto optimal thresholds. Meanwhile, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is utilized to determine the best human–machine task allocation schemes based on the preferences of decision makers. The numerical experiments are conducted on eight prompts of the ASAP data set to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework. In particular, the best task allocation scheme attains the fairness gain of 53.76% with the human participation rate of 21.77% on average.

AB  - To ensure the safety of operations in safety-critical systems, it is necessary to maintain operators׳ situation awareness (SA) at a high level. A situation awareness support system (SASS) has therefore been developed to handle uncertain situations [1]. This paper aims to systematically evaluate the enhancement of SA in SASS by applying a multi-perspective approach. The approach consists of two SA metrics, SAGAT and SART, and one workload metric, NASA-TLX. The first two metrics are used for the direct objective and subjective measurement of SA, while the third is used to estimate operator workload. The approach is applied in a safety-critical environment called residue treater, located at a chemical plant in which a poor human-system interface reduced the operator׳s SA and caused one of the worst accidents in US history. A counterbalanced within-subjects experiment is performed using a virtual environment interface with and without the support of SASS. The results indicate that SASS improves operators׳ SA, and specifically has benefits for SA levels 2 and 3. In addition, it is concluded that SASS reduces operator workload, although further investigations in different environments with a larger number of participants have been suggested.

AB  - Picking of components from large containers is common both within trade and industry, but is often associated with poor working conditions in terms of ergonomics, as well as with low time efficiency. Providing quantitative evidence from an actual industrial setting, the paper shows how both the picking time and the physical workload varies depending on the position of each component within the container picked from. It is clear that there are considerable differences between the front and the rear sections of the pallet, as well as between the top and the bottom sections. Moreover, the paper shows that picking from a large container that is tilted is significantly better from a perspective of time efficiency. In contrast, the difference in terms of physical workload between picking from a horizontal and a tilted pallet is relatively small for most pallet sections.

AB  - There are multiple topic areas relevant to human sustainability in organizational behavior. These have recently been integrated into Restricted Employee Sustainability Theory (REST). However, REST as currently formulated focuses on individual employees, leaving the theory undersocialized and undercontextualized. Moreover, REST leaves responsibility for human sustainability on individual employees. We extend rest to take a leader-focused perspective. We highlight how leaders can monitor employees who may be in different employee sustainability states, and how these different employees have different needs which should be managed differently. We discuss how leaders can build a culture which values human sustainability. We delineate three different tensions faced by leaders in the context of human sustainability (short term productivity versus long term human sustainability, protecting human capital versus avoiding paternalism, and maintaining lean payrolls versus maintaining a robust capacity for workload spikes). Finally, we close with a discussion of practical implications and future research. In doing so, we discuss how leaders can enhance the human sustainability of their subordinates and their organizations.

AB  - Why are human inferences sometimes remarkably close to the Bayesian ideal and other times systematically biased? In particular, why do humans make near-rational inferences in some natural domains where the candidate hypotheses are explicitly available, whereas tasks in similar domains requiring the self-generation of hypotheses produce systematic deviations from rational inference. We propose that these deviations arise from algorithmic processes approximating Bayes’ rule. Specifically in our account, hypotheses are generated stochastically from a sampling process, such that the sampled hypotheses form a Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior. While this approximation will converge to the true posterior in the limit of infinite samples, we take a small number of samples as we expect that the number of samples humans take is limited. We show that this model recreates several well-documented experimental findings such as anchoring and adjustment, subadditivity, superadditivity, the crowd within as well as the self-generation effect, the weak evidence, and the dud alternative effects. We confirm the model’s prediction that superadditivity and subadditivity can be induced within the same paradigm by manipulating the unpacking and typicality of hypotheses. We also partially confirm our model’s prediction about the effect of time pressure and cognitive load on these effects.

AB  - Overhang structures can be found in engineering components fabricated by powder bed electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) technology. The support structures are needed for an overhang, or severe overhang distortion may be caused by repeated rapid heating and cooling cycles in the layer-by-layer manufacturing process. Current overhang support generation methods usually utilize certain types of structures to fill the overhang space. They may overestimate the amount of support, thus, the post process time can be potentially increased. The objective of this study is to investigate an effective support design method to reduce support material usage and post process workload in EBAM process. In this research, a combined heat support and support anchor design method has been proposed. The stress and deformation of overhang configuration has been evaluated by a thermomechanical model. The design procedure has been introduced in details for a typical overhang example. The simulations have demonstrated that overhang warping can be effectively reduced by the application of a heat support beneath overhang region and support anchors which connect overhang and heat support.

AB  - This paper considers a load-sharing man-machine system with multiple man-machine units (MMUs) subject to machine degradation, human errors, and random shocks. Human errors affect the machine that the person operates in a MMU and contribute to dependent competing failure processes (DCFPs) of unit (DCFPsU): soft and hard failure processes. Random shocks affect all MMUs and contribute to DCFPs of system (DCFPsS): unit soft/hard failure one after another until the system failure and common cause failures. In addition, once a MMU fails, more workloads are shared on surviving MMUs due to load-sharing characteristic, which increase not only machine degradation rates but also human error intensities. We incorporate human errors into reliability analysis besides degradation processes and random shocks and develop an analytical reliability model of load-sharing man-machine system. A Poisson-type human error model considering the effects of workload is proposed first. To model the DCFPsU, DCFPsS, and load-sharing characteristic, conditional distributions of DCFPsU and conditional probability density functions of MMU failures are investigated. A system reliability model is then developed based on total probability formula through analytical derivation. Finally, a load-sharing 2-out-of-3:G lathe system and small-, medium- and large-scale examples are implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the reliability model.

AB  - Increasingly heavy workloads require components of construction machinery to have higher wear resistance, while the application of high-grade low-alloy wear-resistant steel in the machinery manufacturing industry is restricted greatly by its high hardness. Thus, it is of great significance to improve the wear resistance of low-alloy abrasion-resistant steels without increasing their hardness. A series of TiC-reinforced low-alloy abrasion-resistant steels with different hardness was developed by a conventional smelting-casting method. The microstructure of the TiC-reinforced steels was martensite, and micro- and nano-sized TiC particles were distributed in the martensite matrix. The three-body abrasive wear behaviors of a series of TiC-reinforced steels and conventional steels under dry and wet sand conditions were studied using dry and wet sand/rubber wheel testing machines, respectively. Under dry sand conditions, the main wear mechanism of TiC-reinforced steels was plastic deformation and fatigue spalling, and the wear resistance of the TiC-reinforced steels was more than 1.5 times that of conventional steels with the same hardness. Under wet sand conditions, the wear mechanism of TiC-reinforced steels was slight micro-cutting and peeling, the relative wear resistance of the TiC-reinforced steels was more than 1.4 times that of conventional steels.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of shiphandling manoeuvres on mental workload and physiological reactions in ten marine pilots. Each pilot performed four berthings in a ship simulator. Those berthings were differentiated by two factors, level of difficulty and familiarity with the port. Each berthing could also be divided into five phases, three during the execution and two resting periods, one before and one after the execution (dedicated to baseline physiological data collection). Mental workload was measured through two self assessment scales: the NASA TLX and a Likert scale. Power spectral densities on Beta bands 1 and 2 were obtained from EEG. Heart rate and heart rate variability were obtained from ECG. Pupil dilation was obtained from eye tracking. Workload levels were higher as berthings increased in difficulty level and/or the pilots completed the berthings in unfamiliar ports. Responses differed across specific phases of the berthings. Physiological responses could indirectly monitor levels of mental workload, and could be adopted in future applications to evaluate training improvements and performance. This study provides an example of an applied methodology aiming to define an upper redline of task demands in the context of marine pilotage.

AB  - Constant high temperature conditions in tunnel not only significantly reduced the labor efficiency of workers but also affected their physical and mental health. However, the traditional design of ventilation and cooling for high geothermal tunnel construction only considers the control of environment temperature and ignores the thermal comfort state of the workers, which will increase the potential risk of tunnel safety accidents. Therefore, this paper adopted the methods of scene testing, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation to establish a modified evaluation model applicable to the thermal comfort of workers in high geothermal tunnels. By analyzing the temperature distribution pattern of heat-sensitive parts of workers engaged in different labor intensity under different air supply parameters, the design strategy for ventilation and cooling of high-temperature tunnels was refined on the basis of ensuring that the environment temperature and thermal comfort meet the requirements. The results show that ventilation design parameters that satisfy the environmental temperature control criteria are equally adequate for worker thermal comfort at light-intensity work. However, when the ambient temperature is higher than 40 °C, the thermal comfort of workers engaged in medium-intensity work still does not meet the requirements, even if the ambient temperature already meets the criteria. It is recommended that the wind speed be increased by at least 8.3 %, 15.6%and 28.6 % for ambient temperatures of 40 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C, respectively. More effective cooling techniques should be tried to further enhance thermal comfort for workers engaged in heavy workloads especially in hot environments exceeding 40 °C.

This semi-autonomous robotic task is categorized into so-called overlapping interaction, where a human and an automatic controller determine the same signal and how to blend them is appropriately determined so that ideal operation supports for the operator are achieved. To this end, we build a human model from the operation data of an expert through Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and design an autonomy determination mechanism based on the variance information given by GPR. Moreover, in order to allow the human interventions in dealing with various uncertainties in the real operation, we further add logic to switch automatic and manual control to the autonomy determination mechanism based on the variance of the operator's GPR model. Various user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the present support system in terms of control performances and human workload.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems typically consist of a combination of mobile devices, embedded systems and computers to monitor, sense, and actuate with the surrounding real world. These computing elements are usually wireless, interconnected to share data and interact with each other, with the server part and also with cloud computing services. In such a heterogeneous environment, new applications arise to meet ever-increasing needs and these are an important challenge to the processing capabilities of devices. For example, automatic driving systems, manufacturing environments, smart city management, etc. To meet the requirements of said application contexts, the system can create computing processes to distribute the workload over the network and/or a cloud computing server. Multiple options arise in relation to what network nodes should support the execution of the processes. This paper focuses on this problem by introducing a distributed computational model to dynamically share these tasks among the computing nodes and considering the inherent variability of the context in these environments. Our novel approach promotes the integration of the computing resources, with externally supplied cloud services, to fulfill modern application requirements. A prototype implementation for the proposed model has been built and an application example has been designed to validate the proposal in a real working environment.

AB  - Periodic crack detection is of great significance in preventing bridge failures and saving maintenance costs. In the past few decades, crack detection was highly depended on human-conducted on-site inspections. It was not transformed to automatic crack defection until a spot light on deep learning. Although automatic detection based on deep learning is of advantage in both of efficiency and accuracy, the heavy workload of manual annotation is the first challenge we face. Collecting rich and well-balanced crack defect datasets is the second one. To rise to the challenges, this paper proposes two improved CycleGANs, named Tiny Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network (Tiny-CycleGAN) and Multi Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network (Multi-CycleGAN). Additionally, inside of the neural networks we propose, we introduce spectral normalization into the discriminators of them to boost synthesis quality and stabilize training. Experimental results demonstrate that these approaches not only translate from bridge crack images to their paired high-quality label images, but also augment crack images from unpaired label images effectively. Lastly, a deep learning based semantic segmentation network, U-Net with attention gate (AttU-Net), is trained on the augmented dataset to evaluate the performance of improved CycleGANs. The evaluations of semantic segmentation show that dataset of augmentation with Multi-CycleGAN outperforms dataset without augmentation by up to 0.5417 on mIoU and 97.45% on mPA, respectively.

AB  - Evaluating operator mental workload (MW) in human-machine systems via neurophysiological signals is crucial for preventing unpredicted operator performance degradation. However, the feature of physiological signals is associated with the historical values at the previous time steps and its statistical properties vary across individuals and types of mental tasks. In this study, we propose a new transfer dynamical autoencoder (TDAE) to capture the dynamical properties of electroencephalograph (EEG) features and the individual differences. The TDAE consists of three consecutively-connected modules, which are termed as feature filter, abstraction filter, and transferred MW classifier. The feature and abstraction filters introduce dynamical deep network to abstract the EEG features across adjacent time steps to salient MW indicators. Transferred MW classifier exploits large volume EEG data from an source-domain EEG database recorded under emotional stimuli to improve the model training stability. We tested our algorithms on two target EEG databases. The classification performance shows TDAE significantly outperforms existing shallow and deep MW classification models. We also investigated how to select TDAE hyper-parameters and found its superiority in accuracy can be achieved with proper filter orders.

AB  - Cloud manufacturing is a kind of sharing manufacturing, and the supply–demand matching between manufacturing services and customers has become one of the most important issues for a platform. Because of the increasing complexity of customer personalization, the cognitive information from both sides becomes uncertain and fuzzy. Linguistics is used to describe uncertain preferences, especially in platforms. Also, the cloud model is adopted to convert the linguistics to reflect the randomness and fuzziness. Meanwhile, as the rapid development of communication techniques has strengthened the connections between different agents, the final matching results are affected by connections. Hence, the peer effect, which describes the mutual influences among individuals, is introduced in our study. In addition, considering the different strengths of the connections, the peer effect is improved by integrating grey relations, which are used to evaluate the diverse connections. Finally, the workload is introduced in the form of adjustment parameters. Consequently, we establish a bi-objective model that aims to maximize satisfaction and minimize the differences among individuals. To solve the mathematical model, an improved cuckoo algorithm is proposed. Additionally, the design of an air outlet grille for new-energy vehicles is taken as an example, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified.

AB  - Reservoir simulations for petroleum fields and seismic imaging are known as the most demanding workloads for high-performance computing (HPC) in the oil and gas (O&G) industry. The optimization of the simulator numerical parameters plays a vital role as it could save considerable computational efforts. State-of-the-art optimization techniques are based on running numerous simulations, specific for that purpose, to find good parameter candidates. However, using such an approach is highly costly in terms of time and computing resources. This work presents TunaOil, a new methodology to enhance the search for optimal numerical parameters of reservoir flow simulations using a performance model. In the O&G industry, it is common to use ensembles of models in different workflows to reduce the uncertainty associated with forecasting O&G production. We leverage the runs of those ensembles in such workflows to extract information from each simulation and optimize the numerical parameters in their subsequent runs. To validate the methodology, we implemented it in a history matching (HM) process that uses a Kalman filter algorithm to adjust an ensemble of reservoir models to match the observed data from the real field. We mine past execution logs from many simulations with different numerical configurations and build a machine learning model based on extracted features from the data. These features include properties of the reservoir models themselves, such as the number of active cells, to statistics of the simulation’s behavior, such as the number of iterations of the linear solver. A sampling technique is used to query the oracle to find the numerical parameters that can reduce the elapsed time without significantly impacting the quality of the results. Our experiments show that the predictions can improve the overall HM workflow runtime on average by 31%.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of technology in modern airliners brings not just advantages, but also the potential for cyber threats. Fortunately, there have been no significant attacks on civil aircraft to date, which allows the handling of these emerging threats to be approached proactively. Although an ample body of research into technical defense strategies exists, current research neglects to take the human operator into account. In this study, we present an exploratory experiment focusing on pilots confronted with a cyber-attack. Results show that the occurrence of an attack affects all dependent variables: pilots' workload, trust, eye-movements, and behavior. Pilots experiencing an attack report heavier workload and weakened trust in the system than pilots whose aircraft is not under attack. Further, pilots who experienced an attack monitored basic flying instruments less and their performance deteriorated. A warning about a potential attack seems to moderate several of those effects. Our analysis prompts us to recommend incorporating cyber-awareness into pilots' recurrent training; we also argue that one has to consider all affected personnel when designing such training. Future research should target the development of appropriate procedures and training techniques to prepare pilots to correctly identify and respond to cyber-attacks.

AB  - Identifying the abnormal changes of mental workload (MWL) over time is quite crucial for preventing the accidents due to cognitive overload and inattention of human operators in safety-critical human–machine systems. It is known that various neuroimaging technologies can be used to identify the MWL variations. In order to classify MWL into a few discrete levels using representative MWL indicators and small-sized training samples, a novel EEG-based approach by combining locally linear embedding (LLE), support vector clustering (SVC) and support vector data description (SVDD) techniques is proposed and evaluated by using the experimentally measured data. The MWL indicators from different cortical regions are first elicited by using the LLE technique. Then, the SVC approach is used to find the clusters of these MWL indicators and thereby to detect MWL variations. It is shown that the clusters can be interpreted as the binary class MWL. Furthermore, a trained binary SVDD classifier is shown to be capable of detecting slight variations of those indicators. By combining the two schemes, a SVC–SVDD framework is proposed, where the clear-cut (smaller) cluster is detected by SVC first and then a subsequent SVDD model is utilized to divide the overlapped (larger) cluster into two classes. Finally, three-class MWL levels (low, normal and high) can be identified automatically. The experimental data analysis results are compared with those of several existing methods. It has been demonstrated that the proposed framework can lead to acceptable computational accuracy and has the advantages of both unsupervised and supervised training strategies.

The proposed mathematical formulation is used in an exact solution framework based on logic-based Benders decomposition. The proposed approach decomposes the problem into a workload-assignment master problem and operation-sequence slave subproblems. Logic-based cuts are proposed to ensure the convergence of the approach. Computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach.

AB  - Annotating a large-scale image dataset is very tedious, yet necessary for training person re-identification (re-ID) models. To alleviate such a problem, we present an active redundancy reduction (ARR) framework via training an effective re-ID model with the least labeling efforts. The proposed ARR framework actively selects informative and diverse samples for annotation by estimating their uncertainty and intra-diversity, thus it can significantly reduce the annotation workload. Moreover, we propose a computer-assisted identity recommendation module embedded in the ARR framework to help human annotators to rapidly and accurately label the selected samples. Extensive experiments were carried out on several public re-ID datasets to demonstrate the existence of data redundancy. Experimental results indicate that our method can reduce 57%, 63%, and 49% annotation efforts on the Market1501, MSMT17, and CUHK03, respectively, while maximizing the performance of the re-ID model.

AB  - Fatigue is an important workplace risk management issue. Within the rail industry, the passing of a stop signal (signal passed at danger; SPAD) is considered to be one of the most major safety breaches which can occur. Train drivers are very aware of the negative consequences associated with a SPAD. Therefore, SPADs provide a practical and applied safety relevant context within which to structure a discussion on fatigue. Focus groups discussing contributing factors to SPADs were undertaken at eight passenger rail organisations across Australia and New Zealand (n = 28 drivers). Data relating to fatigue was extracted and inductively analysed identifying three themes: causes, consequences, and countermeasures (to fatigue). Drivers experienced negative consequences of fatigue, despite existing countermeasures to mitigate it. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue management. A fatigue assessment tool consistently informed rostering, however, shift swapping was commonplace and often unregulated, reducing any potential positive impact. In discussing fatigue countermeasure strategies, drivers talked interchangeably about mitigating task related fatigue (e.g. increasing cognitive load) and sleepiness (e.g. caffeine). Ensuring the concepts of fatigue and sleepiness are properly understood has the potential to maximise safety.

AB  - Conventional Air Traffic Control is still predominantly being done by human Air Traffic Controllers, however, as the traffic density increases, the workload of the controllers increases as well. Especially for the area of unmanned aviation, driven by the rise in drones, having human controllers might become unfeasible. One of the methods that is currently being investigated for replacing the conflict resolution task of Air Traffic Control is Reinforcement Learning. As violation of the required separation margins, also called an intrusion, is an event of relatively low frequency, using Reinforcement Learning for this task comes with difficulties that can potentially be attributed to data imbalance. This paper artificially increased the traffic density during the training phase of the Reinforcement Learning method to investigate what the importance is of a balanced data set on the performance of the Reinforcement Learning method. It was found that as the traffic density increased, the Reinforcement Learning methods started to outperform the analytical methods. Beyond this it was found that methods trained at higher traffic densities, but tested at lower traffic densities, outperformed the methods trained at that specific density. This indicates that it might be better to always ensure that the training scenarios are more complex than anticipated during the execution phase, even if that results in unrealistic scenarios.

AB  - With the growing implementation and use of health IT such as Clinical Decision Support (CDS), there is increasing attention on the potential negative impact of these technologies on patients (e.g., medication errors) and clinicians (e.g., increased workload, decreased job satisfaction, burnout). Human-Centered Design (HCD) and Human Factors (HF) principles are recommended to improve the usability of health IT and reduce its negative impact on patients and clinicians; however, challenges persist. The objective of this study is to understand how an HCD process influences the usability of health IT. We conducted a systematic retrospective analysis of the HCD process used in the design of a CDS for pulmonary embolism diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). Guided by the usability outcomes (e.g., barriers and facilitators) of the CDS use “in the wild” (see Part 1 of this research in the accompanying manuscript), we performed deductive content analysis of 17 documents (e.g., design session transcripts) produced during the HCD process. We describe if and how the design team considered the barriers and facilitators during the HCD process. We identified 7 design outcomes of the HCD process, for instance designing a workaround and making a design change to the CDS. We identify gaps in the current HCD process and demonstrate the need for a continuous health IT design process.

AB  - This paper explores concepts and pilot studies for realizing autonomous and disaster-resistant infrastructures through integrating cognitive and self-deployable load-bearing structural components. These components act as secondary, and independent structural systems, that allow civil construction to autonomously reconfigure their internal structure to adapt to severe loading conditions in real-time. As a result, an autonomous infrastructure can achieve higher levels of structural resilience under extreme events (i.e. fire, earthquake etc.). This improved performance mitigates premature failure (collapse), thus providing occupants with sufficient time to evacuate, and allowing first responders to tackle the adverse effects of disasters. The practicality of the proposed concepts is illustrated through a comprehensive case study that covers fundamental aspects of structural performance and human evacuation in a super-tall 80-storey high-rise building undergoing an extreme event.

Particularly, visibility issue (i.e. blind spots) has been recognized as one of the primary reasons for construction equipment related accidents and injuries. Although attempts have been made to alleviate the problem by providing external assistance to operators and laborers, being struck by objects and equipment remains the third leading cause of construction fatalities (behind falls and transportation incidents) for the past decade. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of how operators respond to the external assistance has great potential to improve operation safety from a human-centered perspective. This paper highlights a promising method of employing external views that provides additional spatial information to overcome the visibility problem. Challenges are discussed in human spatial ability-related aspects such as the additional spatial information may increase mental workload and introduce difficulties in processing the information. At last, potential research directions and experiments are discussed.

AB  - Human experimentation investigating the contribution of limb movement frequency in determining the fast exercise drive to breathe has produced controversial findings. To evaluate the role of limb movement frequency in determining the fast exercise drive to breathe, endurance runners and recreationally-active controls performed two sinusoidal exercise protocols on a cycle ergometer. One protocol was performed at constant workload with sinusoidal pedaling cadence, and a second with sinusoidal workload at constant cadence. Metabolic rate (VO2) increases and means were matched between these two experiments. The ventilatory response was significantly faster when limb movement speed was varied, compared to when pedal loading was varied (18.49±15.6s vs. 50.5±14.5s, p<0.05). Ventilation response amplitudes were significantly higher during pedal cadence variation versus pedal loading variation (3.99±0.25 vs. 2.58±0.17L/min, p<0.05). Similar findings were obtained for endurance athletes, with significantly attenuated ventilation responses to exercise versus control subjects. We conclude that fast changes in limb movement frequency are a potent stimulus for ventilation at submaximal workloads, and that this response is susceptible to attenuation through training.

AB  - The influence of digitalisation on service experiences requires new capabilities from customers. In particular, the computer-mediated interaction affects customers' perceived accessibility into self-services. Thus, we posed the following research question: “How does an individual's ability to use a computer influence the need for direct person-to-person interaction in services?” The study is based on a postal survey conducted in south-eastern Finland. Data were collected using a random sample of N = 3000 people ranging from 60 to 90 years of age. A total of 1121 valid responses were received. The data were slightly biased towards respondents who are coping well. We employed structural equation modelling with a multi-group moderation approach in the analysis. The findings indicate that satisfaction is related to routines in the service process. Customers' ability to perform the requisite role in the service process influences their preference for human interaction. Interestingly, the value of human interaction is driven by customers' expected abilities, whereas physical restrictions have a minor influence. We contribute to the literature explaining co-creation in computer-mediated services by applying human behaviour models to assess the customers’ value expectations.

AB  - Evaluating an operator's mental workload during work activities is crucial to maintain safety and performance. By minimizing human error associated with work demands, especially in a hazardous environment, potentially serious errors may be avoided. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using an in-ear EEG system to classify the user's state in a visuomotor tracking task that may influence mental workload and motor action. A two-channel wireless in-ear EEG system was used to record EEG signals while subjects performed the task using a joystick to manipulate an object displayed on a monitor. A highly comparative time series analysis was employed on the processed signals to extract and select the top features for each subject individually. The features sets were trained and tested with support vector machines, random forest, linear discriminant analysis, subspace discriminant, and neural network to compare their performances. Models trained on two trials, each 14 minutes in duration and tested on the other trial were able to yield an accuracy of 79.30 ± 4.85% on average across the ten participants with an individualized moving average threshold filter and classifier. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using a two-channel wireless in-ear EEG system as a viable solutions to develop wearable devices to detect mental workload associated with the execution of visuomotor tasks.

AB  - Powered exoskeletons have been shown to significantly reduce physical workload during occupational tasks. Due to this they have great potential impact on future labor practices. However, powered exoskeleton controllers must first be developed that are able to directly assist with task objectives and truly collaborate with users. To address this need we present a shared autonomy control framework that separates the human and exoskeleton control objectives. This allows for creating a feedback-based exoskeleton controller that will help accomplish the user’s task goals rather than just assisting in specific motions. We introduce Positive Power control for the human-based controller that is designed to allow the human to directly command work that accomplishes the desired task. While a standard robotic controller can be used for the feedback-based control, we introduce ‘acceptance’ as a measure of how well the exoskeleton’s control objective matches the human’s. Both control objectives are implemented in an optimization-based Whole-Body-Control structure. Finally, we introduce a method to update the exoskeleton’s objectives to match the humans’ such that after operating for a time the exoskeleton can learn to assist the user in accomplishing their task. This framework is implemented on a 10-DoF upper-body powered exoskeleton. The results verify that the control framework works as desired and can form a basis for developing extended methods for directly improving cooperative control for powered exoskeletons.

AB  - In the decades before the advent of computers, humans tend to make mistakes while calculating and remembering tasks. Distributed computing helped to reduce the workload of each computer by distributing the workload evenly among computers connected in the network. Cloud computing have eradicated most of the problems that occurred in distributed computing but were also prone to different types of issues. Major issues in cloud computing relate to security and load balancing. Load balance of a node relates to two important parameters namely request time and response time. Meta heuristics algorithms can be used to provide proper load balancing techniques in cloud. This paper provides a mechanism namely EMAMBO to ensure that each node is properly load-balanced in cloud. Based on different metrics considered, it could be inferred that the proposed system fares better when compared to different benchmarked existing systems.

AB  - In the recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) services has been increasingly applied to promote the quality of the human life and this trend is predicted to stretch for into future. With the recent advancements in IoT technology, fog computing is emerging as a distributed computing model to support IoT functionality. Since the IoT services will experience workload fluctuations over time, it is important to automatically provide the proper number of sufficient fog resources to address the workload changes of IoT services to avoid the over- or under-provisioning problems, meeting the QoS requirements at the same time. In this paper, an efficient resource provisioning approach is presented. This approach is inspired by autonomic computing model using Bayesian learning technique to make decisions about the increase and decrease in the dynamic scaling fog resources to accommodate the workload from IoT services in the fog computing environment. Also, we design an autonomous resource provisioning framework based on the generic fog environment three-tier architecture. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our solution under three workload traces. The simulation results indicate that the proposed solution reduces the total cost and delay violation, and increases the fog node utilization compared with the other methods.

AB  - This paper describes an experiment that was undertaken to compare three levels of automation in rail signalling; a high level in which an automated agent set routes for trains using timetable information, a medium level in which trains were routed along pre-defined paths, and a low level where the operator (signaller) was responsible for the movement of all trains. These levels are described in terms of a Rail Automation Model based on previous automation theory (Parasuraman et al., 2000). Performance, subjective workload, and signaller activity were measured for each level of automation running under both normal operating conditions and abnormal, or disrupted, conditions. The results indicate that perceived workload, during both normal and disrupted phases of the experiment, decreased as the level of automation increased and performance was most consistent (i.e. showed the least variation between participants) with the highest level of automation. The results give a strong case in favour of automation, particularly in terms of demonstrating the potential for automation to reduce workload, but also suggest much benefit can achieved from a mid-level of automation potentially at a lower cost and complexity.

AB  - Collective decision making is essential for multicellular and self-organized society coordination, but how this occurs when most of the individuals have limited knowledge of the external environment remains elusive. Using empirical data to inform a neuroscience-based firing-rate model, we found that integration of negative feedback and network dynamics in a honeybee, Apis mellifera, hive demonstrates strong similarities to the neuronal interactions of the human brain, where very brief perturbations of feedback in the system result in more rapid and accurate decisions. We show that honey bees used an inhibitory ‘stop’ signal towards dancing honey bees that reduced both waggle dancing and waggle dance pheromone production. Stop signals were probably elicited by individuals with no individual knowledge of food quality change in the external environment. Therefore, we demonstrate that collective behaviour across different biological levels of organization exhibits a dynamic complex system that is self-organized, but is governed by simple feedback mechanisms, facilitating efficient group decision making by optimally aggregating individuals that have relatively limited cognitive capabilities within a society or cell in a multicellular organism. We discuss how despite being on two different levels of biological organization, both neurons in the brain and honeybee individuals, within the hive, can operate collectively, which is probably a result of convergent evolution.

AB  - Solving complex real-world optimization problems is a computationally demanding task. To solve it efficiently and effectively, one must possess expert knowledge in various fields (problem domain knowledge, optimization, parallel and distributed computing) and appropriate expensive software and hardware resources. In this regard, we present a cloud-native, container-based distributed optimization framework that enables efficient and cost-effective optimization over platforms such as Amazon ECS/EKS, Azure AKS, and on-premise Kubernetes. The solution consists of dozens of microservices scaled out using a specially developed PETAS Auto-scaler based on predictive analytics. Existing schedulers, whether Kubernetes or commercial, do not take into account the specifics of optimization based on evolutionary algorithms. Therefore, their performance is not optimal in terms of results’ delivery time and cloud infrastructure costs. The proposed PETAS Auto-scaler elastically maintains an adequate number of worker pods following the exact pace dictated by the demands of the optimization process. We evaluate the proposed framework’s performance using two real-world computationally demanding optimizations. The first use case belongs to the manufacturing domain and involves optimization of the transportation pallets for train parts. The second use case belongs to the field of automated machine learning and includes neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization. The results indicate an IaaS cost savings of up to 49% can be achieved, with almost unchanged result delivery time.

AB  - As a worker-centred assembly mode developed in the electronics industry in Japan, seru is receiving growing attention due to improved flexibility and responsiveness. In seru implementation, cross-trained worker assignment is a vital problem. Most previous studies focused on assigning cross-trained workers into pure divisional or rotating seru separately, but overlooked the problem for a hybrid seru production system that includes both seru types. This research fills this gap by minimizing the makespan and balancing the workers’ workload of each seru in a bi-objective mathematical model. For medium-scale instances, the exact solutions are obtained. For large-scale instances, we propose an NSGA-II-based memetic algorithm that uses two-level encoding and incorporates the bat algorithm as a local search and two K-means-based NSGA-II algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that the K-means-based NSGA-II not only outperforms other algorithms with respect to common proximity and diversity metrics but also runs an order of magnitude faster (in seconds versus minutes required by others on the same computer). Some management insights are obtained based on many numerical experiments.

AB  - Evaluation of operator Mental Workload (MW) levels via ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) is quite promising in Human-Machine (HM) collaborative task environment to alarm the temporal operator performance degradation. However, accurate recognition of MW states via a static pattern classifier with training and testing EEG signals recoded on separate days is particularly challenging as EEG features are differently distributed across different sessions. Motivated by the superiority of the deep learning approaches for stable feature abstractions in higher levels, an adaptive Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder (SDAE) is developed to tackling such cross-session MW classification task in which the weights of the shallow hidden neurons could be adaptively updated during the testing procedure. The generalization capability of the adaptive SDAE is first evaluated under within/cross-session conditions. Then, we compare it with the state of the art MW classifiers under different feature selection and the noise corruption paradigms. The results indicate a higher performance of the adaptive SDAE in dealing with the cross-session EEG features. By analyzing the optimal step length, the data augmentation scheme and the computational cost for iterative tuning, the adaptive SDAE is also demonstrated to be acceptable for online implementation.

AB  - This study proposes a framework that accounts for mental workload and available sight distances to estimate advisory speed limits on horizontal curves. To achieve this goal, automated scripts were used to extract data on horizontal curve elements (i.e., the degree of curvature and the deflection angle), to detect crest vertical curves, and to compute the available sight distance from remote sensing data collected on highways in Alberta, Canada. Mental workload ratings were then assigned to each horizontal curve to calculate the perception–reaction time needed by drivers to maintain control of their vehicles while negotiating these curves. Finally, a curve advisory speed was calculated based on the available sight distance and the mental workload perception–reaction time needed to ensure a safe driving environment. This study presents a unique approach that incorporates human factors, including the responses of drivers based on their perception of the driving environment, in the development of speed advisory systems.
Cette étude propose un cadre qui tient compte de la charge de travail mental et des distances de visibilité disponibles pour estimer les limites de vitesse recommandées dans les courbes horizontales. Pour atteindre cet objectif, des scripts automatisés ont été utilisés pour extraire des données sur les éléments de courbes horizontales (c.-à-d. le degré de courbure et l’angle de déflexion), pour détecter les courbes verticales de crête, et calculer la distance de visibilité disponible à partir des données de télédétection recueillies sur les routes de l’Alberta, au Canada. Des cotes de charge de travail mental ont ensuite été attribuées à chaque courbe horizontale pour calculer le temps de perception–réaction nécessaire aux conducteurs pour garder le contrôle de leur véhicule tout en franchissant ces courbes. Enfin, on a calculé la vitesse recommandée en courbe en fonction de la distance de visibilité disponible et du temps de la charge de travail mental de perception–réaction nécessaire pour assurer un environnement de conduite sécuritaire. Cette étude présente une approche unique qui intègre les facteurs humains, y compris les réponses des conducteurs en fonction de leur perception de l’environnement de conduite, dans le développement de systèmes-conseil de vitesse.

AB  - This paper presents a Shared Control Architecture (SCA) between a human pilot and a smart inceptor for nonlinear Pilot Induced Oscillations (PIOs), e.g., category II or III PIOs. One innovation of this paper is that an intelligent shared control architecture is developed based on the intelligent active inceptor technique, i.e., Smart Adaptive Flight Effective Cue (SAFE-Cue). A deep reinforcement learning approach namely Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method is chosen to design a gain adaptation mechanism for the SAFE-Cue module. By doing this, the gains of the SAFE-Cue will be intelligently tuned once nonlinear PIOs triggered; meanwhile, the human pilot will receive a force cue from the SAFE-Cue, and will consequently adapting his/her control policy. The second innovation of this paper is that the reward function of the DDPG based gain adaptation approach is constructed according to flying qualities. Under the premise of considering failure situation, task completion qualities and pilot workload are also taken into account. Finally, the proposed approach is validated using numerical simulation experiments with two types of scenarios: lower actuator rate limits and airframe damages. The Inceptor Peak Power-Phase (IPPP) metric is adopted to analyze the human-vehicle system simulation results. Results and analysis show that the DDPG based sharing control approach can well address nonlinear PIO problems consisting of Categories II and III PIO events.

AB  - Background:
The effect of policy and managerial decisions on nurse-workload, and subsequent quality-of-care, are difficult to quantify in advance. A tool is needed that can proactively test these changes — Discrete Event Simulation (DES) may help. While computerized simulation models have existed before, there remains a gap to affirm the validity of these models.
Objective:
Develop an approach to creating a valid computerized simulation model that quantifies the effects of operational decisions on nurse-workload and quality-of-care.
Methods:
The DES model simulates the process of care delivery for nurses on a task-by-task basis. In an effort to validate this approach, the DES model was adapted to a real-world medical-surgical unit. Model inputs include: historical patient-care data; unit-layout; and programming logic, developed via focus-groups. Nurse-workload outcomes were distance-walked, task-in-queue, direct-care time, and nurse-movement. Quality-of-care outcomes included missed-care; and care-task waiting-time. The model is validated via internal validity checks and a field study that consisted of a ‘step-counter study’, a ‘MISSCARE survey’, ‘nurse job shadowing’, and a ‘time and motion study’. An Intraclass-correlation (ICC) and Spearman ranked correlation analysis were used to compare modelling outcomes to field-study outcomes.
Results:
The DES model, when adapted to a real-world medical-surgical unit, has been validated. The ICC coefficients show an “excellent” agreement of 0.99, 0.99, 0.85, 0.85, 0.84 between simulation and real-world outcomes, along with a “good” agreement of 0.86 for Spearman ranked correlation. Specific modelling results include a ‘distance walked’ of 7 to 10.6 km with a ‘direct care time’ of 8.3 to 10.4 h with a total of 77 to 84 trips for an average of 12 to 15 ‘tasks in queue’. Quality-of-care was represented by a ‘care task waiting time’ of 0.9 to 1 h that lead to 25 to 31 ‘missed-care’ tasks, where, 27% were ‘non-patient care’; and ‘missed-care delivery time’ was 2 to 2.9 h.
Conclusion:
This research provides a decision support-system that can help test and inform healthcare system policies that support both care quality and safety. By validating the DES model of a medical-surgical unit, we suggest that the modelling approach will also yield valid result when applied in similar settings. However, the modelling approach needs to be adapted to other healthcare settings and tested before concluding that this approach will consistently yield valid models.

AB  - In-vehicle human machine interfaces (HMI) represent a promising approach for informing drivers what they should do to adopt an eco-safe driving style, which is associated with reduced fuel consumption and improved safety. However, there is limited understanding of the driver acceptance of various types of in-vehicle HMIs and the impact of such systems on driving behaviour. Forty drivers participated in a simulated driving experiment to evaluate three variations of an eco-safe in-vehicle HMI: visual advice only; visual feedback only; or visual advice and feedback. To evaluate the impact of the different HMIs, subjective and objective measures were analysed, including fuel consumption, eco-safe driving behaviour, driver acceptance, and workload. Results indicate that all system types were associated with the relatively high levels of driver acceptance, with the advice only system accepted the most. While all system types produced relatively low levels of workload for drivers, systems involving feedback significantly increased the workload associated with using the interface. The findings suggest that the combined advice and feedback system has the potential to simultaneously reduce fuel consumption and improve eco-safe driving behaviour. Specifically, both advice and feedback appeared to be critical in encouraging positive changes in eco-safe driving behaviour. Our contribution can inform the design and development of future in-vehicle HMIs to improve eco-safe driving style that are accepted by drivers and have minimal adverse impacts on driver workload.

AB  - Current technology has made it possible to automate a number of agricultural processes that were traditionally carried out by humans and now can be entirely performed by robotic platforms. However, there are certain tasks like soft fruit harvesting, where human skills are still required. In this case, the robot’s job is to cooperate/collaborate with human workers to alleviate their physical workload and improve harvesting efficiency. To accomplish that in a safe and reliable way, the robot should incorporate a safety system whose main goal is to reduce the risk of harming human co-workers during close human–robot interaction (HRI). In this context, this paper presents a theoretical study, addressing the safety risks of using collaborative robots in agricultural scenarios, especially in HRI situations when the robot’s safety system is not completely reliable and a component may fail. The agricultural scenarios discussed in this paper include automatic harvesting, logistics operations, crop monitoring, and plant treatment using UV-C light. A human injury assessment is conducted based on converting the HRI in each agricultural scenario into a formal mathematical representation. This representation is later implemented in a probabilistic model-checking tool. We then use this tool to perform a sensitivity analysis that allows us to determine the probability that a human may get injured according to the occurrence of failures in the robot’s safety or perception systems. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that an agricultural robot with a robust human perception system can still harm people if they are not well-trained to interact with the robot for certain scenarios. This illustrates how the probabilistic modeling methodology presented in this work can be used by safety engineers as a guideline to construct their own HRI models and then use the results of the model-checking to enhance the safety and reliability of their robot’s safety system architectures and on-site safety policies.

AB  - Monitoring mental load for optimal performance has become increasingly central with the recently evolving need to cope with exponentially increasing amounts of data. This paper describes a non-intrusive, objective method to estimate mental workload in an immersive virtual reality system, through analysis of frequencies of pupil fluctuations. We tested changes in mental workload with a number of task-repetitions, level of predictability of the task and the effect of prior experience in predictable task performance, on mental workload of unpredictable task performance. Two measures were used to calculate mental workload: the ratio of Low Frequency to High Frequency components of pupil fluctuations, and the High Frequency alone, all extracted from the Power Spectrum Density of pupil fluctuations. Results show that mental workload decreases with a number of repetitions, creating a mode in which the brain acts as an automatic controller. Automaticity during training occurs only after a minimal number of repetitions, which once achieved, resulted in further improvements in the performance of unpredictable motor tasks, following training in a predictable task. These results indicate that automaticity is a central component in the transfer of skills from highly predictable to low predictable motor tasks. Our results suggest a potentially applicable method to brain–computer-interface systems that adapt to human mental workload, and provide intelligent automated support for enhanced performance.

AB  - Guiding multiple UAVs equipped with state-of-the-art automation by just one pilot usually means a large number and variety of supervision and monitoring tasks, interrupted by time-critical re-planning and reconfiguration tasks as reaction to unexpected events. To support pilots, especially in critical workload situations, by a cognitive associate system requires the machine awareness of the actual task the operator is working on, and the ability to detect critical workload situations to initiate assistant system interventions. This article describes an approach of building human operator behavior models to determine both, the current task of the operator, and derivations in task accomplishment, the latter observable by self-adapting strategies exposed during high workload conditions. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted utilizing a virtual flight simulator to stimulate pilot's workload during the guidance of multiple UAVs and to record their manual and visual interactions. These interactions represent the input data to train task specific operator behavior models by applying the Hidden Markov theory. Using Hidden Markov based behavior models allows the inference of tasks and their derivations from observable operator interactions. In this article, we describe the experimental findings, the methods applied, and the modelling approach.

AB  - Scheduling is an important decision-making process for manufacturing companies. Shop scheduling is a subsection of scheduling related to manufacturing shops. The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) aims to minimize the makespan of a product value of the production process. This issue is related to optimizing the sequence of the jobs on appropriate machines. With globalization, manufacturing shops are scattered around the world. The distributed job shop scheduling problem (DJSP) tries to solve the optimizing sequence on these scattered facilities. DJSP is more complex than JSP. DJSP is solved by exact and heuristic solvers. Exact solvers more time-consuming processes for huge problems. In this work, a discrete version of the spotted hyena optimizer (DSHO) is proposed for solving DJSP. A workload-based facility order mechanism and a greedy heuristic approach are combined with the DSHO algorithm. 80 distributed job shop scheduling problems (DJSP) are solved by DSHO. For evaluating the performance of the DSHO, numerical results of the 480 (2 facilities to 7 facilities) large instances that are derived from well-known JSP benchmarks are compared with four different discrete meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results are shown that DSHO is a pioneer solver for DJSP.

AB  - Introduction
Primary care is complex due to multiple health problems being addressed in each patient visit. Little is known about the effect of the number of problems per encounter (NPPE) on the resulting clinician workload (CWL), as measured using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).
Methods
We evaluated the relationship between NPPE and CWL across 608 adult patient visits, conducted by 31 clinicians, using hierarchical linear regression. Clinicians were interviewed about outlier visits to identify reasons for higher or lower than expected CWL.
Results
Mean NPPE was 3.30 ± 2.0 (sd) and CWL was 47.6 ± 18.4 from a maximum of 100. Mental demand, time demand and effort accounted for 71.5% of CWL. After adjustment for confounders, each additional problem increased CWL by 3.9 points (P < 0.001). Patient, problem, environmental and patient-physician relationship factors were qualitatively identified from interviews as moderators of this effect.
Conclusion
CWL is positively related to NPPE. Several modifiable factors may enhance or mitigate this effect. Our findings have implications for using a Human Factors (HF) approach to managing CWL.

AB  - Object tracking is one of the major tasks for mobile robots in many real-world applications. Also, artificial intelligence and automatic control techniques play an important role in enhancing the performance of mobile robot navigation. In contrast to previous simulation studies, this paper presents a new intelligent mobile robot for accomplishing multi-tasks by tracking red-green-blue (RGB) colored objects in a real experimental field. Moreover, a practical smart controller is developed based on adaptive fuzzy logic and custom proportional-integral-derivative (PID) schemes to achieve accurate tracking results, considering robot command delay and tolerance errors. The design of developed controllers implies some motion rules to mimic the knowledge of experienced operators. Twelve scenarios of three colored object combinations have been successfully tested and evaluated by using the developed controlled image-based robot tracker. Classical PID control failed to handle some tracking scenarios in this study. The proposed adaptive fuzzy PID control achieved the best accurate results with the minimum average final error of 13.8 cm to reach the colored targets, while our designed custom PID control is efficient in saving both average time and traveling distance of 6.6 s and 14.3 cm, respectively. These promising results demonstrate the feasibility of applying our developed image-based robotic system in a colored object-tracking environment to reduce human workloads.

AB  - The production of electronic waste, also known as e-waste, has risen with the growing reliance on electronic products. To reduce negative environmental impact and achieve sustainable industrial processes, recovering and reusing products is crucial. Advances in AI and robotics can help in this effort by reducing workload for human workers and allowing them to stay away from hazardous materials. However, autonomous human motion/intention perception is a primary barrier in e-waste remanufacturing. To address the research gap, this study combined experimental data collection with deep learning models for accurate disassembly task recognition. Over 570,000 frames of motion data were collected from inertial measurement units (IMU) worn by 22 participants. A novel sequence-based correction (SBC) algorithm was also proposed to further improve the accuracy of the overall pipeline. Results showed that models (CNN, LSTM, and GoogLeNet) had an overall accuracy of 88–92%. The proposed SBC algorithm improved accuracy to 95%.

AB  - A flexible tooling for one-dimensional (1D) lattice truss composite structure (LTCS) was presented. To facilitate the tooling design, the design of its key parts was mathematically modeled. Additionally, to reduce the consolidation workloads, a local consolidation method was employed. In the locally-consolidated specimen, aramid threads are only wrapped around longitudinal members, which can reduce at least two-thirds time required by the entire consolidation process. Using the flexible tooling and adopting entire consolidation, local consolidation and non-consolidation processes, 1D LTCS specimens were manufactured. Compression tests were carried out to evaluate their mechanical performances. The test results indicate that the local consolidation method captures 48% improvement in compression strength compared to the non-consolidated specimen, and does not weaken the compressive stiffness and strength compared to the entire consolidation process.

AB  - The pandemic of coronavirus has dramatically disrupted the retail industry, as many stores are forced to close and people across the world are shelter-in-place with online shopping as the inevitable choice. To meet the rapidly increasing demand for e-commerce, more data centers are expected to provide new or significantly improve existing cloud services that can better support hybrid workloads (e.g. online purchase jobs and batch jobs that support ranking or recommendation systems). Successful cloud systems need to efficiently handle and quickly respond to huge volume of traffic with such hybrid workloads. Meanwhile, it is critical to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) for profitability. Improving system utilization is one of the effective techniques to achieve the twin goals of high performance and low TCO. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis on the 2017 and 2018 cluster traces released by Alibaba, which provides a case study about Alibaba's best practices in improving the performance and cost efficiency of its large-scale cloud systems by consolidating time-sensitive online service jobs with time-insensitive batch jobs. Our investigation indicates that the over-subscription (causing resource waste and low utilization) and under-subscription (causing performance degradation) problems co-exist in the current Alibaba system. We develop a simulator that allows us to evaluate possible solutions to address this problem and their impact on the performance, energy consumption, and TCO. Our experiments show that the estimated TCO can be reduced by $600,000 for the 2018 trace running on over 4,000 machines without compromising performance. The TCO can decrease by nearly $68 million if similar strategy is extrapolated to Alibaba's 432,000 web facing servers.

Although lot-sizing decisions can have a significant impact on required manual material handling and on human performance, works that consider ergonomic aspects in lot-sizing are rare. This paper presents a model that integrates ergonomic aspect in terms of human energy expenditure and rest allowance in a traditional lot-sizing model. The behavior of the model is analyzed in a numerical study, showing its ability to reflect manual workload, and that ergonomic aspects should be considered in lot-sizing decisions.

AB  - While Applied Ergonomics practitioners are still working on the reduction of physical workload for the sake of the workforce Sports Science and other Life Sciences found that our problem is in contrast a sedentary lifestyle, which contributes to the increase in diseases of civilization. In particular in aging populations workability is suffering increasingly from these epidemiological facts. Mainly Human Resources departments take care of this problem in Occupational Health Management programs, organizing activities, which do not touch, however, the work processes themselves. In work system design and Ergonomics, on the other hand the problem of providing a minimum of mobility and resistance during work is not addressed. The tools applied in ergonomic design provide typically upper limits of workload and do not limit workload at the lower end. Some of them are over-conservative, enforcing mechanization and automation, restricting unnecessarily the flexibility in design and preventing positive physical workload. This paper discusses the potentials and risks of integrating added motion and resistance into work processes in order to achieve a balanced physical load situation for staff members. For this purpose, it combines findings from Life Sciences with those of Ergonomics and suggests how to approach the required minimal physical load problem. An Added Time Concept (ATC) and Work Process Redesign (WPR) are proposed and discussed for supporting a balanced physical load. It is shown that such concepts can only be implemented based on an individual physical load management. It is also shown that WPR alone will not suffice to fulfill physical activity recommendations. It has to be combined with ATC and work separated training concepts (STC). WPR works best in case the workplace design provides for configurable or adaptive physical workload. Furthermore, it is concluded that more research on recommendable physical workload is needed and that the prevailing paradigms in Ergonomics have to be re-discussed in that respect.

AB  - Background
Cross-institutional (external) referrals are prone to communication breakdowns, increasing patient safety risks, clinician burnout, and healthcare costs. To close these external referral loops, referring primary care physicians (PCPs) need to receive patient information from consultants at different healthcare institutions. Although existing studies investigated the early phases of external referral loops, we lack sufficient knowledge about the closing phases of these loops. This knowledge could allow health care institutions to improve care coordination and rates of closed referral loops by implementing socio-technical interventions for patient information exchange throughout a referral loop. Human factors engineering (HFE) provides a systematic approach to advance our understanding of barriers perceived by physicians. Using HFE, our objective was to characterize referring and consulting physicians’ barriers to closing referral loops and implications for care.
Methods
This qualitative cross-sectional study included semi-structured interviews with referrers and external consultants. We used the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 framework to conduct rapid qualitative analyses, determining perceived barriers and related implications. Main measures were consultants’ and referrers’ perceptions of, and experiences with, barriers to external referrals.
Results
Six referring PCPs and 12 consultants participated from two healthcare systems and four medical specialties. Physicians perceived three main barriers in external referrals: receipt of excessive and unnecessary faxed documents, missing or delayed documentation, and organizational policies regarding information privacy interfering with closing the loop. Compared to internal referrals, physicians reported increased staff burden, patient frustration, and delays in diagnosis with external referrals. Consultants reported the ability to provide the same level of care to patients with internal or external referrals. However, consultants described communication breakdowns that prohibited confirmation of follow-up plan retrieval, initiation, or effectiveness.
Conclusion
Physicians reported technological and organizational barriers to closing cross-institutional referral loops. Promises of HIE technology for external referrals have not fully materialized. Among physicians and patients, retrieval and exchange of medical information increases perceived workload, burden, and frustration. These increases are not accurately captured by traditional organizational metrics. This study provides evidence that informs future human factors engineering research to address perceived barriers and guide future HIE design or implementation.

AB  - Farming today is more complex than it has ever been. Operators are increasingly reliant on technology to aid and improve harvest performance. New harvest technology is under development that will advise harvest operators on the proper adjustment of machine harvest settings, as well as automatically adjust these machine settings without operator intervention, improving the harvest performance of the machine, and reducing the cognitive load of the operator. In this work a high-fidelity, interactive harvest combine simulator is used to understand how harvest operators currently use existing harvest technology, and to evaluate the performance improvements provided by new prototype machine control algorithms and human control interface designs. The interactive harvest simulator is used to assess an intermediate advising step for machine controls adjustment compared with a path using fully autonomous machine adjustment. Testing novel harvest technologies using the virtual environment of the combine simulator introduces a specific set of constraints and challenges that are not found in most other vehicle simulation applications, including the need for accurate physical and visual crop flow representations and a requirement for realistic machine responses to a wide variety of operator input commands. Using a high-fidelity combine simulator for testing allows unique harvest scenarios to be repeated by experienced operators in a controlled virtual environment. This study evaluates operator acceptance, performance, and feedback for two novel pieces of harvest technology, Advisor and Director. Advisor is an operator-in-the-loop system providing feedback on proper machine control adjustments during normal harvest operations. Director is designed to continuously monitor the overall harvest health and autonomously adjust the combine harvest settings. In this study, operators harvested the same virtual field twice, first using Advisor, and a second time using Director. Operators overwhelmingly perceived both the Advisor and Director systems as optimizing the harvest performance of the combine and recommended both Advisor and Director. The results presented in this work show that both systems improved the perceived harvest performance, although the Advisor was not as highly rated. Participants recommended the automated nature of Director, and both operator feedback and physiological measures indicates that this harvest technology reduced the cognitive load of the operator. This work demonstrates two main points. First, the interactive combine simulator can be used for evaluating novel harvest technology in the lab. Second, that operators can quickly acclimate to automation within the combine and were able to harvest in a more productive manner when using higher levels of automation.

AB  - This article reviews studies conducted “in the wild” that explore the “ironies of automation” in Robotic Assisted Surgery (RAS). Workload may be reduced for the surgeon, but increased for other team members, with postural stress relocated rather than reduced, and the introduction of a range of new challenges, for example, in the need to control multiple arms, with multiple instruments; and the increased demands of being physically separated from the team. Workflow disruptions were not compared with other surgeries; however, the prevalence of equipment and training disruptions differs from other types of surgeries. A consistent observation is that communication and coordination problems are relatively frequent, suggesting that the surgical team may need to be trained to use specific verbal and non-verbal cues during surgery. RAS also changes the necessary size of the operating room instrument cleaning processes. These studies demonstrate the value of clinically-based human factors engineers working alongside surgical teams to improve the delivery of RAS.

AB  - Decision aids based on artificial intelligence and machine learning can benefit human decisions and system performance, but can also provide incorrect advice, and invite operators to inappropriately rely on automation. This paper examined the extent to which example-based explanations could improve reliance on a decision aid that is based on machine learning. Participants engaged in a preventive maintenance task by providing their diagnosis of the conditions of three components of a hydraulic system. A decision aid based on machine learning provided advice but was not always reliable. Three explanation displays (baseline, normative, normative plus contrastive) were manipulated within-participants. With the normative explanation display, we found improvements in participants' decision time and subjective workload. With the addition of contrastive explanations, we found improvements in participants' hit rate and sensitivity in discriminating between correct and incorrect ML advice. Implications for the design of explainable interfaces to support human-AI interaction in data intensive environments are discussed.

AB  - Digitalization is a trend in safety-critical complex systems. It changes the way human interacts with systems. We have less empirical knowledge about its potential negative effects on human. In our study, we compared conventional and digital main control rooms (MCRs) in nuclear power plants (NPPs) from a task complexity perspective. Complexity factors in MCRs were quantified in terms of three aspects, frequency of occurrence, complexity induced by their being, and impact caused by them. A total of 69 licensed operators participated in the study. The study consists of two parts. In Part I, overall results and analysis were reported. Generally, operators in digital MCRs perceived higher frequency and higher impact of complexity factors than those in conventional MCRs, no matter in abnormal/emergency or normal situations. Operators in digital MCRs perceived higher complexity than those in conventional MCRs in abnormal/emergency situations. These findings suggest that operators in digital MCRs experience higher complexity and workload which may reduce their reliability. These findings imply that we should caution the side-effects of ubiquitous digitalization in complex industrial systems.
Relevance to industry
Digital technologies are widely deployed in the nuclear industry. They change the working environments in which operators interact with NPP systems. There is insufficient research on operator experience on the changes brought by technological developments in NPP control rooms. Our findings imply that we should take care of the potential negative effect of digitalization on operator working environments.

AB  - Given the promise for auditory-vocal systems to be less distracting and safer to use than their visual-manual counterparts, automotive manufacturers are introducing an increasing number of voice assistant-like interfaces in vehicles. However, recent studies suggest using auditory-vocal systems can be mentally taxing for drivers, and require long interaction times. Low accuracy and menu complexity are believed to negatively affect the usability of the system, but a systematic analysis of the role of different design components on driver workload and user experience within a real-world setting is missing. This study investigates the role of voice system design components in determining levels of driver workload with participants driving twelve on-road vehicles and interacting with on-board infotainment systems. Menu depth, delay times and system accuracy are recorded for twelve different auditory-vocal systems, and one aggregate score is assigned to each system. Total delay time and menu depth were found to be significant predictors of task duration time and mental workload. Longer delay times also had a direct effect on lower usability ratings, measured by the System Usability Scale and sentiment analysis. Delay times recorded on seven additional vehicles were used to validate the regression model for task duration. This study provides findings of primary importance for researchers and automotive manufacturers to be used in the assessment and development of in-vehicle auditory-vocal systems.

AB  - In the Philippines, the supply of engineering graduates produced per year is lower than the demand as local industries are becoming engineering-related. This poses a challenge to academic institutions to fill this gap. Assessment reveals low graduation rate in the Engineering programs in the Philippines, where approximately 35.4% of the students are working at the same time. With the aim to help these students prevent possible retakes, the proponents explored and analyzed the effects of workload on academic performance and the factors associated with it. NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was utilized to measure students’ workload in this study. Recommendation presented in this research are interventions to support physical and mental health to better cope in a high workload environment, which will in return translate to better work and academic performance thus an increase in graduation rate.

AB  - Virtual cellular manufacturing is an innovative way of production organization which both in the production of flexibility and efficient to meet today's rapid development of science and technology and replacement of products. The key process of the design of virtual cellular manufacturing system—cell formation is the focus of research. In order to meet the characteristics of small batch and dynamically changing market demand, this paper studies the problems of virtual cellular multi-period dynamic reconfiguration. A reconfigurable system programming model is developed. The model incorporates parameters of the problems of product dynamic demand, machine capacity, operation sequence, balanced workload, alternative routings and batch setting. The objective of mixed integer programming model is to minimize the total costs of operation, moving raw materials, inventory holding and process routes setup. Though a case study, demonstrates the feasibility and validity of the model in reality.

AB  - Air traffic controllers' (ATCos) workload often is a limiting factor for air traffic capacity. Thus, electronic support systems intend to reduce ATCos' workload. Automatic speech recognition can extract controller command elements from verbal clearances to deliver automatic input for air traffic control systems, thereby avoiding manual input. Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) with high command recognition rates and low error rates has proven to dramatically reduce ATCos’ workload and increase capacity in approach scenarios. However, ABSR needs accurate hypotheses on expected commands and accurate extractions of command annotations from utterance transcriptions to achieve the required performance. Based on the experience of implementation for approach control, a hypotheses generator and a command extractor have been developed for speech recognition applications regarding tower control communication to face current and future challenges in the aerodrome environment. Three human-in-the-loop multiple remote tower simulation studies were performed with 16 ATCos from Hungary, Lithuania, and Finland at DLR Braunschweig from 2017 to 2019. Roughly 100 h of speech with corresponding radar data were recorded. Around 6000 speech utterances resulting in 16,000 commands have been manually transcribed and annotated. Some parts of the data have been used for training prediction models and command extraction algorithms. Other parts were used for evaluation of command prediction and command extraction. The automatic command extractor achieved a command extraction rate of 96.7%. The hypotheses generator showed operational feasibility with a sufficiently low command prediction error rate of 7.3%.

AB  - This methodological paper presents a novel approach to predict operator's mechanical exposure and fatigue accumulation in discrete event simulations. A biomechanical model of work-cycle loading is combined with a discrete event simulation model which provides work cycle patterns over the shift resulting in a load-time trace for the entire shift. This trace was tested with four different muscle endurance-recovery model pairs yielding a fatigue-time history for the entire shift. An electronics assembly case with shift-long perceived fatigue data was compared to the simulation model results. Sensitivity testing of the input work-rest ratios found the best correlation (r2 = 0.84) at 17% of the modeled rest level. The need for this adjustment is discussed in terms of limitations of available muscle endurance and recovery models. Muscle model limitations notwithstanding, this approach allows system designers to understand the mechanical exposure and fatigue-related effects of proposed alternatives in system design stages and can contribute to ‘Virtual Human Factors’ approaches for pro-active ergonomics capability.
Relevance to Industry
This paper demonstrates an approach to quantifying operator exposure patterns and fatigue levels using dynamic simulations of the proposed operations. This allows system designers to understand the ergonomic impacts of proposed alternatives in system design. Design level tools allow early stage application of ergonomics where costs are lower and solution options are greatest.

The Objective of this research is insert social aspects, considered dynamic, in a LNG control room project based on ISO 11064, EEMUA201. After identification of risks in the technology, a discussion is begun about social and cognitive risks where we can find the causes to cognition failure. The quality of social and cognitive functions are identified and adjusted to result in desired group profile. After understanding how work the operation, what are the requirements to work, job organization at site, what are the safety culture and organization aspects, the critical activities, the rules, and the risk sceneries at project, we need to understand the regional legislation, stereotypes, and local archetypes with respective rules of behaviour. Some aspects of project can be adjusted with social-cognitive demands as alarm management, layout of control room, and information management. Some ergonomic aspects need to be discussed in crossing with social and cognitive characteristics. Screen information and respective density, alarm organization, layout, number of screens, feedback, clarity, standardization, automation, and complexity are aspects maybe actuate in different way, depending on social aspects cognitive and their impacts. Using social-human techniques we can find these relations and after a test can suggest approaches in criteria from EMUA and ISO. The social aspects that are discussed and that impact on cognitive functions are: excess flexibility, paternalism, centralism, regionalism, cooperation level, and multiculturalism at work.

AB  - The rapid progress of autonomous driving (AD) has triggered a surge in demand for safer and more efficient autonomous vehicles, owing to the intricacy of modern urban environments. Traditional approaches to autonomous driving have heavily relied on conventional machine learning methodologies, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for tasks such as perception, decision-making, and control. Presently, major companies such as Tesla, Waymo, Uber, and Volkswagen Group (VW) leverage neural networks for advanced perception and autonomous decision-making. However, concerns have been raised about the escalating computational requirements of training these neural models, primarily in terms of energy consumption and environmental impact. In the situation of optimisation and sustainability, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the temporal processing of the human brain, have come forth as a third-generation of neural networks, famed for their energy efficiency, potential for handling real-time driving scenarios and processing temporal information efficiently. However, SNNs have not yet achieved the performance levels of their predecessors in critical AD tasks, partly due to the intricate dynamics of neurons, their non-differentiable spike operations, and the lack of specialised benchmark workloads and datasets, among others. This paper examines the principles, models, learning rules, and recent advancements of SNNs in the AD domain. Neuromorphic hardware, hand in hand with SNNs, shows potential but has challenges in accessibility, cost, integration, and scalability. This examination aims to bridge gaps by providing a comprehensive understanding of SNNs in the AD field. It emphasises the role of SNNs in shaping the future of AD while considering optimisation and sustainability.

AB  - The clip fitting task is a frequently encountered assembly operation in the car industry. It can cause upper limb pain. During task laboratory simulations, upper limb muscular activity and external force were compared for 4 clip fitting methods: with the bare hand, with an unpowered tool commonly used at a company and with unpowered and powered prototype tools. None of the 4 fitting methods studied induced a lower overall workload than the other three. Muscle activity was lower at the dominant limb when using the unpowered tools and at the non-dominant limb with the bare hand or with the powered tool. Fitting clips with the bare hand required a higher external force than fitting with the three tools. Evaluation of physical workload was different depending on whether external force or muscle activity results were considered. Measuring external force only, as recommended in several standards, is insufficient for evaluating physical workload.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration can be used to share workload to form semi-automated production systems. Assembly operations are recognized with high potential to increase productivity by using the best skills of humans and robots in a combination. Components and parts to be assembled need to be structured and presented to the robot in a known location and orientation. The process of presenting parts to the robot for assembly tasks is referred to as parts feeding. Feeding system needs to be adaptable to dynamics of parts’ design, shape, location, and orientation to have flexibility in the production. The traditional automation methods for parts feeding are part-specific mechanical devices e.g. vibratory bowl feeders which are inflexible towards part variations. This comes as a hindrance in getting maximum advantage of the flexibility potential of human-robot collaboration in assembly. The recent years have seen advances in machine vision and has potential for feeding applications. This paper explores the developments in machine-vision for flexible feeding systems for human-robot assembly cells. A specification model is presented to develop a vision-guided flexible feeding system. Various vision-based feeding techniques are discussed and validated through an industrial case study. The results helped to compare the efficiency of each feeding technique for industrial application.

AB  - In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) has been effectively proposed as a tool to support workers in manual procedural tasks in industry, such as assembly and maintenance. It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers’ performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces.

AB  - Concentrated on the production scheduling of complex products that are assembled by multiple and multilevel manufactured parts, this paper studies the flexible job shop scheduling problem with job precedence constraints (FJSSP-JPC). Distinguished from traditional scheduling model that only considers sequential operation precedence constraints defined by process routings, FJSSP-JPC takes additional hierarchical job precedence constraints defined by Bills-of-Materials (BOMs) of final products into account. A mixed integer programming mathematical model is formulated to describe FJSSP-JPC. To represent feasible solutions that satisfy the hybrid precedence constraints, a novel three-vector encoding scheme and a job precedence repair mechanism based on binary tree are elaborated. Subsequently, this paper proposes an efficient evolutionary multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (EMOGWO) to tackle FJSSP-JPC with minimizing the objectives of makespan, maximum machine workload and total machine workload simultaneously. The algorithm involves an improved social hierarchy and a diverse leader strategy to enhance the convergence speed and population diversity separately. Statistical experiments demonstrate that EMOGWO overwhelms other competing algorithms in aspects of cardinality, convergence and diversity metrics on the majority of test instances.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel approach based on affective robotics that can be applied to industrial applications. Considering a human-robot interaction task, we propose to analyze the mental workload of the operator, and subsequently adapt the behavior of the robotic system, introducing assistive technologies. These technologies would prevent the performances deterioration caused by the human stress, helping him/her only when needed and decreasing the user’s mental workload. This represents a general methodology, which can be applied to several industrial applications, leading to increase the overall performances of human-robot interaction exploiting principles of human-centered design. As a case study, we consider a teleoperation task, where virtual fixtures are utilized as an assistive technology. The stress of the operator is monitored in terms of heart rate variability, measured by means of a wearable sensor tied at the operator’s wrist. Experimental validation of the proposed architecture is performed on a group of 15 users that teleoperate an industrial robot for performing a pick and place task.

Image processing in addition to a continuous wavelet transform filtering method were developed and applied to remove major artifacts and trends on raw webcam photoplethysmographic signals. The measurements are performed on human faces. To induce stress, we have employed a computerized and interactive Stroop color word test on a set composed by twelve participants. The electrodermal activity of the participants was recorded and compared to the mental workload curve assessed by merging two parameters derived from the pulse rate variability and photoplethysmographic amplitude fluctuations, which reflect peripheral vasoconstriction changes. The results exhibit strong correlation between the two measurement techniques. This study offers further support for the applicability of mental workload detection by remote and low-cost means, providing an alternative to conventional contact techniques.

AB  - Identifying the temporal changes of mental workload level (MWL) is crucial for enhancing the safety of human-machine (HM) system operations especially when human operators suffer from cognitive overload and inattention. In this paper, we oversampled the EEG data in minority class to dynamically learn a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model based on a dynamical SMOTE (DySMOTE) approach in order to classify the MWL. The proposed approach consists of data sampling and a dynamical selection strategy, in which the probability of each sample being selected to update the weights and thresholds of the MLP is estimated in each epoch to derive an accurate classifier model. The DySMOTE approach was evaluated on the measured EEG data from eight subjects. The results showed that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of several performance metrics including geometric mean (G-mean) and classification accuracy (or correct classification rate) of individual classes of the MWL.

AB  - The ability to continue driving into old age is strongly associated with older adults’ mobility and wellbeing for those that have been dependant on car use for most of their adult lives. The emergence of highly automated vehicles (HAVs) may have the potential to allow older adults to drive longer and safer. In HAVs, when operating in automated mode, drivers can be completely disengaged from driving, but occasionally they may be required to take back the control of the vehicle. The human-machine interfaces in HAVs play an important role in the safe and comfortable usage of HAVs. To date, only limited research has explored how to design age-friendly HMIs in HAVs and evaluate their effectiveness. This study designed three HMI concepts based on older drivers’ requirements, and conducted a driving simulator investigation with 76 drivers (39 older drivers and 37 younger drivers) to evaluate the effect and relative merits of these HMIs on drivers’ takeover performance, workload and attitudes. Results showed that the ‘R + V’ HMI (informing drivers of vehicle status together with providing the reasons for the manual driving takeover request) led to better takeover performance, lower perceived workload and highly positive attitudes, and is the most beneficial and effective HMI. In addition, The ‘V’ HMI (verbally informing the drivers about vehicle status, including automation mode and speed, before the manual driving takeover request) also had a positive effect on drivers’ takeover performance, perceived workload and attitudes. However, the ‘R’ HMI (solely informing drivers about the reasons for takeover as part of the takeover request) affected older and younger drivers differently, and resulted in deteriorations in performance and more risky takeover for both older and younger drivers compared to the baseline HMI. Moreover, significant age difference was observed in the takeover performance and perceived workload. Above all, this research highlights the significance of taking account older drivers’ requirements into the design of HAVs and the importance of collaboration between automated vehicle and cooperative ITS research communities.

AB  - Dynamic Positioning (DP) is a computer-controlled process to automatically keep a floating vessel at a specific position or to follow a pre-defined path (tracking) by using its own propellers and thrusters. The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.

AB  - Interaction between the adaptive behavior of a human pilot and an adaptive flight control system (FCS) usually leads to undesirable adverse effects such as pilot-induced oscillations (PIO). This paper presents an analysis of this interaction in the case of a fast adapting FCS. The analysis shows that, although a pilot will have some nonlinear behavior at the moment when a failure occurs, the fast adapting FCS allows to keep the physical workload low and the pilot behavior remains the same as before the failure. This effectively mitigates the adverse effects seen in the literature.

AB  - The demand for big data storage and processing has become a challenge in today’s industry. To meet the challenge, there is an increasing number of enterprises adopting distributed storage systems. Frequently, in these systems, storage nodes intensively holding hotspot data could become system bottlenecks while storage nodes without hotspot data might result in low utilization of computing resource. This stems from the fact that almost all the typical distributed storage systems only provide data-amount-oriented balancing mechanisms without considering the different access load of data. To eliminate the system bottlenecks and optimize the resource utilization, there is a demand for such distributed storage systems to employ a workload balancing and adaptive resource management framework. In this paper, we propose a framework of workload balancing and resource management for Swift, a widely used and typical distributed storage system on cloud. In this framework, we design workload monitoring and analysis algorithms for discovering overloaded and underloaded nodes in the cluster. To balance the workload among those nodes, Split, Merge and Pair Algorithms are implemented to regulate physical machines while Resource Reallocate Algorithm is designed to regulate virtual machines on cloud. In addition, by leveraging the mature architecture of distributed storage systems, the framework resides in the hosts and operates through API interception. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments to evaluate it. And the experimental results show the framework can achieve its goals.

AB  - Warehouses play a vital role in mitigating variations in supply and demand, and in providing value-added services in a supply chain. However, our observation of supply chain practice reveals that warehousing decisions are not included when developing a distribution plan for the supply chain. This lack of integration has resulted in a substantial variation in workload (42–220%) at our industry partner’s warehouse costing them millions of dollars. To address this real-world challenge, we introduce the warehouse-inventory-transportation problem (WITP) of determining an optimal distribution plan from vendors to customers via one or more warehouses in order to minimize the total distribution cost. We present a nonlinear integer programming model for the WITP considering supply chains with multiple vendors, stores, products, and time-periods, and one warehouse. The model also considers worker congestion at the warehouse that could affect worker productivity. A heuristic based on iterative local search is developed to solve industry-sized problems with up to 500 stores and 1000 products. Our experiments indicate that the distribution plans obtained via the WITP, as compared to a sequential approach, result in a substantial reduction in workload variance at the warehouse, while considerably reducing the total distribution cost. These plans, however, are sensitive to aisle configuration and technology at the warehouse, and the level and productivity of temporary workers.

KW  - Local outlier factor
AB  - The failure of Web applications often affects a large population of customers, and leads to severe economic loss. Anomaly detection is essential for improving the reliability of Web applications. Current approaches model correlations among metrics, and detect anomalies when the correlations are broken. However, dynamic workloads cause the metric correlations to change over time. Moreover, modeling various metric correlations are difficult in complex Web applications. This paper addresses these problems and proposes an online anomaly detection approach for Web applications. We present an incremental clustering algorithm for training workload patterns online, and employ the local outlier factor (LOF) in the recognized workload pattern to detect anomalies. In addition, we locate the anomalous metrics with the Student's t-test method. We evaluated our approach on a testbed running the TPC-W industry-standard benchmark. The experimental results show that our approach is able to (1) capture workload fluctuations accurately, (2) detect typical faults effectively and (3) has advantages over two contemporary ones in accuracy.

AB  - With the emergence of the Internet of things (IoT), embedded systems have now changed its dimensionality and it is applied in various domains such as healthcare, home automation and mainly Industry 4.0. These Embedded IoT devices are mostly battery-driven. It has been analyzed that usage of Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) centered core memory is considered the most significant source of high energy utility in Embedded IoT devices. For achieving the low power consumption in these devices, Non-volatile memory (NVM) devices such as Parameter Random Access Memory (PRAM) and Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random-Access Memory (STT-RAM) are becoming popular among main memory alternatives in embedded IoT devices because of their features such as high thickness, byte addressability, high scalability and low power intake. Additionally, Non-volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) is widely adopted to save the data in the embedded IoT devices. NVM, flash memories have a limited lifetime, so it is mandatory to adopt intelligent optimization in managing the NVRAM-based embedded devices using an intelligent controller while considering the endurance issue. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a powerful, lightweight machine learning-based workload-adaptive write schemes of the NVRAM, which can increase the lifetime and reduce the energy consumption of the processors. The proposed system consists of three phases like Workload Characterization, Intelligent Compression and Memory Allocators. These phases are used for distributing the write-cycles to NVRAM, following the energy-time consumption and number of data bytes. The extensive experimentations are carried out using the IoMT (Internet of Medical things) benchmark in which the different endurance factors such as application delay, energy and write-time factors were evaluated and compared with the different existing algorithms.

AB  - Recently, with the improvement of Cloud systems technologies and the essential advantages they can provide such as availability, scalability, and costs saving; massive domains in the IT industry are directing their business to the Cloud. To fit the computing demands of this trend along with nowadays fluky applications (e.g. social networks, media contents), Cloud systems require rapid resource changes. As a result, the workload management in a virtualized environment becomes a complex task. In this paper we propose a new proactive workload management model for virtualized resources to inspect the workload behavior of the running Virtual Machines, and to assent an appropriate scheduling and resource consolidation schema in order to improve the system efficiency, utilization, and throughput. We have carried out our model by modifying Xen Cloud Platform, then we tested the model performance through different representative benchmarks. The results show that the Proactive model can decrease the average response time remarkably.

AB  - With the ongoing trend towards conditional automation in the automotive industry, it is vital to ensure that drivers are able to resume vehicle control within the given time budget – even when engaging in non-driving related tasks. A driving simulator study was conducted to examine the impact of non-driving related tasks on drivers’ ability to take over vehicle control. The task consisted of reading or proofreading a text (low vs. high visual-cognitive task load) on a tablet which was either handheld or mounted in the vehicle (low vs. high manual task load). Data from 95 participants (mean age 38years, 47 females) were used to examine reaction times and take-over quality in time-critical steering and braking maneuvers. Manual task load was found to prolong reaction times and to deteriorate take-over quality. Surprisingly, drivers needed even longer for the first gaze at the roadway when holding the tablet in their hands. As expected, these effects were stronger in the steering compared to the braking maneuver. Effects of cognitive task load were found to be dependent on the type of driver intervention. While reaction times and take-over quality deteriorated with increasing cognitive load in the steering maneuver, hardly any effects were found in the braking maneuver. A possible explanation for this surprising finding could be that especially drivers who are intensively engaging in non-driving related tasks spontaneously react with braking to defuse the situation and gain more time. It is thus argued that cognitively demanding non-driving related tasks during automated driving do not necessarily lead to deteriorated take-over performance. Depending on situational characteristics like the required reaction or the perceptual complexity of the situation, these might have different effects on the drivers’ ability to take over.

AB  - Rapid advances in sensing and communication technologies connect isolated manufacturing units, which generates large amounts of data. The new trend of mass customization brings a higher level of disturbances and uncertainties to production planning. Traditional manufacturing systems analyze data and schedule orders in a centralized architecture, which is inefficient and unreliable for the overdependence on central controllers and limited communication channels. Internet of things (IoT) and cloud technologies make it possible to build a distributed manufacturing architecture such as the multi-agent system (MAS). Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used to solve scheduling problems in the manufacturing setting. However, it is difficult for scheduling algorithms to process high-dimensional data in a distributed system with heterogeneous manufacturing units. Therefore, this paper presents new cyber-physical integration in smart factories for online scheduling of low-volume-high-mix orders. First, manufacturing units are interconnected with each other through the cyber-physical system (CPS) by IoT technologies. Attributes of machining operations are stored and transmitted by radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Second, we propose an AI scheduler with novel neural networks for each unit (e.g., warehouse, machine) to schedule dynamic operations with real-time sensor data. Each AI scheduler can collaborate with other schedulers by learning from their scheduling experiences. Third, we design new reward functions to improve the decision-making abilities of multiple AI schedulers based on reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated in a smart factory by real-world case studies. Experimental results show that the new architecture for smart factories not only improves the learning and scheduling efficiency of multiple AI schedulers but also effectively deals with unexpected events such as rush orders and machine failures.

AB  - Adaptive cruise control (ACC), a driver assistance system that controls longitudinal motion, has been introduced in consumer cars in 1995. A next milestone is highly automated driving (HAD), a system that automates both longitudinal and lateral motion. We investigated the effects of ACC and HAD on drivers’ workload and situation awareness through a meta-analysis and narrative review of simulator and on-road studies. Based on a total of 32 studies, the unweighted mean self-reported workload was 43.5% for manual driving, 38.6% for ACC driving, and 22.7% for HAD (0%=minimum, 100=maximum on the NASA Task Load Index or Rating Scale Mental Effort). Based on 12 studies, the number of tasks completed on an in-vehicle display relative to manual driving (100%) was 112% for ACC and 261% for HAD. Drivers of a highly automated car, and to a lesser extent ACC drivers, are likely to pick up tasks that are unrelated to driving. Both ACC and HAD can result in improved situation awareness compared to manual driving if drivers are motivated or instructed to detect objects in the environment. However, if drivers are engaged in non-driving tasks, situation awareness deteriorates for ACC and HAD compared to manual driving. The results of this review are consistent with the hypothesis that, from a Human Factors perspective, HAD is markedly different from ACC driving, because the driver of a highly automated car has the possibility, for better or worse, to divert attention to secondary tasks, whereas an ACC driver still has to attend to the roadway.

AB  - Slicing silicon ingot is the first step in manufacturing crystalline silicon, the surface quality of silicon wafer affects the workload and cost of subsequent processes. In this paper, a mathematical model of the inner-diameter slicing is presented to investigate the inherent forming mechanism of wafer surface topography in the inner-diameter slicing process. Dynamic model of the inner-diameter saw blade is systematically and detailly established by mathematical formulas. The cutting temperatures, in-plane membrane stresses, transverse deflection, dynamic characteristics of the inner-diameter saw blade are determined analytically. Effects of cutting parameters on the temperature, the stress and transverse deflection of the inner-diameter saw blade are described, natural frequency and dynamic stability of the inner-diameter saw blade in the slicing process are analyzed. Besides, the influences of cutting factors on the surface of the wafer are discussed. The developed mathematical model is meaningful and beneficial to understand the dynamic characteristics and wafer forming mechanism during the slicing process of the inner-diameter saw blade.
