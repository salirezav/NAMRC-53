TI  - Effort-Reward Imbalance and Work Productivity Among Hotel Housekeeping Employees: 
      A Pilot Study.
PG  - 516-521
LID - 10.1177/2165079918755803 [doi]
AB  - This study explored the relationship between effort-reward imbalance (ERI) at 
      work and work productivity among hotel housekeepers. A community-based approach 
      was used to recruit 23 hotel housekeepers who completed the ERI and Work 
      Performance Questionnaires. Work productivity was determined by combining 
      self-report absenteeism and presenteeism. More than 40% of the participants 
      reported high ERI (ERI >1). Also, 59.1% reported low work productivity. 
      Interestingly, despite the individualized high reports of ERI and low work 
      productivity, correlation analysis showed that high ERI was correlated with high 
      presenteeism and work productivity as a whole. This is the first study to explore 
      work productivity among this worker group. Despite the small sample size and the 
      cross-sectional nature of the study, this study points to the need for 
      organization-based interventions to not only improve employee health but also 
      their work productivity.

TI  - Evaluation of absenteeism and presenteeism status of factory employees.
PG  - 449-457
LID - 10.3233/WOR-230642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While absenteeism refers to not attending work, presenteeism is 
      defined as not being present at work. These two conditions, which negatively 
      affect employee health, can be indicators of work efficiency, work peace, work 
      safety and work engagement. OBJECTIVE: Several factors were evaluated in this 
      study concerning absenteeism and presenteeism among factory workers. METHODS: 
      This cross-sectional study was conducted among workers in a factory operating in 
      a heavy industry in southern Turkey in 2021. A survey consisting of 57 questions 
      was applied to 152 factory workers by face-to-face interview method. The 
      participants' behaviour over the last month was evaluated regarding absenteeism 
      and presenteeism. RESULTS: It was reported that 24 (15.8%) of all employees were 
      absent from work in the last month (absenteeism), excluding holidays and sick 
      leave, and that 20 (13.2%) employees engaged in presenteeism, working when they 
      should not have been at the workplace. There was a high absenteeism rate among 
      employees who had an acute illness and were dissatisfied with their jobs. Several 
      factors have been associated with presenteeism, including poor economic 
      conditions, family health problems, previous unemployment, working overtime, job 
      dissatisfaction, poor relationships with colleagues and difficulty finding a 
      replacement, acute illness, sleep problems and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: To increase 
      the productivity and commitment of employees, it may be useful to identify the 
      reasons for absenteeism and present behaviours, to facilitate effective 
      interpersonal communication skills by examining the organisational climate of 
      employees, and to regulate workload based on a comprehensive assessment of the 
      health status of employees.

TI  - Urinary symptoms and infections among female garment factory workers in 
      Bangladesh.
PG  - 847-856
LID - 10.3233/WOR-203136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of urinary symptoms and infections among female 
      garment factory workers in Bangladesh - a large developing country - is largely 
      unknown. Garment sector is this country's main economic growth engine. 
      OBJECTIVES: This paper focuses on garment industry workers and compares the 
      findings with another group of low socioeconomic status working women. METHODS: 
      Urinary tract symptoms (UTS) were determined by self-reported survey including 
      International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Female Lower 
      Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS) and urinary tract infection (UTI) was 
      determined among a subset population by urine dipstick tests. RESULTS: Data were 
      collected from 310 garment workers and 297 comparison workers. About one third of 
      garment workers (31.94%) and comparison workers (29.97%) could take up to 3 
      toilet breaks in a day. Garment workers reported to be more sexually active and 
      menstruation was more common among them compared to comparison workers. They 
      reported a significantly higher prevalence of malodorous urine and vaginal 
      discharge. Garment workers were found to have a significantly higher ICIQ-FLUTS 
      score of voiding than comparison workers (0.44 vs. 0.27; p-value = 0.0167).Among 
      the study respondents, 148 garment workers and 134 other workers provided urine 
      samples and 21 (7.45%) were found to have UTI. After considering all the risk 
      factors in multivariate model, garment work had a significant impact on the 
      probability of having UTI with Odds Ratio of 5.46 (p-value = 0.0374; 95% 
      CI = 1.10, 26.97) compared to other workers. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights 
      the prevalence and burden of urinary symptoms and infections among female worker 
      populations in Bangladesh.

TI  - Connotations of psychological and physiological health in the psychosocial work 
      environment: An industrial context.
PG  - 551-561
LID - 10.3233/WOR-193016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological conditions are experiences of the conscious and 
      unconscious elements of the work context, which revolve around workers' 
      perceptions of feeling either engaged or disengaged with the assigned tasks. In 
      the psychosocial work environment of hazardous industries like petrochemicals 
      where production lasts twenty-four hours a day and continues seven-days-a-week, a 
      psychologically available worker is extremely important. Psychological 
      availability refers to when workers who are physically, emotionally and 
      psychologically engaged at the moment of performing tasks. OBJECTIVE: The broad 
      objective of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of 
      behavioral factors on the psychological and physiological health of workers. 
      METHODS: The latest, second generation technique, which is structural equation 
      modeling, is used to identify the relationships between behavioral antecedents 
      and health outcomes. A total of 277 technical workers participated, aged between 
      20 and 49 and were healthy in all aspects. RESULTS: The study results showed 
      quantitative demands, emotional demands, work-family conflict, and job insecurity 
      were significantly associated with both psychological (stress) and physiological 
      (Body Mass Index) factors. The social support of colleagues produced mixed 
      findings with direct and indirect paths. Stress also significantly mediates the 
      psychosocial factors and burnout of the workers. CONCLUSION: The study concluded 
      that workers were physically available, but they experienced distractions as 
      members of social systems, affecting their physiological and psychological 
      health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many sewing machine operators are working with high risk factors for 
      musculoskeletal health in the garments industries in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: To 
      identify the physical risk factors among sewing machine operators in a 
      Bangladeshi garments factory. PARTICIPANTS: Sewing machine operators (327, 83% 
      female), were evaluated. The mean age of the participants was 25.25 years. 
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: Six ergonomic risk factors were determined using the 
      Musculoskeletal Disorders risk assessment. Data collection included measurements 
      of sewing machine table and chair heights; this data was combined with 
      information from informal interviews. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Significant 
      ergonomic risk factors found included the combination of awkward postures of the 
      neck and back, repetitive hand and arm movements, poor ergonomic workstations and 
      prolonged working hours without adequate breaks; these risk factors resulted in 
      musculoskeletal complaints, sick leave, and switching jobs. CONCLUSIONS: One 
      aspect of improving worker health in garment factories includes addressing 
      musculoskeletal risk factors through ergonomic interventions.

LID - 10.3233/WOR-131658 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between job stress and job satisfaction by the 
      follow-up study should be more evaluated for workers' health support. OBJECTIVE: 
      Job stress is strongly affected by the content of the job and the personality of 
      a worker. This study was focused on determining the changes of the job stress and 
      job satisfaction levels over a two-year interval, using the Brief Job Stress 
      Questionnaire (BJSQ). METHODS: This self-administered questionnaire was 
      distributed to the same 310 employees of a Japanese industrial company in 2009 
      and 2011. Sixty-one employees were lost from 371 responders in 2009. Data of 16 
      items from 57 items graded on a four-point Likert-type scale to measure the job 
      stressors, psycho-physical complaints and support for workers, job overload (six 
      items), job control (three items), support (six items) and job satisfaction score 
      (one item) were selected for the analysis. RESULTS: The age-adjusted partial 
      correlation coefficients for job overload, job control and support were 0.684 (p< 
      0.001), 0.474 (p< 0.001) and 0.612 (p< 0.001), respectively. The concordance 
      correlation coefficient (and 95% confidence interval indicated within 
      parentheses) for job overload, job control and support were 0.681 (0.616-0.736), 
      0.473 (0.382-0.555), and 0.623 (0.549-0.687), respectively. There were no 
      significant differences in the mean score for job overload, job control or 
      support, although significant decline in the job satisfaction level was apparent 
      at the end of the two-year period (p< 0.05). There was also a significant decline 
      in the job satisfaction in 2009 and in 2011 for subjects with keeping low job 
      strain. CONCLUSIONS: No significant changes in the scores on the three elements 
      of job stress were observed over the two-year study period, and the job 
      satisfaction level deteriorated significantly during this period. There was a 
      decline in the job satisfaction in the two-year period, although subjects did not 
      suffer from job stress at the same period.

TI  - Perceived stress in human-machine interaction in modern manufacturing 
      environments-Results of a qualitative interview study.
PG  - 187-199
LID - 10.1002/smi.2853 [doi]
AB  - Rapid advances in digitization technologies are changing modern working 
      conditions especially in industrial settings. Consequently, employees are 
      confronted with new forms of human-machine interaction. Whether changes in 
      working conditions in general, and the increasing relevance of human-machine 
      interaction in particular, affect psychosocial working conditions, and employee's 
      health is currently matter of debate, but empirical data are lacking. Therefore, 
      we conducted semistructured interviews with 36 employees working in five 
      different companies. The interviews were aimed at identifying potential stressors 
      associated with the introduction and use of modern technologies in the 
      manufacturing industry. The results show that stressors linked to human-machine 
      interaction are technical problems, poor usability, low situation awareness, and 
      increased requirements on employees' qualification. For example, technical 
      problems such as breakdowns or slowdowns were described as a main stressor when 
      employees were not qualified to handle these problems on their own, thus 
      decelerating work flows and causing additional time pressure. Overall, the 
      results show that problems in human-machine interaction, which have been observed 
      in laboratory and nonindustrial settings, also apply to industrial work places 
      with highly automated working conditions and are a potential source of stress. 
      These factors should be considered in psychosocial risk assessment of 
      work-related stressors.

TI  - Practical Judgment of Workload Based on Physical Activity, Work Conditions, and 
      Worker's Age in Construction Site.

AB  - It is important for construction companies to sustain a productive workforce 
      without sacrificing its health and safety. This study aims to develop a practical 
      judgement method to estimate the workload risk of individual construction 
      workers. Based on studies, we developed a workload model comprising a 
      hygrothermal environment, behavioral information, and the physical 
      characteristics of workers). The construction workers' heart rate and physical 
      activity were measured using the data collected from a wearable device equipped 
      with a biosensor and an acceleration sensor. This study is the first report to 
      use worker physical activity, age, and the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) to 
      determine a worker's physical workload. The accuracy of this health risk judgment 
      result was 89.2%, indicating that it is possible to easily judge the health risk 
      of workers even in an environment where it is difficult to measure the subject in 
      advance. The proposed model and its findings can aid in monitoring the health 
      impacts of working conditions during construction activities, and thereby 
      contribute toward determining workers' health damage. However, the sampled 
      construction workers are 12 workers, further studies in other working conditions 
      are required to accumulate more evidence and assure the accuracy of the models.

TI  - Employment experiences of immigrant workers in aged care in regional South 
      Australia.
PG  - 2693
AB  - PURPOSE: The contributions of immigrant workers to the aged care workforce cannot 
      be overemphasised. The report of the National Institute of Labour Studies records 
      a significant number of immigrants in the aged care industry in Australia. The 
      number of overseas-born workers in the residential aged care sector had risen 
      steadily, according to recent workforce statistics. However, the employment 
      positions these immigrant workers fill have perennially been labelled as 
      low-paying and low-status, warranting more research into the plight of immigrant 
      workers, especially those in regional areas. This study investigates the current 
      employment experience of immigrant workers working in aged care in regional South 
      Australia. METHODS: This qualitative study is based on a focus group consisting 
      of seven immigrant workers (five personal carers, one home support worker and one 
      allied health assistant), who shared their individual perceptions of their 
      employment experience. The workers were employed by three aged care facilities 
      run by a community-based not-for-profit organisation governed by one incorporated 
      body. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the focus group data. This article 
      reports on part of the findings of a larger research study where the authors have 
      included the perceptions of co-workers and managers about working with immigrant 
      workers. RESULTS: This study reveals mixed experiences of immigrant workers with 
      employment in aged care. Satisfaction came from positive and encouraging client 
      feedback, enriching work experience, flexible hours and simply having a job. 
      Dissatisfaction came from constraints with time, workload, staffing, poor peer 
      relations, discriminatory practices and the nature of the job itself. Immigrant 
      workers do not experience a strong support infrastructure. Limitations of the 
      study include the small sample size used and the focus on one regional city. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that aged care facility managers and executive 
      officers can enhance positive work experience of immigrant workers by making some 
      workplace reforms.

TI  - A capability perspective on sustainable employability: A Dutch focus group study 
      on organizational, work and personal conversion factors.
PG  - e0274000
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0274000 [doi]
LID - e0274000
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the field of work, there is a shift towards more value-based 
      approaches to study the sustainable employability of the present-day worker. The 
      capability approach offers a value based and innovative conceptualisation and 
      framework of sustainable employability characterized by contextuality, 
      normativity and diversity. The capabilities of Dutch employees have been 
      established and validated, yet it is not known which conversion factors on a 
      personal, work and organizational level enable employees to achieve value in work 
      in different Dutch occupational sectors. METHODS: Our qualitative approach 
      included seven focus groups in different occupational sectors including elderly 
      care, higher education, insurance work, facility management and the oil-, car- 
      and chemical industry. Each focus group included 5-11 participants and took 
      approximately one and a half hour. A qualitative content analysis was used to 
      analyse the data, by combining deductive and inductive coding respectively. 
      Deductive coding involved assigning themes to the conversion of resources into 
      capabilities at the organizational, work and personal level. RESULTS: On the 
      organizational conversion level, important themes were cultural aspects, power 
      relations, shortage of personnel and policies for self-management. On the work 
      conversion level, social contacts, communication and workload, tasks and 
      schedules were identified. Social contacts were described as a work value in 
      itself, but also conditional for achieving other work values. On the personal 
      conversion level, experienced work stress, motivation and the ability to achieve 
      values informally within the company. CONCLUSION: From our findings it follows 
      that focus groups are sensitive to identify conversion factors on all three 
      levels of conversion. In addition, companies and their employees might 
      effectively increase work capabilities by being sensitive to all three conversion 
      levels simultaneously. Further research is necessary to study the effect of a 
      capability-based intervention at the work floor.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Physiological cardiac hypertrophy and dilation are common findings 
      in heavy physical load activity. We carried out this study to investigate the 
      relationship between construction work and cardiac parameters adaptations, by 
      comparing healthy masons to office workers on heart ultrasound. METHODS: The 
      study was carried out on, 50 construction workers and 50 office workers matched 
      for their weight, height and age. Systolic and Diastolic blood pressures, Left 
      Ventricular diameter and thickness, Septum wall thickness and Left ventricular 
      mass index were measured and calculated. RESULTS: Heart rate, systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressures were lower in construction workers, as compared to 
      office workers: respectively 63±7 bpm vs. 75±6 bpm (p = 0.000); 120.1±7 mmHg vs. 
      130.5±9 mmHg (p = 0.000) and 68.5±7 mmHg vs. 77.0 ±9 mmHg (p = 0.000). 
      Construction workers had a thicker septum and posterior wall: respectively 10.3 ± 
      1.1 mm vs. 8.9 ± 0.9 mm (p = 0.000); and 9.0 ± 1.2 mm vs. 8.1 ± 0.8 mm (p = 
      0.000). CONCLUSION: Conclusion We deducted that heavy load work has an impact on 
      the heart mensuration. The past occupational history has to be taken into 
      consideration during initial medical assessing of a worker in for a new job so as 
      to avoid erroneous conclusions.

TI  - The Job Accommodation Scale (JAS): psychometric evaluation of a new measure of 
      employer support for temporary job modifications.
PG  - 755-65
LID - 10.1007/s10926-014-9508-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An employer offer of temporary job modification is a key strategy 
      for facilitating return-to-work for musculoskeletal conditions, but there are no 
      validated scales to assess the level of support for temporary job modifications 
      across a range of job types and organizations. OBJECTIVE: To pilot test a new 
      21-item self-report measure [the Job Accommodation Scale (JAS)] to assess its 
      applicability, internal consistency, factor structure, and relation to physical 
      job demands. METHODS: Supervisors (N = 804, 72.8 % male, mean age = 46) were 
      recruited from 19 employment settings in the USA and Canada and completed a 
      30-min online survey regarding job modification practices. As part of the survey, 
      supervisors nominated and described a job position they supervised and completed 
      the JAS for a hypothetical worker (in that position) with an episode of low back 
      pain. Job characteristics were derived from the occupational informational 
      network job classification database. RESULTS: The full response range (1-4) was 
      utilized on all 21 items, with no ceiling or floor effects. Avoiding awkward 
      postures was the most feasible accommodation and moving the employee to a 
      different site or location was the least feasible. An exploratory factor analysis 
      suggested five underlying factors (Modify physical workload; Modify work 
      environment; Modify work schedule; Find alternate work; and Arrange for 
      assistance), and there was an acceptable goodness-of-fit for the five parceled 
      sub-factor scores as a single latent construct in a measurement model (structural 
      equation model). Job accommodations were less feasible for more physical jobs and 
      for heavier industries. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot administration of the JAS with 
      respect to a hypothetical worker with low back pain showed initial support for 
      its applicability, reliability, and validity when administered to supervisors. 
      Future studies should assess its validity for use in actual disability cases, for 
      a range of health conditions, and to assess different stakeholder opinions about 
      the feasibility of job accommodation strategies.

TI  - The impact of mental health disorders and job demands on the individual job 
      performance of construction workers.
LID - 10.1093/joccuh/uiae060 [doi]
LID - uiae060
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Understanding the impact of job demands and mental health disorders 
      on individual job performance is crucial to achieving a more productive workforce 
      and should be empirically investigated. Therefore, the main purpose of this study 
      was to assess the impact of job demands and mental health disorders on individual 
      job performance among construction workers. In addition, we examined the 
      interaction effect between job demands and some demographic characteristics 
      (income, marital status, experience, and area of residence) on the job 
      performance of construction workers in 2 dimensions. METHODS: For this purpose, a 
      new conceptual model and 3 different hypotheses were introduced. A survey was 
      designed and administered to 513 construction workers. Whereas the measurement 
      items regarding demographic characteristics, job demands, and mental health 
      disorders were addressed to construction workers, the last part related to job 
      performance of construction workers was conducted with site managers of the 
      workers to obtain more objective results. A structural equation modeling approach 
      was adopted to assess the validity of the model and to test the hypotheses. 
      RESULTS: The results of this study show that whereas job demands have a 
      significant and high impact on individual job performance, the effect of mental 
      health disorders on job performance is significant at a moderate level. In 
      addition, the demographic characteristics of marital status and area of residence 
      have a significant interaction effect on job performance when combined with job 
      demands. CONCLUSION: Providing individualized support systems, resources, and 
      opportunities for construction workers can help mitigate the negative effects of 
      excessive demands and mental disorders on labor productivity.

TI  - Predictors of Attitudes Toward Non-Technical Skills in Farming.
PG  - 60-69
LID - 10.1080/1059924X.2017.1384775 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Farming is a high-risk sector with up to 170,000 worldwide fatalities 
      reported per year; it is therefore vital to identify methods of mitigating the 
      dangers of this industry. Research within high-risk industries, such as aviation, 
      shipping, and agriculture, has identified the importance of non-technical skills 
      (NTS) in maintaining effective, safe performance and reducing error and injury. 
      However, there is a lack of research evaluating factors that may contribute to 
      NTS attitudes and behaviors. As a first step to address this literature gap, the 
      current study evaluated a range of individual and environmental factors as 
      potential predictors of attitudes toward NTS in agriculture. METHOD: A sample of 
      170 farmers from within the United Kingdom and Ireland were surveyed using an 
      online questionnaire. The questionnaire included measures of personality, stress, 
      attitudes toward safety (safety climate, motivation, and risk), environmental 
      stressors (workload, work-life imbalance), and non-technical skills (team and 
      lone worker). RESULTS: Attitudes toward safety climate, compliance, and 
      motivation showed a significant association with both team-based and lone worker 
      NTS. Conscientiousness correlated positively with the majority of the NTS 
      elements. Multiple regression analysis indicated neuroticism and 
      conscientiousness demonstrated capacity to predict NTS attitudes. Concerns about 
      costs and equipment, attitudes toward safety climate, and safety motivation were 
      also found to be significant predictors of NTS attitudes. CONCLUSION: The results 
      indicate the utility of individual characteristics and environmental factors when 
      predicting farming NTS attitudes. As a result, these elements could be important 
      when evaluating engagement with NTS and developing NTS training initiatives in 
      agriculture.

TI  - Associations between worker characteristics, workplace factors, and work-related 
      musculoskeletal disorders: a cross-sectional study of male construction workers 
      in Nigeria.
PG  - 447-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the association between worker characteristics, 
      workplace factors, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in 
      Nigeria's construction industry. METHODS: A cross-sectional site-by-site survey 
      was conducted in 5 existing construction companies in Uyo, Nigeria. The subjects 
      (n = 1200 males), aged 18-55 years, filled in the semistructured Nordic 
      musculoskeletal questionnaire and the job content questionnaire on demographics, 
      work and lifestyle characteristics, and workplace risk factors for WMSDs. 
      RESULTS: The overall prevalence of WMSDs was 39.25%. Differences in age, race, 
      weight, body mass index (BMI), education status, and employment status were 
      significantly associated with the prevalence of WMSDs. Prevalence according to 
      trade was as follows: ironworkers highest at 49% and administrative staff lowest 
      at 31%. Ironworkers (55.7%), administrative staff (53.3%), and security staff 
      (38.7%) scored higher on physical, psychosocial, and individual risk factors, 
      respectively. Workplace factors with increased odds for WMSDs were psychological 
      demands and mental workload, age, BMI, low work experience, low education status, 
      awkward movement of head and arms, working against force or vibration, fast work 
      pace, and race. CONCLUSION: The recorded high prevalence was multifactorial in 
      etiology; hence, multi-intervention strategies are required.

      Environments (FRAME) Survey: A Participatory Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16040522 [doi]
LID - 522
AB  - Existing risk assessment tools are not effective or sustainable in identifying 
      Oil and Gas Extraction (OGE) workers at high risk of fatigue-related injuries or 
      incidents. We developed a comprehensive Fatigue Risk Assessment and Management in 
      high-risk Environments (FRAME) survey through an industry-academic participatory 
      approach. The FRAME survey was developed through: (1) systematic gathering of 
      existing fatigue scales; (2) refining the inventory using the Delphi Consensus 
      technique; and (3) further refinement through employee/worker focus groups. The 
      participatory approach resulted in a final FRAME survey across four fatigue 
      dimensions-sleep, shiftwork, physical, and mental fatigue, and was composed of 26 
      items. The FRAME survey was founded on occupational fatigue science and refined 
      and tailored to the OGE industry, through rigorous industry stakeholder input, 
      for safer, effective, practical, and sustainable fatigue assessment and 
      management efforts.

TI  - Job demands, job resources, and job performance in japanese workers: a 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 471-9
AB  - This study investigated the cross-sectional association of job demands (i.e., 
      psychological demands) and job resources (i.e., decision latitude, supervisor 
      support, co-worker support, and extrinsic reward) with job performance. A total 
      of 1,198 workers (458 males and 740 females) from a manufacturing company in 
      Japan completed a self-administered questionnaire that included the Job Content 
      Questionnaire, Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire, World Health Organization 
      Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, and demographic survey. Hierarchical 
      multiple regression analyses were conducted. After adjusting for demographic 
      characteristics, decision latitude (β=0.107, p=0.001) and extrinsic reward 
      (β=0.158, p<0.001) were positively and significantly associated with job 
      performance while supervisor support (β=-0.102, p=0.002) was negatively and 
      significantly associated with job performance. On the other hand, psychological 
      demands or co-worker support was not significantly associated with job 
      performance. These findings suggest that higher decision latitude and extrinsic 
      reward enhance job performance among Japanese employees.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To profile the sick leave landscape in the United States. DATA 
      SOURCES: The 2011 Leave Supplement of the American Time Use Survey. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify (i) employees without sick pay 
      coverage and (ii) employees who attend work sick. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty-five 
      percent of full-time employees have sick pay coverage. Coverage rates are below 
      20 percent for employees with hourly wages below $10, part-time employees, and 
      employees in the hospitality and leisure industry. CONCLUSION: Each week, up to 3 
      million U.S. employees go to work sick. Females, low-income earners, and those 
      aged 25 to 34 years have a significantly elevated risk of presenteeism behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a group of musculoskeletal 
      disorders that comprise one of the most common disorders related to occupational 
      sick leave worldwide. Musculoskeletal disorders accounted for 21% to 28% of work 
      absenteeism days in 2017/2018 in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. There are 
      several interventions that may be effective in tackling the high prevalence of 
      work-related musculoskeletal disorders among workers, such as physical, cognitive 
      and organisational interventions. In this review, we will focus on work breaks as 
      a measure of primary prevention, which are a type of organisational intervention. 
      OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of different work-break schedules for 
      preventing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in healthy 
      workers, when compared to conventional or alternate work-break schedules. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical 
      Trials Registry Platform, to April/May 2019. In addition, we searched references 
      of the included studies and of relevant literature reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of work-break interventions for 
      preventing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among workers. The 
      studies were eligible for inclusion when intervening on work-break frequency, 
      duration and/or type, compared to conventional or an alternate work-break 
      intervention. We included only those studies in which the investigated population 
      included healthy, adult workers, who were free of musculoskeletal complaints 
      during study enrolment, without restrictions to sex or occupation. The primary 
      outcomes were newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders, self-reported 
      musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, and productivity or work 
      performance. We considered workload changes as secondary outcomes. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, 
      abstracts and full texts for study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk 
      of bias. We contacted authors for additional study data where required. We 
      performed meta-analyses, where possible, and we assessed the overall quality of 
      the evidence for each outcome of each comparison using the five GRADE 
      considerations. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies (373 workers), four 
      parallel RCTs, one cross-over RCT, and one combined parallel plus cross-over RCT. 
      At least 295 of the employees were female and at least 39 male; for the remaining 
      39 employees, the sex was not specified in the study trial. The studies 
      investigated different work-break frequencies (five studies) and different 
      work-break types (two studies). None of the studies investigated different 
      work-break durations. We judged all studies to have a high risk of bias. The 
      quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of self-reported musculoskeletal 
      pain, discomfort and fatigue was low; the quality of the evidence for the primary 
      outcomes of productivity and work performance was very low. The studies were 
      executed in Europe or Northern America, with none from low- to middle-income 
      countries. One study could not be included in the data analyses, because no 
      detailed results have been reported.Changes in the frequency of work breaksThere 
      is low-quality evidence that additional work breaks may not have a considerable 
      effect on musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared with no 
      additional work breaks (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.08; 95% CI -0.35 to 
      0.18; three studies; 225 participants). Additional breaks may not have a positive 
      effect on productivity or work performance, when compared with no additional work 
      breaks (SMD -0.07; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.19; three studies; 225 participants; very 
      low-quality evidence).We found low-quality evidence that additional work breaks 
      may not have a considerable effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, 
      discomfort or fatigue (MD 1.80 on a 100-mm VAS scale; 95% CI -41.07 to 64.37; one 
      study; 15 participants), when compared to work breaks as needed (i.e. microbreaks 
      taken at own discretion). There is very low-quality evidence that additional work 
      breaks may have a positive effect on productivity or work performance, when 
      compared to work breaks as needed (MD 542.5 number of words typed per 3-hour 
      recording session; 95% CI 177.22 to 907.78; one study; 15 
      participants).Additional higher frequency work breaks may not have a considerable 
      effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue (MD 
      11.65 on a 100-mm VAS scale; 95% CI -41.07 to 64.37; one study; 10 participants; 
      low-quality evidence), when compared to additional lower frequency work breaks. 
      We found very low-quality evidence that additional higher frequency work breaks 
      may not have a considerable effect on productivity or work performance (MD -83.00 
      number of words typed per 3-hour recording session; 95% CI -305.27 to 139.27; one 
      study; 10 participants), when compared to additional lower frequency work 
      breaks.Changes in the duration of work breaksNo trials were identified that 
      assessed the effect of different durations of work breaks.Changes in the type of 
      work breakWe found low-quality evidence that active breaks may not have a 
      considerable positive effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, 
      discomfort and fatigue (MD -0.17 on a 1-7 NRS scale; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.37; one 
      study; 153 participants), when compared to passive work breaks.Relaxation work 
      breaks may not have a considerable effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal 
      pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared to physical work breaks (MD 0.20 on a 
      1-7 NRS scale; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.82; one study; 97 participants; low-quality 
      evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-quality evidence that different 
      work-break frequencies may have no effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal 
      pain, discomfort and fatigue. For productivity and work performance, evidence was 
      of very low-quality that different work-break frequencies may have a positive 
      effect. For different types of break, there may be no effect on 
      participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue according to 
      low-quality evidence. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the 
      effectiveness of frequency, duration and type of work-break interventions among 
      workers, if possible, with much higher sample sizes than the studies included in 
      the current review. Furthermore, work-break interventions should be reconsidered, 
      taking into account worker populations other than office workers, and taking into 
      account the possibility of combining work-break intervention with other 
      interventions such as ergonomic training or counselling, which may may possibly 
      have an effect on musculoskeletal outcomes and work performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: High levels of occupational physical activity (OPA) increase heart 
      rate, blood pressure (BP) and the risk of hypertension. Older workers may be more 
      vulnerable to high levels of OPA due to age-related degeneration of the 
      cardiovascular system and cardiorespiratory fitness. This study investigates the 
      association of relative aerobic workload (RAW) with resting BP and examines if 
      this relation is moderated by age. DESIGN: Cross-sectional epidemiological study. 
      SETTING: Data were collected among employees of 15 Danish companies in the 
      cleaning, manufacturing and transport sectors. PARTICIPANTS: 2107 employees were 
      invited for participation, of these 1087 accepted and 562 (42% female and 4% 
      non-Westerns) were included in the analysis based on the criteria of being 
      non-pregnant, no allergy to bandages, sufficient amount of heart rate data 
      corresponding to ≥4 work hours per workday or 75% of average work hours, and no 
      missing outcome and confounder values. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      The primary outcome measure was BP. RESULTS: Heart rate reserve was estimated 
      from ambulatory 24-hour heart rate measures covering 2.5 workdays per participant 
      (SD 1.0 day). Age significantly moderated the association between RAW and BP. 
      Mean intensity and duration of high RAW (≥30% heart rate reserve) showed positive 
      associations with diastolic BP and negative associations with pulse pressure (PP) 
      among participants ≥47 years old. Tendencies towards negative associations 
      between RAW and BP were seen among participants <47 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Mean 
      intensity and duration of RAW increased diastolic BP among participants ≥47 years 
      old. Negative associations with PP may be due to healthy worker selection bias. 
      Prevention of hypertension should consider reductions in RAW for ageing workers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As detailed associations between personality and long work hours are 
      unclear, we assessed associations between personality dimensions and overtime 
      work among Japanese white-collar workers. METHODS: From records of hours worked 
      over 12 months by 267 office workers in an organization within the service 
      industry, average overtime work hours per month and occurrence of excessive 
      overtime was determined for each worker. Excessive overtime was defined as >  45 
      overtime work hours per month for at least one month. Responses to a 
      questionnaire assessing socio-demographic and workplace-related factors and the 
      Big Five personality test were analyzed. Associations between personality factors 
      and overtime work were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. 
      RESULTS: Low Extraversion was associated with excessive overtime work (OR 2.02, 
      95%CI 1.02 - 4.02, P =  0.04). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that workers with low 
      Extraversion can't share work when busy to avoid excessive overtime. Personality 
      factors should be considered in studies evaluating work time. Moreover, 
      strengthening communication among workers with low Extraversion may reduce 
      excessive overtime work and associated health problems.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of 
      musculoskeletal disorder symptoms and its risk factors among women rebar workers. 
      A simple random sampling method was used and data were collected by face-to-face 
      interview and ergonomic assessment from February to March 2011. A total of 272 
      women rebar workers with at least 6 months' job experience participated in this 
      study. The findings revealed that 57.7% of workers reported musculoskeletal 
      disorder symptoms with low back and shoulders as the most common body parts 
      affected (46.0%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated 2 variables 
      that are significantly associated with musculoskeletal disorders: prolonged 
      working hours (adjusted odds ratio = 7.63; 95% confidence interval = 2.06-28.31) 
      and awkward posture (adjusted odds ratio = 43.79; 95% confidence interval = 
      17.09-112.20). The high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among women rebar 
      workers suggests that an appropriate ergonomic workstation design and ergonomic 
      training for women rebar workers are necessary.

      truck drivers nationwide participated in this questionnaire-based cross-sectional 
      study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. 
      RESULTS: 43.1% of drivers reported MS pain in at least one body area over the 
      past 12 months and 26.8% over the past 7 days. Bulk drivers had a significantly 
      higher prevalence of MS pain than P&D drivers for both periods. When P&D and Bulk 
      drivers were pooled together, belonging to the Bulk subgroup emerged as the 
      strongest factor for low back pain (OR = 8.45, p = 0.002), for shoulder pain 
      (OR = 3.70, p = 0.027) and for MS pain in any body area (OR = 4.05, p = 0.006). 
      In Bulk drivers "High effort-reward imbalance" was strongly associated with MS 
      pain in any body area (OR = 6.47, p = 0.01), with shoulder pain (OR = 4.95, 
      p = 0.016), and with low back pain (OR = 4.51, p = 0.02). In P&D drivers MS pain 
      in any body area was strongly associated with "Working with hands above 
      shoulders" (OR = 6.58, p = 0.009) and "Whole-body vibration" (OR = 5.48, 
      p = 0.018), while shoulder pain was strongly associated with "Hand-arm vibration" 
      (OR = 7.27, p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of MS pain was higher among 
      industrial gas delivery truck drivers than in the general Quebec male worker 
      population, and higher for Bulk drivers compared to P&D drivers. MS pain in Bulk 
      drivers was mainly associated with psychosocial risk factors and lifestyle; MS 
      pain in P&D drivers was mainly associated with physical risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Piece rate pay remains a common form of compensation in 
      developing-world industries. While the piece rate may boost productivity, it has 
      been shown to have unintended consequences for occupational safety and health, 
      including increased accident and injury risk. OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the 
      relationship between worker pay and physical and emotional health, and questions 
      the modern day business case for piece rate pay in the developing world. METHODS: 
      The relationship between piece rate and self-reported measures of physical and 
      emotional health is estimated using a large survey of garment workers in 109 
      Vietnamese factories between 2010 and 2014. A random effects logit model controls 
      for factory and year, predicting worker health as a function of pay type, 
      demographics, and factory characteristics. FINDINGS: Workers paid by the piece 
      report worse physical and emotional health than workers paid by the hour (OR = 
      1.38-1.81). Wage incentives provide the most consistently significant evidence of 
      all demographic and factory-level variables, including the factory's own 
      performance on occupational safety and health compliance measures. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results highlight the importance of how workers are paid to understanding 
      the variability in worker health outcomes. More research is needed to better 
      understand the business case supporting the continued use of piece rate pay in 
      the developing world.

TI  - Good job, bad job: Occupational perceptions among Latino poultry workers.
PG  - 877-86
LID - 10.1002/ajim.22599 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Immigrant workers frequently take jobs that are physically demanding, 
      provide low wages, and result in injuries (e.g., poultry production and 
      processing). Through a qualitative approach, this paper elicits poultry workers' 
      evaluations of their jobs and set them in the larger context of their lives. 
      METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 poultry workers in 
      western North Carolina. Workers were asked to discuss job characteristics, 
      physical and psychological impacts of their employment, and perceived health 
      risks. RESULTS: Immigrant workers valued the stability, benefits, upward 
      mobility, and pay offered. They disliked the physical demands, the potential 
      perceived effects of the job on their health, and the interactions with bosses 
      and peers. CONCLUSIONS: Workers' willingness to endure dirty, dangerous, and 
      demanding (3-D) conditions of poultry must be understood in the context of other 
      employment options, structural violence, and their focus on immediate family 
      needs that positive aspects of these jobs can fulfill. Am. J. Ind. Med.
