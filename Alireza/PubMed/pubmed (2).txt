Effort-Reward Imbalance and Work Productivity Among Hotel Housekeeping 
Employees: A Pilot Study.

This study explored the relationship between effort-reward imbalance (ERI) at 
work and work productivity among hotel housekeepers. A community-based approach 
was used to recruit 23 hotel housekeepers who completed the ERI and Work 
Performance Questionnaires. Work productivity was determined by combining 
self-report absenteeism and presenteeism. More than 40% of the participants 
reported high ERI (ERI >1). Also, 59.1% reported low work productivity. 
Interestingly, despite the individualized high reports of ERI and low work 
productivity, correlation analysis showed that high ERI was correlated with high 
presenteeism and work productivity as a whole. This is the first study to 
explore work productivity among this worker group. Despite the small sample size 
and the cross-sectional nature of the study, this study points to the need for 
organization-based interventions to not only improve employee health but also 
their work productivity.

BACKGROUND: While absenteeism refers to not attending work, presenteeism is 
defined as not being present at work. These two conditions, which negatively 
affect employee health, can be indicators of work efficiency, work peace, work 
safety and work engagement.
OBJECTIVE: Several factors were evaluated in this study concerning absenteeism 
and presenteeism among factory workers.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among workers in a factory 
operating in a heavy industry in southern Turkey in 2021. A survey consisting of 
57 questions was applied to 152 factory workers by face-to-face interview 
method. The participants' behaviour over the last month was evaluated regarding 
absenteeism and presenteeism.
RESULTS: It was reported that 24 (15.8%) of all employees were absent from work 
in the last month (absenteeism), excluding holidays and sick leave, and that 20 
(13.2%) employees engaged in presenteeism, working when they should not have 
been at the workplace. There was a high absenteeism rate among employees who had 
an acute illness and were dissatisfied with their jobs. Several factors have 
been associated with presenteeism, including poor economic conditions, family 
health problems, previous unemployment, working overtime, job dissatisfaction, 
poor relationships with colleagues and difficulty finding a replacement, acute 
illness, sleep problems and fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: To increase the productivity and commitment of employees, it may be 
useful to identify the reasons for absenteeism and present behaviours, to 
facilitate effective interpersonal communication skills by examining the 
organisational climate of employees, and to regulate workload based on a 
comprehensive assessment of the health status of employees.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of urinary symptoms and infections among female 
garment factory workers in Bangladesh - a large developing country - is largely 
unknown. Garment sector is this country's main economic growth engine.
OBJECTIVES: This paper focuses on garment industry workers and compares the 
findings with another group of low socioeconomic status working women.
METHODS: Urinary tract symptoms (UTS) were determined by self-reported survey 
including International Consultation on Incontinence Modular 
Questionnaire-Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS) and urinary tract 
infection (UTI) was determined among a subset population by urine dipstick 
tests.
RESULTS: Data were collected from 310 garment workers and 297 comparison 
workers. About one third of garment workers (31.94%) and comparison workers 
(29.97%) could take up to 3 toilet breaks in a day. Garment workers reported to 
be more sexually active and menstruation was more common among them compared to 
comparison workers. They reported a significantly higher prevalence of 
malodorous urine and vaginal discharge. Garment workers were found to have a 
significantly higher ICIQ-FLUTS score of voiding than comparison workers (0.44 
vs. 0.27; p-value = 0.0167).Among the study respondents, 148 garment workers and 
134 other workers provided urine samples and 21 (7.45%) were found to have UTI. 
After considering all the risk factors in multivariate model, garment work had a 
significant impact on the probability of having UTI with Odds Ratio of 5.46 
(p-value = 0.0374; 95% CI = 1.10, 26.97) compared to other workers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prevalence and burden of urinary symptoms 
and infections among female worker populations in Bangladesh.

BACKGROUND: Psychological conditions are experiences of the conscious and 
unconscious elements of the work context, which revolve around workers' 
perceptions of feeling either engaged or disengaged with the assigned tasks. In 
the psychosocial work environment of hazardous industries like petrochemicals 
where production lasts twenty-four hours a day and continues seven-days-a-week, 
a psychologically available worker is extremely important. Psychological 
availability refers to when workers who are physically, emotionally and 
psychologically engaged at the moment of performing tasks.
OBJECTIVE: The broad objective of this study was to investigate the direct and 
indirect effects of behavioral factors on the psychological and physiological 
health of workers.
METHODS: The latest, second generation technique, which is structural equation 
modeling, is used to identify the relationships between behavioral antecedents 
and health outcomes. A total of 277 technical workers participated, aged between 
20 and 49 and were healthy in all aspects.
RESULTS: The study results showed quantitative demands, emotional demands, 
work-family conflict, and job insecurity were significantly associated with both 
psychological (stress) and physiological (Body Mass Index) factors. The social 
support of colleagues produced mixed findings with direct and indirect paths. 
Stress also significantly mediates the psychosocial factors and burnout of the 
workers.
CONCLUSION: The study concluded that workers were physically available, but they 
experienced distractions as members of social systems, affecting their 
physiological and psychological health.

BACKGROUND: Many sewing machine operators are working with high risk factors for 
musculoskeletal health in the garments industries in Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the physical risk factors among sewing machine operators 
in a Bangladeshi garments factory.
PARTICIPANTS: Sewing machine operators (327, 83% female), were evaluated. The 
mean age of the participants was 25.25 years.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Six ergonomic risk factors were determined using the 
Musculoskeletal Disorders risk assessment. Data collection included measurements 
of sewing machine table and chair heights; this data was combined with 
information from informal interviews.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Significant ergonomic risk factors found included the 
combination of awkward postures of the neck and back, repetitive hand and arm 
movements, poor ergonomic workstations and prolonged working hours without 
adequate breaks; these risk factors resulted in musculoskeletal complaints, sick 
leave, and switching jobs.
CONCLUSIONS: One aspect of improving worker health in garment factories includes 
addressing musculoskeletal risk factors through ergonomic interventions.

Author information:
(1)Department of Hygiene and Public Health, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between job stress and job satisfaction by the 
follow-up study should be more evaluated for workers' health support.
OBJECTIVE: Job stress is strongly affected by the content of the job and the 
personality of a worker. This study was focused on determining the changes of 
the job stress and job satisfaction levels over a two-year interval, using the 
Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ).
METHODS: This self-administered questionnaire was distributed to the same 310 
employees of a Japanese industrial company in 2009 and 2011. Sixty-one employees 
were lost from 371 responders in 2009. Data of 16 items from 57 items graded on 
a four-point Likert-type scale to measure the job stressors, psycho-physical 
complaints and support for workers, job overload (six items), job control (three 
items), support (six items) and job satisfaction score (one item) were selected 
for the analysis.
RESULTS: The age-adjusted partial correlation coefficients for job overload, job 
control and support were 0.684 (p< 0.001), 0.474 (p< 0.001) and 0.612 (p< 
0.001), respectively. The concordance correlation coefficient (and 95% 
confidence interval indicated within parentheses) for job overload, job control 
and support were 0.681 (0.616-0.736), 0.473 (0.382-0.555), and 0.623 
(0.549-0.687), respectively. There were no significant differences in the mean 
score for job overload, job control or support, although significant decline in 
the job satisfaction level was apparent at the end of the two-year period (p< 
0.05). There was also a significant decline in the job satisfaction in 2009 and 
in 2011 for subjects with keeping low job strain.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant changes in the scores on the three elements of job 
stress were observed over the two-year study period, and the job satisfaction 
level deteriorated significantly during this period. There was a decline in the 
job satisfaction in the two-year period, although subjects did not suffer from 
job stress at the same period.

Rapid advances in digitization technologies are changing modern working 
conditions especially in industrial settings. Consequently, employees are 
confronted with new forms of human-machine interaction. Whether changes in 
working conditions in general, and the increasing relevance of human-machine 
interaction in particular, affect psychosocial working conditions, and 
employee's health is currently matter of debate, but empirical data are lacking. 
Therefore, we conducted semistructured interviews with 36 employees working in 
five different companies. The interviews were aimed at identifying potential 
stressors associated with the introduction and use of modern technologies in the 
manufacturing industry. The results show that stressors linked to human-machine 
interaction are technical problems, poor usability, low situation awareness, and 
increased requirements on employees' qualification. For example, technical 
problems such as breakdowns or slowdowns were described as a main stressor when 
employees were not qualified to handle these problems on their own, thus 
decelerating work flows and causing additional time pressure. Overall, the 
results show that problems in human-machine interaction, which have been 
observed in laboratory and nonindustrial settings, also apply to industrial work 
places with highly automated working conditions and are a potential source of 
stress. These factors should be considered in psychosocial risk assessment of 
work-related stressors.

It is important for construction companies to sustain a productive workforce 
without sacrificing its health and safety. This study aims to develop a 
practical judgement method to estimate the workload risk of individual 
construction workers. Based on studies, we developed a workload model comprising 
a hygrothermal environment, behavioral information, and the physical 
characteristics of workers). The construction workers' heart rate and physical 
activity were measured using the data collected from a wearable device equipped 
with a biosensor and an acceleration sensor. This study is the first report to 
use worker physical activity, age, and the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) to 
determine a worker's physical workload. The accuracy of this health risk 
judgment result was 89.2%, indicating that it is possible to easily judge the 
health risk of workers even in an environment where it is difficult to measure 
the subject in advance. The proposed model and its findings can aid in 
monitoring the health impacts of working conditions during construction 
activities, and thereby contribute toward determining workers' health damage. 
However, the sampled construction workers are 12 workers, further studies in 
other working conditions are required to accumulate more evidence and assure the 
accuracy of the models.

Australia, Australia. joy.penman@unisa.edu.au.

PURPOSE: The contributions of immigrant workers to the aged care workforce 
cannot be overemphasised. The report of the National Institute of Labour Studies 
records a significant number of immigrants in the aged care industry in 
Australia. The number of overseas-born workers in the residential aged care 
sector had risen steadily, according to recent workforce statistics. However, 
the employment positions these immigrant workers fill have perennially been 
labelled as low-paying and low-status, warranting more research into the plight 
of immigrant workers, especially those in regional areas. This study 
investigates the current employment experience of immigrant workers working in 
aged care in regional South Australia.
METHODS: This qualitative study is based on a focus group consisting of seven 
immigrant workers (five personal carers, one home support worker and one allied 
health assistant), who shared their individual perceptions of their employment 
experience. The workers were employed by three aged care facilities run by a 
community-based not-for-profit organisation governed by one incorporated body. 
Thematic analysis was used to analyse the focus group data. This article reports 
on part of the findings of a larger research study where the authors have 
included the perceptions of co-workers and managers about working with immigrant 
workers.
RESULTS: This study reveals mixed experiences of immigrant workers with 
employment in aged care. Satisfaction came from positive and encouraging client 
feedback, enriching work experience, flexible hours and simply having a job. 
Dissatisfaction came from constraints with time, workload, staffing, poor peer 
relations, discriminatory practices and the nature of the job itself. Immigrant 
workers do not experience a strong support infrastructure. Limitations of the 
study include the small sample size used and the focus on one regional city.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that aged care facility managers and executive 
officers can enhance positive work experience of immigrant workers by making 
some workplace reforms.

OBJECTIVE: In the field of work, there is a shift towards more value-based 
approaches to study the sustainable employability of the present-day worker. The 
capability approach offers a value based and innovative conceptualisation and 
framework of sustainable employability characterized by contextuality, 
normativity and diversity. The capabilities of Dutch employees have been 
established and validated, yet it is not known which conversion factors on a 
personal, work and organizational level enable employees to achieve value in 
work in different Dutch occupational sectors.
METHODS: Our qualitative approach included seven focus groups in different 
occupational sectors including elderly care, higher education, insurance work, 
facility management and the oil-, car- and chemical industry. Each focus group 
included 5-11 participants and took approximately one and a half hour. A 
qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data, by combining 
deductive and inductive coding respectively. Deductive coding involved assigning 
themes to the conversion of resources into capabilities at the organizational, 
work and personal level.
RESULTS: On the organizational conversion level, important themes were cultural 
aspects, power relations, shortage of personnel and policies for 
self-management. On the work conversion level, social contacts, communication 
and workload, tasks and schedules were identified. Social contacts were 
described as a work value in itself, but also conditional for achieving other 
work values. On the personal conversion level, experienced work stress, 
motivation and the ability to achieve values informally within the company.
CONCLUSION: From our findings it follows that focus groups are sensitive to 
identify conversion factors on all three levels of conversion. In addition, 
companies and their employees might effectively increase work capabilities by 
being sensitive to all three conversion levels simultaneously. Further research 
is necessary to study the effect of a capability-based intervention at the work 
floor.

INTRODUCTION: Physiological cardiac hypertrophy and dilation are common findings 
in heavy physical load activity. We carried out this study to investigate the 
relationship between construction work and cardiac parameters adaptations, by 
comparing healthy masons to office workers on heart ultrasound.
METHODS: The study was carried out on, 50 construction workers and 50 office 
workers matched for their weight, height and age. Systolic and Diastolic blood 
pressures, Left Ventricular diameter and thickness, Septum wall thickness and 
Left ventricular mass index were measured and calculated.
RESULTS: Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower in 
construction workers, as compared to office workers: respectively 63±7 bpm vs. 
75±6 bpm (p = 0.000); 120.1±7 mmHg vs. 130.5±9 mmHg (p = 0.000) and 68.5±7 mmHg 
vs. 77.0 ±9 mmHg (p = 0.000). Construction workers had a thicker septum and 
posterior wall: respectively 10.3 ± 1.1 mm vs. 8.9 ± 0.9 mm (p = 0.000); and 9.0 
± 1.2 mm vs. 8.1 ± 0.8 mm (p = 0.000).
CONCLUSION: Conclusion We deducted that heavy load work has an impact on the 
heart mensuration. The past occupational history has to be taken into 
consideration during initial medical assessing of a worker in for a new job so 
as to avoid erroneous conclusions.

INTRODUCTION: An employer offer of temporary job modification is a key strategy 
for facilitating return-to-work for musculoskeletal conditions, but there are no 
validated scales to assess the level of support for temporary job modifications 
across a range of job types and organizations.
OBJECTIVE: To pilot test a new 21-item self-report measure [the Job 
Accommodation Scale (JAS)] to assess its applicability, internal consistency, 
factor structure, and relation to physical job demands.
METHODS: Supervisors (N = 804, 72.8 % male, mean age = 46) were recruited from 
19 employment settings in the USA and Canada and completed a 30-min online 
survey regarding job modification practices. As part of the survey, supervisors 
nominated and described a job position they supervised and completed the JAS for 
a hypothetical worker (in that position) with an episode of low back pain. Job 
characteristics were derived from the occupational informational network job 
classification database.
RESULTS: The full response range (1-4) was utilized on all 21 items, with no 
ceiling or floor effects. Avoiding awkward postures was the most feasible 
accommodation and moving the employee to a different site or location was the 
least feasible. An exploratory factor analysis suggested five underlying factors 
(Modify physical workload; Modify work environment; Modify work schedule; Find 
alternate work; and Arrange for assistance), and there was an acceptable 
goodness-of-fit for the five parceled sub-factor scores as a single latent 
construct in a measurement model (structural equation model). Job accommodations 
were less feasible for more physical jobs and for heavier industries.
CONCLUSIONS: The pilot administration of the JAS with respect to a hypothetical 
worker with low back pain showed initial support for its applicability, 
reliability, and validity when administered to supervisors. Future studies 
should assess its validity for use in actual disability cases, for a range of 
health conditions, and to assess different stakeholder opinions about the 
feasibility of job accommodation strategies.

OBJECTIVES: Understanding the impact of job demands and mental health disorders 
on individual job performance is crucial to achieving a more productive 
workforce and should be empirically investigated. Therefore, the main purpose of 
this study was to assess the impact of job demands and mental health disorders 
on individual job performance among construction workers. In addition, we 
examined the interaction effect between job demands and some demographic 
characteristics (income, marital status, experience, and area of residence) on 
the job performance of construction workers in 2 dimensions.
METHODS: For this purpose, a new conceptual model and 3 different hypotheses 
were introduced. A survey was designed and administered to 513 construction 
workers. Whereas the measurement items regarding demographic characteristics, 
job demands, and mental health disorders were addressed to construction workers, 
the last part related to job performance of construction workers was conducted 
with site managers of the workers to obtain more objective results. A structural 
equation modeling approach was adopted to assess the validity of the model and 
to test the hypotheses.
RESULTS: The results of this study show that whereas job demands have a 
significant and high impact on individual job performance, the effect of mental 
health disorders on job performance is significant at a moderate level. In 
addition, the demographic characteristics of marital status and area of 
residence have a significant interaction effect on job performance when combined 
with job demands.
CONCLUSION: Providing individualized support systems, resources, and 
opportunities for construction workers can help mitigate the negative effects of 
excessive demands and mental disorders on labor productivity.

OBJECTIVES: Farming is a high-risk sector with up to 170,000 worldwide 
fatalities reported per year; it is therefore vital to identify methods of 
mitigating the dangers of this industry. Research within high-risk industries, 
such as aviation, shipping, and agriculture, has identified the importance of 
non-technical skills (NTS) in maintaining effective, safe performance and 
reducing error and injury. However, there is a lack of research evaluating 
factors that may contribute to NTS attitudes and behaviors. As a first step to 
address this literature gap, the current study evaluated a range of individual 
and environmental factors as potential predictors of attitudes toward NTS in 
agriculture.
METHOD: A sample of 170 farmers from within the United Kingdom and Ireland were 
surveyed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included measures of 
personality, stress, attitudes toward safety (safety climate, motivation, and 
risk), environmental stressors (workload, work-life imbalance), and 
non-technical skills (team and lone worker).
RESULTS: Attitudes toward safety climate, compliance, and motivation showed a 
significant association with both team-based and lone worker NTS. 
Conscientiousness correlated positively with the majority of the NTS elements. 
Multiple regression analysis indicated neuroticism and conscientiousness 
demonstrated capacity to predict NTS attitudes. Concerns about costs and 
equipment, attitudes toward safety climate, and safety motivation were also 
found to be significant predictors of NTS attitudes.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate the utility of individual characteristics and 
environmental factors when predicting farming NTS attitudes. As a result, these 
elements could be important when evaluating engagement with NTS and developing 
NTS training initiatives in agriculture.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the association between worker characteristics, 
workplace factors, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in 
Nigeria's construction industry.
METHODS: A cross-sectional site-by-site survey was conducted in 5 existing 
construction companies in Uyo, Nigeria. The subjects (n = 1200 males), aged 
18-55 years, filled in the semistructured Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire 
and the job content questionnaire on demographics, work and lifestyle 
characteristics, and workplace risk factors for WMSDs.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of WMSDs was 39.25%. Differences in age, race, 
weight, body mass index (BMI), education status, and employment status were 
significantly associated with the prevalence of WMSDs. Prevalence according to 
trade was as follows: ironworkers highest at 49% and administrative staff lowest 
at 31%. Ironworkers (55.7%), administrative staff (53.3%), and security staff 
(38.7%) scored higher on physical, psychosocial, and individual risk factors, 
respectively. Workplace factors with increased odds for WMSDs were psychological 
demands and mental workload, age, BMI, low work experience, low education 
status, awkward movement of head and arms, working against force or vibration, 
fast work pace, and race.
CONCLUSION: The recorded high prevalence was multifactorial in etiology; hence, 
multi-intervention strategies are required.

Existing risk assessment tools are not effective or sustainable in identifying 
Oil and Gas Extraction (OGE) workers at high risk of fatigue-related injuries or 
incidents. We developed a comprehensive Fatigue Risk Assessment and Management 
in high-risk Environments (FRAME) survey through an industry-academic 
participatory approach. The FRAME survey was developed through: (1) systematic 
gathering of existing fatigue scales; (2) refining the inventory using the 
Delphi Consensus technique; and (3) further refinement through employee/worker 
focus groups. The participatory approach resulted in a final FRAME survey across 
four fatigue dimensions-sleep, shiftwork, physical, and mental fatigue, and was 
composed of 26 items. The FRAME survey was founded on occupational fatigue 
science and refined and tailored to the OGE industry, through rigorous industry 
stakeholder input, for safer, effective, practical, and sustainable fatigue 
assessment and management efforts.

Science, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan.

This study investigated the cross-sectional association of job demands (i.e., 
psychological demands) and job resources (i.e., decision latitude, supervisor 
support, co-worker support, and extrinsic reward) with job performance. A total 
of 1,198 workers (458 males and 740 females) from a manufacturing company in 
Japan completed a self-administered questionnaire that included the Job Content 
Questionnaire, Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire, World Health Organization 
Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, and demographic survey. Hierarchical 
multiple regression analyses were conducted. After adjusting for demographic 
characteristics, decision latitude (β=0.107, p=0.001) and extrinsic reward 
(β=0.158, p<0.001) were positively and significantly associated with job 
performance while supervisor support (β=-0.102, p=0.002) was negatively and 
significantly associated with job performance. On the other hand, psychological 
demands or co-worker support was not significantly associated with job 
performance. These findings suggest that higher decision latitude and extrinsic 
reward enhance job performance among Japanese employees.

OBJECTIVE: To profile the sick leave landscape in the United States.
DATA SOURCES: The 2011 Leave Supplement of the American Time Use Survey.
STUDY DESIGN: Bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify (i) employees 
without sick pay coverage and (ii) employees who attend work sick.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty-five percent of full-time employees have sick pay 
coverage. Coverage rates are below 20 percent for employees with hourly wages 
below $10, part-time employees, and employees in the hospitality and leisure 
industry.
CONCLUSION: Each week, up to 3 million U.S. employees go to work sick. Females, 
low-income earners, and those aged 25 to 34 years have a significantly elevated 
risk of presenteeism behavior.

BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a group of 
musculoskeletal disorders that comprise one of the most common disorders related 
to occupational sick leave worldwide. Musculoskeletal disorders accounted for 
21% to 28% of work absenteeism days in 2017/2018 in the Netherlands, Germany and 
the UK. There are several interventions that may be effective in tackling the 
high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among workers, such as 
physical, cognitive and organisational interventions. In this review, we will 
focus on work breaks as a measure of primary prevention, which are a type of 
organisational intervention.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of different work-break schedules for 
preventing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in healthy 
workers, when compared to conventional or alternate work-break schedules.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, 
ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform, to April/May 2019. In addition, we searched references 
of the included studies and of relevant literature reviews.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
work-break interventions for preventing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms 
and disorders among workers. The studies were eligible for inclusion when 
intervening on work-break frequency, duration and/or type, compared to 
conventional or an alternate work-break intervention. We included only those 
studies in which the investigated population included healthy, adult workers, 
who were free of musculoskeletal complaints during study enrolment, without 
restrictions to sex or occupation. The primary outcomes were newly diagnosed 
musculoskeletal disorders, self-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or 
fatigue, and productivity or work performance. We considered workload changes as 
secondary outcomes.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, 
abstracts and full texts for study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk 
of bias. We contacted authors for additional study data where required. We 
performed meta-analyses, where possible, and we assessed the overall quality of 
the evidence for each outcome of each comparison using the five GRADE 
considerations.
MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies (373 workers), four parallel RCTs, one 
cross-over RCT, and one combined parallel plus cross-over RCT. At least 295 of 
the employees were female and at least 39 male; for the remaining 39 employees, 
the sex was not specified in the study trial. The studies investigated different 
work-break frequencies (five studies) and different work-break types (two 
studies). None of the studies investigated different work-break durations. We 
judged all studies to have a high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for 
the primary outcomes of self-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and 
fatigue was low; the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of 
productivity and work performance was very low. The studies were executed in 
Europe or Northern America, with none from low- to middle-income countries. One 
study could not be included in the data analyses, because no detailed results 
have been reported.Changes in the frequency of work breaksThere is low-quality 
evidence that additional work breaks may not have a considerable effect on 
musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared with no additional 
work breaks (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.08; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.18; 
three studies; 225 participants). Additional breaks may not have a positive 
effect on productivity or work performance, when compared with no additional 
work breaks (SMD -0.07; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.19; three studies; 225 participants; 
very low-quality evidence).We found low-quality evidence that additional work 
breaks may not have a considerable effect on participant-reported 
musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue (MD 1.80 on a 100-mm VAS scale; 95% 
CI -41.07 to 64.37; one study; 15 participants), when compared to work breaks as 
needed (i.e. microbreaks taken at own discretion). There is very low-quality 
evidence that additional work breaks may have a positive effect on productivity 
or work performance, when compared to work breaks as needed (MD 542.5 number of 
words typed per 3-hour recording session; 95% CI 177.22 to 907.78; one study; 15 
participants).Additional higher frequency work breaks may not have a 
considerable effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or 
fatigue (MD 11.65 on a 100-mm VAS scale; 95% CI -41.07 to 64.37; one study; 10 
participants; low-quality evidence), when compared to additional lower frequency 
work breaks. We found very low-quality evidence that additional higher frequency 
work breaks may not have a considerable effect on productivity or work 
performance (MD -83.00 number of words typed per 3-hour recording session; 95% 
CI -305.27 to 139.27; one study; 10 participants), when compared to additional 
lower frequency work breaks.Changes in the duration of work breaksNo trials were 
identified that assessed the effect of different durations of work 
breaks.Changes in the type of work breakWe found low-quality evidence that 
active breaks may not have a considerable positive effect on 
participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue (MD -0.17 on a 
1-7 NRS scale; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.37; one study; 153 participants), when compared 
to passive work breaks.Relaxation work breaks may not have a considerable effect 
on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, when 
compared to physical work breaks (MD 0.20 on a 1-7 NRS scale; 95% CI -0.43 to 
0.82; one study; 97 participants; low-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-quality evidence that different work-break 
frequencies may have no effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, 
discomfort and fatigue. For productivity and work performance, evidence was of 
very low-quality that different work-break frequencies may have a positive 
effect. For different types of break, there may be no effect on 
participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue according to 
low-quality evidence. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the 
effectiveness of frequency, duration and type of work-break interventions among 
workers, if possible, with much higher sample sizes than the studies included in 
the current review. Furthermore, work-break interventions should be 
reconsidered, taking into account worker populations other than office workers, 
and taking into account the possibility of combining work-break intervention 
with other interventions such as ergonomic training or counselling, which may 
may possibly have an effect on musculoskeletal outcomes and work performance.

OBJECTIVE: High levels of occupational physical activity (OPA) increase heart 
rate, blood pressure (BP) and the risk of hypertension. Older workers may be 
more vulnerable to high levels of OPA due to age-related degeneration of the 
cardiovascular system and cardiorespiratory fitness. This study investigates the 
association of relative aerobic workload (RAW) with resting BP and examines if 
this relation is moderated by age.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional epidemiological study.
SETTING: Data were collected among employees of 15 Danish companies in the 
cleaning, manufacturing and transport sectors.
PARTICIPANTS: 2107 employees were invited for participation, of these 1087 
accepted and 562 (42% female and 4% non-Westerns) were included in the analysis 
based on the criteria of being non-pregnant, no allergy to bandages, sufficient 
amount of heart rate data corresponding to ≥4 work hours per workday or 75% of 
average work hours, and no missing outcome and confounder values.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was BP.
RESULTS: Heart rate reserve was estimated from ambulatory 24-hour heart rate 
measures covering 2.5 workdays per participant (SD 1.0 day). Age significantly 
moderated the association between RAW and BP. Mean intensity and duration of 
high RAW (≥30% heart rate reserve) showed positive associations with diastolic 
BP and negative associations with pulse pressure (PP) among participants ≥47 
years old. Tendencies towards negative associations between RAW and BP were seen 
among participants <47 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: Mean intensity and duration of RAW increased diastolic BP among 
participants ≥47 years old. Negative associations with PP may be due to healthy 
worker selection bias. Prevention of hypertension should consider reductions in 
RAW for ageing workers.

3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto 390-8621, Japan. uchida01@shinshu-u.ac.jp.

BACKGROUND: As detailed associations between personality and long work hours are 
unclear, we assessed associations between personality dimensions and overtime 
work among Japanese white-collar workers.
METHODS: From records of hours worked over 12 months by 267 office workers in an 
organization within the service industry, average overtime work hours per month 
and occurrence of excessive overtime was determined for each worker. Excessive 
overtime was defined as >  45 overtime work hours per month for at least one 
month. Responses to a questionnaire assessing socio-demographic and 
workplace-related factors and the Big Five personality test were analyzed. 
Associations between personality factors and overtime work were assessed by 
multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Low Extraversion was associated with excessive overtime work (OR 2.02, 
95%CI 1.02 - 4.02, P =  0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that workers with low Extraversion can't share work 
when busy to avoid excessive overtime. Personality factors should be considered 
in studies evaluating work time. Moreover, strengthening communication among 
workers with low Extraversion may reduce excessive overtime work and associated 
health problems.

Musculoskeletal disorders among Thai women in construction-related work.

Hanklang S(1), Kaewboonchoo O, Silpasuwan P, Mungarndee SS.

Author information:
(1)1Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of 
musculoskeletal disorder symptoms and its risk factors among women rebar 
workers. A simple random sampling method was used and data were collected by 
face-to-face interview and ergonomic assessment from February to March 2011. A 
total of 272 women rebar workers with at least 6 months' job experience 
participated in this study. The findings revealed that 57.7% of workers reported 
musculoskeletal disorder symptoms with low back and shoulders as the most common 
body parts affected (46.0%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated 2 
variables that are significantly associated with musculoskeletal disorders: 
prolonged working hours (adjusted odds ratio = 7.63; 95% confidence interval = 
2.06-28.31) and awkward posture (adjusted odds ratio = 43.79; 95% confidence 
interval = 17.09-112.20). The high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among 
women rebar workers suggests that an appropriate ergonomic workstation design 
and ergonomic training for women rebar workers are necessary.

AIM: This study investigated and compared the associations between self-reported 
exposures to individual as well as work-related physical and psychosocial risk 
factors for musculoskeletal (MS) disorders and the prevalence of MS symptoms in 
different body areas among short- (P&D) and long-distance (Bulk delivery) truck 
drivers working for the same large gas delivery company in Canada.
METHODS: 123 truck drivers nationwide participated in this questionnaire-based 
cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: 43.1% of drivers reported MS pain in at least one body area over the 
past 12 months and 26.8% over the past 7 days. Bulk drivers had a significantly 
higher prevalence of MS pain than P&D drivers for both periods. When P&D and 
Bulk drivers were pooled together, belonging to the Bulk subgroup emerged as the 
strongest factor for low back pain (OR = 8.45, p = 0.002), for shoulder pain 
(OR = 3.70, p = 0.027) and for MS pain in any body area (OR = 4.05, p = 0.006). 
In Bulk drivers "High effort-reward imbalance" was strongly associated with MS 
pain in any body area (OR = 6.47, p = 0.01), with shoulder pain (OR = 4.95, 
p = 0.016), and with low back pain (OR = 4.51, p = 0.02). In P&D drivers MS pain 
in any body area was strongly associated with "Working with hands above 
shoulders" (OR = 6.58, p = 0.009) and "Whole-body vibration" (OR = 5.48, 
p = 0.018), while shoulder pain was strongly associated with "Hand-arm 
vibration" (OR = 7.27, p = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of MS pain was higher among industrial gas delivery 
truck drivers than in the general Quebec male worker population, and higher for 
Bulk drivers compared to P&D drivers. MS pain in Bulk drivers was mainly 
associated with psychosocial risk factors and lifestyle; MS pain in P&D drivers 
was mainly associated with physical risk factors.

Pay Matters: The Piece Rate and Health in the Developing World.

Davis ME(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning, Tufts University, 
Medford, MA. Electronic address: Mary.Davis@tufts.edu.

BACKGROUND: Piece rate pay remains a common form of compensation in 
developing-world industries. While the piece rate may boost productivity, it has 
been shown to have unintended consequences for occupational safety and health, 
including increased accident and injury risk.
OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the relationship between worker pay and physical 
and emotional health, and questions the modern day business case for piece rate 
pay in the developing world.
METHODS: The relationship between piece rate and self-reported measures of 
physical and emotional health is estimated using a large survey of garment 
workers in 109 Vietnamese factories between 2010 and 2014. A random effects 
logit model controls for factory and year, predicting worker health as a 
function of pay type, demographics, and factory characteristics.
FINDINGS: Workers paid by the piece report worse physical and emotional health 
than workers paid by the hour (OR = 1.38-1.81). Wage incentives provide the most 
consistently significant evidence of all demographic and factory-level 
variables, including the factory's own performance on occupational safety and 
health compliance measures.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of how workers are paid to 
understanding the variability in worker health outcomes. More research is needed 
to better understand the business case supporting the continued use of piece

OBJECTIVES: Immigrant workers frequently take jobs that are physically 
demanding, provide low wages, and result in injuries (e.g., poultry production 
and processing). Through a qualitative approach, this paper elicits poultry 
workers' evaluations of their jobs and set them in the larger context of their 
lives.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 poultry workers in 
western North Carolina. Workers were asked to discuss job characteristics, 
physical and psychological impacts of their employment, and perceived health 
risks.
RESULTS: Immigrant workers valued the stability, benefits, upward mobility, and 
pay offered. They disliked the physical demands, the potential perceived effects 
of the job on their health, and the interactions with bosses and peers.
CONCLUSIONS: Workers' willingness to endure dirty, dangerous, and demanding 
(3-D) conditions of poultry must be understood in the context of other 
employment options, structural violence, and their focus on immediate family 
needs that positive aspects of these jobs can fulfill. Am. J. Ind. Med.
