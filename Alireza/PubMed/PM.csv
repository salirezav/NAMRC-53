29577838,Effort-Reward Imbalance and Work Productivity Among Hotel Housekeeping Employees:        A Pilot Study.,"['Rosemberg MS', 'Li Y']",Workplace Health Saf,"This study explored the relationship between effort-reward imbalance (ERI) at        work and work productivity among hotel housekeepers. A community-based approach        was used to recruit 23 hotel housekeepers who completed the ERI and Work        Performance Questionnaires. Work productivity was determined by combining        self-report absenteeism and presenteeism. More than 40% of the participants        reported high ERI (ERI >1). Also, 59.1% reported low work productivity.        Interestingly, despite the individualized high reports of ERI and low work        productivity, correlation analysis showed that high ERI was correlated with high        presenteeism and work productivity as a whole. This is the first study to explore        work productivity among this worker group. Despite the small sample size and the        cross-sectional nature of the study, this study points to the need for        organization-based interventions to not only improve employee health but also        their work productivity.

,Evaluation of absenteeism and presenteeism status of factory employees.,"['Oral B', 'Solak Y', 'Durmuş H']",Work,"BACKGROUND: While absenteeism refers to not attending work, presenteeism is        defined as not being present at work. These two conditions, which negatively        affect employee health, can be indicators of work efficiency, work peace, work        safety and work engagement. OBJECTIVE: Several factors were evaluated in this        study concerning absenteeism and presenteeism among factory workers. METHODS:        This cross-sectional study was conducted among workers in a factory operating in        a heavy industry in southern Turkey in 2021. A survey consisting of 57 questions        was applied to 152 factory workers by face-to-face interview method. The        participants' behaviour over the last month was evaluated regarding absenteeism        and presenteeism. RESULTS: It was reported that 24 (15.8%) of all employees were        absent from work in the last month (absenteeism), excluding holidays and sick        leave, and that 20 (13.2%) employees engaged in presenteeism, working when they        should not have been at the workplace. There was a high absenteeism rate among        employees who had an acute illness and were dissatisfied with their jobs. Several        factors have been associated with presenteeism, including poor economic        conditions, family health problems, previous unemployment, working overtime, job        dissatisfaction, poor relationships with colleagues and difficulty finding a        replacement, acute illness, sleep problems and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: To increase        the productivity and commitment of employees, it may be useful to identify the        reasons for absenteeism and present behaviours, to facilitate effective        interpersonal communication skills by examining the organisational climate of        employees, and to regulate workload based on a comprehensive assessment of the        health status of employees.

,Urinary symptoms and infections among female garment factory workers in        Bangladesh.,"['Moran J', 'Fitch TJ', 'Villanueva G', 'Quadir MM', 'Chien LC', 'Alamgir H']",Work,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of urinary symptoms and infections among female        garment factory workers in Bangladesh - a large developing country - is largely        unknown. Garment sector is this country's main economic growth engine.        OBJECTIVES: This paper focuses on garment industry workers and compares the        findings with another group of low socioeconomic status working women. METHODS:        Urinary tract symptoms (UTS) were determined by self-reported survey including        International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Female Lower        Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS) and urinary tract infection (UTI) was        determined among a subset population by urine dipstick tests. RESULTS: Data were        collected from 310 garment workers and 297 comparison workers. About one third of        garment workers (31.94%) and comparison workers (29.97%) could take up to 3        toilet breaks in a day. Garment workers reported to be more sexually active and        menstruation was more common among them compared to comparison workers. They        reported a significantly higher prevalence of malodorous urine and vaginal        discharge. Garment workers were found to have a significantly higher ICIQ-FLUTS        score of voiding than comparison workers (0.44 vs. 0.27; p-value = 0.0167).Among        the study respondents, 148 garment workers and 134 other workers provided urine        samples and 21 (7.45%) were found to have UTI. After considering all the risk        factors in multivariate model, garment work had a significant impact on the        probability of having UTI with Odds Ratio of 5.46 (p-value = 0.0374; 95%        CI = 1.10, 26.97) compared to other workers. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights        the prevalence and burden of urinary symptoms and infections among female worker        populations in Bangladesh.

,Connotations of psychological and physiological health in the psychosocial work        environment: An industrial context.,"['Javaid MU', 'Bano S', 'Mirza MZ', 'Isha ASN', 'Nadeem S', 'Jawaid A', 'Ghazali Z', 'Nübling M', 'Imtiaz N', 'Kaur P']",Work,"BACKGROUND: Psychological conditions are experiences of the conscious and        unconscious elements of the work context, which revolve around workers'        perceptions of feeling either engaged or disengaged with the assigned tasks. In        the psychosocial work environment of hazardous industries like petrochemicals        where production lasts twenty-four hours a day and continues seven-days-a-week, a        psychologically available worker is extremely important. Psychological        availability refers to when workers who are physically, emotionally and        psychologically engaged at the moment of performing tasks. OBJECTIVE: The broad        objective of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of        behavioral factors on the psychological and physiological health of workers.        METHODS: The latest, second generation technique, which is structural equation        modeling, is used to identify the relationships between behavioral antecedents        and health outcomes. A total of 277 technical workers participated, aged between        20 and 49 and were healthy in all aspects. RESULTS: The study results showed        quantitative demands, emotional demands, work-family conflict, and job insecurity        were significantly associated with both psychological (stress) and physiological        (Body Mass Index) factors. The social support of colleagues produced mixed        findings with direct and indirect paths. Stress also significantly mediates the        psychosocial factors and burnout of the workers. CONCLUSION: The study concluded        that workers were physically available, but they experienced distractions as        members of social systems, affecting their physiological and psychological        health.

,Ergonomic risk factor identification for sewing machine operators through        supervised occupational therapy fieldwork in Bangladesh: A case study.,['Habib MM'],Work,"BACKGROUND: Many sewing machine operators are working with high risk factors for        musculoskeletal health in the garments industries in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: To        identify the physical risk factors among sewing machine operators in a        Bangladeshi garments factory. PARTICIPANTS: Sewing machine operators (327, 83%        female), were evaluated. The mean age of the participants was 25.25 years.        METHODS AND MATERIALS: Six ergonomic risk factors were determined using the        Musculoskeletal Disorders risk assessment. Data collection included measurements        of sewing machine table and chair heights; this data was combined with        information from informal interviews. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Significant        ergonomic risk factors found included the combination of awkward postures of the        neck and back, repetitive hand and arm movements, poor ergonomic workstations and        prolonged working hours without adequate breaks; these risk factors resulted in        musculoskeletal complaints, sick leave, and switching jobs. CONCLUSIONS: One        aspect of improving worker health in garment factories includes addressing        musculoskeletal risk factors through ergonomic interventions.

,Change in job stress and job satisfaction over a two-year interval using the        Brief Job Stress Questionnaire.,"['Kawada T', 'Otsuka T']",Work,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between job stress and job satisfaction by the        follow-up study should be more evaluated for workers' health support. OBJECTIVE:        Job stress is strongly affected by the content of the job and the personality of        a worker. This study was focused on determining the changes of the job stress and        job satisfaction levels over a two-year interval, using the Brief Job Stress        Questionnaire (BJSQ). METHODS: This self-administered questionnaire was        distributed to the same 310 employees of a Japanese industrial company in 2009        and 2011. Sixty-one employees were lost from 371 responders in 2009. Data of 16        items from 57 items graded on a four-point Likert-type scale to measure the job        stressors, psycho-physical complaints and support for workers, job overload (six        items), job control (three items), support (six items) and job satisfaction score        (one item) were selected for the analysis. RESULTS: The age-adjusted partial        correlation coefficients for job overload, job control and support were 0.684 (p<        0.001), 0.474 (p< 0.001) and 0.612 (p< 0.001), respectively. The concordance        correlation coefficient (and 95% confidence interval indicated within        parentheses) for job overload, job control and support were 0.681 (0.616-0.736),        0.473 (0.382-0.555), and 0.623 (0.549-0.687), respectively. There were no        significant differences in the mean score for job overload, job control or        support, although significant decline in the job satisfaction level was apparent        at the end of the two-year period (p< 0.05). There was also a significant decline        in the job satisfaction in 2009 and in 2011 for subjects with keeping low job        strain. CONCLUSIONS: No significant changes in the scores on the three elements        of job stress were observed over the two-year study period, and the job        satisfaction level deteriorated significantly during this period. There was a        decline in the job satisfaction in the two-year period, although subjects did not        suffer from job stress at the same period.

,Perceived stress in human-machine interaction in modern manufacturing        environments-Results of a qualitative interview study.,"['Körner U', 'Müller-Thur K', 'Lunau T', 'Dragano N', 'Angerer P', 'Buchner A']",Stress Health,"Rapid advances in digitization technologies are changing modern working        conditions especially in industrial settings. Consequently, employees are        confronted with new forms of human-machine interaction. Whether changes in        working conditions in general, and the increasing relevance of human-machine        interaction in particular, affect psychosocial working conditions, and employee's        health is currently matter of debate, but empirical data are lacking. Therefore,        we conducted semistructured interviews with 36 employees working in five        different companies. The interviews were aimed at identifying potential stressors        associated with the introduction and use of modern technologies in the        manufacturing industry. The results show that stressors linked to human-machine        interaction are technical problems, poor usability, low situation awareness, and        increased requirements on employees' qualification. For example, technical        problems such as breakdowns or slowdowns were described as a main stressor when        employees were not qualified to handle these problems on their own, thus        decelerating work flows and causing additional time pressure. Overall, the        results show that problems in human-machine interaction, which have been observed        in laboratory and nonindustrial settings, also apply to industrial work places        with highly automated working conditions and are a potential source of stress.        These factors should be considered in psychosocial risk assessment of        work-related stressors.",2019 Apr,35,2,187-199,10.1002/smi.2853

This study aims to develop a practical        judgement method to estimate the workload risk of individual construction        workers. Based on studies, we developed a workload model comprising a        hygrothermal environment, behavioral information, and the physical        characteristics of workers). The construction workers' heart rate and physical        activity were measured using the data collected from a wearable device equipped        with a biosensor and an acceleration sensor. This study is the first report to        use worker physical activity, age, and the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) to        determine a worker's physical workload. The accuracy of this health risk judgment        result was 89.2%, indicating that it is possible to easily judge the health risk        of workers even in an environment where it is difficult to measure the subject in        advance. The proposed model and its findings can aid in monitoring the health        impacts of working conditions during construction activities, and thereby        contribute toward determining workers' health damage. However, the sampled        construction workers are 12 workers, further studies in other working conditions        are required to accumulate more evidence and assure the accuracy of the models.

,Employment experiences of immigrant workers in aged care in regional South        Australia.,"['Goel K', 'Penman J']",Rural Remote Health,"PURPOSE: The contributions of immigrant workers to the aged care workforce cannot        be overemphasised. The report of the National Institute of Labour Studies records        a significant number of immigrants in the aged care industry in Australia. The        number of overseas-born workers in the residential aged care sector had risen        steadily, according to recent workforce statistics. However, the employment        positions these immigrant workers fill have perennially been labelled as        low-paying and low-status, warranting more research into the plight of immigrant        workers, especially those in regional areas. This study investigates the current        employment experience of immigrant workers working in aged care in regional South        Australia. METHODS: This qualitative study is based on a focus group consisting        of seven immigrant workers (five personal carers, one home support worker and one        allied health assistant), who shared their individual perceptions of their        employment experience. The workers were employed by three aged care facilities        run by a community-based not-for-profit organisation governed by one incorporated        body. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the focus group data. This article        reports on part of the findings of a larger research study where the authors have        included the perceptions of co-workers and managers about working with immigrant        workers. RESULTS: This study reveals mixed experiences of immigrant workers with        employment in aged care. Satisfaction came from positive and encouraging client        feedback, enriching work experience, flexible hours and simply having a job.        Dissatisfaction came from constraints with time, workload, staffing, poor peer        relations, discriminatory practices and the nature of the job itself. Immigrant        workers do not experience a strong support infrastructure. Limitations of the        study include the small sample size used and the focus on one regional city.        CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that aged care facility managers and executive        officers can enhance positive work experience of immigrant workers by making some        workplace reforms.

,"A capability perspective on sustainable employability: A Dutch focus group study        on organizational, work and personal conversion factors.","['Meerman J', 'van Casteren PAJ', 'Brouwers EPM', 'van Dam A', 'van der Klink JJL']",PLoS One,"OBJECTIVE: In the field of work, there is a shift towards more value-based        approaches to study the sustainable employability of the present-day worker. The        capability approach offers a value based and innovative conceptualisation and        framework of sustainable employability characterized by contextuality,        normativity and diversity. The capabilities of Dutch employees have been        established and validated, yet it is not known which conversion factors on a        personal, work and organizational level enable employees to achieve value in work        in different Dutch occupational sectors. METHODS: Our qualitative approach        included seven focus groups in different occupational sectors including elderly        care, higher education, insurance work, facility management and the oil-, car-        and chemical industry. Each focus group included 5-11 participants and took        approximately one and a half hour. A qualitative content analysis was used to        analyse the data, by combining deductive and inductive coding respectively.        Deductive coding involved assigning themes to the conversion of resources into        capabilities at the organizational, work and personal level. RESULTS: On the        organizational conversion level, important themes were cultural aspects, power        relations, shortage of personnel and policies for self-management. On the work        conversion level, social contacts, communication and workload, tasks and        schedules were identified. Social contacts were described as a work value in        itself, but also conditional for achieving other work values. On the personal        conversion level, experienced work stress, motivation and the ability to achieve        values informally within the company. CONCLUSION: From our findings it follows        that focus groups are sensitive to identify conversion factors on all three        levels of conversion. In addition, companies and their employees might        effectively increase work capabilities by being sensitive to all three conversion        levels simultaneously. Further research is necessary to study the effect of a        capability-based intervention at the work floor. FAU - Meerman, Jan",2022,17,10,e0274000,10.1371/journal.pone.0274000
,Impact of heavy load activity on cardiovascular system: echocardiographic        assessment of informal construction workers heart in Cameroon.,"['Nde F', 'Nebo J', 'Ngatchou W', 'Tchatchoua C', 'Sone AM', 'De Brouwer C']",Pan Afr Med J,"INTRODUCTION: Physiological cardiac hypertrophy and dilation are common findings        in heavy physical load activity. We carried out this study to investigate the        relationship between construction work and cardiac parameters adaptations, by        comparing healthy masons to office workers on heart ultrasound. METHODS: The        study was carried out on, 50 construction workers and 50 office workers matched        for their weight, height and age. Systolic and Diastolic blood pressures, Left        Ventricular diameter and thickness, Septum wall thickness and Left ventricular        mass index were measured and calculated. RESULTS: Heart rate, systolic and        diastolic blood pressures were lower in construction workers, as compared to        office workers: respectively 63±7 bpm vs. 75±6 bpm (p = 0.000); 120.1±7 mmHg vs.        130.5±9 mmHg (p = 0.000) and 68.5±7 mmHg vs. 77.0 ±9 mmHg (p = 0.000).        Construction workers had a thicker septum and posterior wall: respectively 10.3 ±        1.1 mm vs. 8.9 ± 0.9 mm (p = 0.000); and 9.0 ± 1.2 mm vs. 8.1 ± 0.8 mm (p =        0.000). CONCLUSION: Conclusion We deducted that heavy load work has an impact on        the heart mensuration.

,The Job Accommodation Scale (JAS): psychometric evaluation of a new measure of        employer support for temporary job modifications.,"['Shaw WS', 'Kristman VL', 'Williams-Whitt K', 'Soklaridis S', 'Huang YH', 'Côté P', 'Loisel P']",J Occup Rehabil,"INTRODUCTION: An employer offer of temporary job modification is a key strategy        for facilitating return-to-work for musculoskeletal conditions, but there are no        validated scales to assess the level of support for temporary job modifications        across a range of job types and organizations. OBJECTIVE: To pilot test a new        21-item self-report measure [the Job Accommodation Scale (JAS)] to assess its        applicability, internal consistency, factor structure, and relation to physical        job demands. METHODS: Supervisors (N = 804, 72.8 % male, mean age = 46) were        recruited from 19 employment settings in the USA and Canada and completed a        30-min online survey regarding job modification practices. As part of the survey,        supervisors nominated and described a job position they supervised and completed        the JAS for a hypothetical worker (in that position) with an episode of low back        pain. Job characteristics were derived from the occupational informational        network job classification database. RESULTS: The full response range (1-4) was        utilized on all 21 items, with no ceiling or floor effects. Avoiding awkward        postures was the most feasible accommodation and moving the employee to a        different site or location was the least feasible. An exploratory factor analysis        suggested five underlying factors (Modify physical workload; Modify work        environment; Modify work schedule; Find alternate work; and Arrange for        assistance), and there was an acceptable goodness-of-fit for the five parceled        sub-factor scores as a single latent construct in a measurement model (structural        equation model). Job accommodations were less feasible for more physical jobs and        for heavier industries. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot administration of the JAS with        respect to a hypothetical worker with low back pain showed initial support for        its applicability, reliability, and validity when administered to supervisors.        Future studies should assess its validity for use in actual disability cases, for        a range of health conditions, and to assess different stakeholder opinions about        the feasibility of job accommodation strategies.

LID - 10.1093/joccuh/uiae060 [doi] LID - uiae060,"['Kazar G', 'Rahmanzadeh P']",J Occup Health,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding the impact of job demands and mental health disorders        on individual job performance is crucial to achieving a more productive workforce        and should be empirically investigated. Therefore, the main purpose of this study        was to assess the impact of job demands and mental health disorders on individual        job performance among construction workers. In addition, we examined the        interaction effect between job demands and some demographic characteristics        (income, marital status, experience, and area of residence) on the job        performance of construction workers in 2 dimensions. METHODS: For this purpose, a        new conceptual model and 3 different hypotheses were introduced. A survey was        designed and administered to 513 construction workers. Whereas the measurement        items regarding demographic characteristics, job demands, and mental health        disorders were addressed to construction workers, the last part related to job        performance of construction workers was conducted with site managers of the        workers to obtain more objective results. A structural equation modeling approach        was adopted to assess the validity of the model and to test the hypotheses.        RESULTS: The results of this study show that whereas job demands have a        significant and high impact on individual job performance, the effect of mental        health disorders on job performance is significant at a moderate level. In        addition, the demographic characteristics of marital status and area of residence        have a significant interaction effect on job performance when combined with job        demands.

,Predictors of Attitudes Toward Non-Technical Skills in Farming.,"['Irwin A', 'Poots J']",J Agromedicine,"OBJECTIVES: Farming is a high-risk sector with up to 170,000 worldwide fatalities        reported per year; it is therefore vital to identify methods of mitigating the        dangers of this industry. Research within high-risk industries, such as aviation,        shipping, and agriculture, has identified the importance of non-technical skills        (NTS) in maintaining effective, safe performance and reducing error and injury.        However, there is a lack of research evaluating factors that may contribute to        NTS attitudes and behaviors. As a first step to address this literature gap, the        current study evaluated a range of individual and environmental factors as        potential predictors of attitudes toward NTS in agriculture. METHOD: A sample of        170 farmers from within the United Kingdom and Ireland were surveyed using an        online questionnaire. The questionnaire included measures of personality, stress,        attitudes toward safety (safety climate, motivation, and risk), environmental        stressors (workload, work-life imbalance), and non-technical skills (team and        lone worker). RESULTS: Attitudes toward safety climate, compliance, and        motivation showed a significant association with both team-based and lone worker        NTS. Conscientiousness correlated positively with the majority of the NTS        elements. Multiple regression analysis indicated neuroticism and        conscientiousness demonstrated capacity to predict NTS attitudes. Concerns about        costs and equipment, attitudes toward safety climate, and safety motivation were        also found to be significant predictors of NTS attitudes. CONCLUSION: The results        indicate the utility of individual characteristics and environmental factors when        predicting farming NTS attitudes.

,"Associations between worker characteristics, workplace factors, and work-related        musculoskeletal disorders: a cross-sectional study of male construction workers        in Nigeria.","['Ekpenyong CE', 'Inyang UC']",Int J Occup Saf Ergon,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the association between worker characteristics,        workplace factors, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in        Nigeria's construction industry. METHODS: A cross-sectional site-by-site survey        was conducted in 5 existing construction companies in Uyo, Nigeria. The subjects        (n = 1200 males), aged 18-55 years, filled in the semistructured Nordic        musculoskeletal questionnaire and the job content questionnaire on demographics,        work and lifestyle characteristics, and workplace risk factors for WMSDs.        RESULTS: The overall prevalence of WMSDs was 39.25%. Differences in age, race,        weight, body mass index (BMI), education status, and employment status were        significantly associated with the prevalence of WMSDs. Prevalence according to        trade was as follows: ironworkers highest at 49% and administrative staff lowest        at 31%. Ironworkers (55.7%), administrative staff (53.3%), and security staff        (38.7%) scored higher on physical, psychosocial, and individual risk factors,        respectively. Workplace factors with increased odds for WMSDs were psychological        demands and mental workload, age, BMI, low work experience, low education status,        awkward movement of head and arms, working against force or vibration, fast work        pace, and race. CONCLUSION: The recorded high prevalence was multifactorial in        etiology; hence, multi-intervention strategies are required.

,Work-break schedules for preventing musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in        healthy workers.,"['Luger T', 'Maher CG', 'Rieger MA', 'Steinhilber B']",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a group of musculoskeletal        disorders that comprise one of the most common disorders related to occupational        sick leave worldwide. Musculoskeletal disorders accounted for 21% to 28% of work        absenteeism days in 2017/2018 in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. There are        several interventions that may be effective in tackling the high prevalence of        work-related musculoskeletal disorders among workers, such as physical, cognitive        and organisational interventions. In this review, we will focus on work breaks as        a measure of primary prevention, which are a type of organisational intervention.        OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of different work-break schedules for        preventing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in healthy        workers, when compared to conventional or alternate work-break schedules. SEARCH        METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials        (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science,        ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical        Trials Registry Platform, to April/May 2019. In addition, we searched references        of the included studies and of relevant literature reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA:        We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of work-break interventions for        preventing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders among workers. The        studies were eligible for inclusion when intervening on work-break frequency,        duration and/or type, compared to conventional or an alternate work-break        intervention. We included only those studies in which the investigated population        included healthy, adult workers, who were free of musculoskeletal complaints        during study enrolment, without restrictions to sex or occupation. The primary        outcomes were newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders, self-reported        musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, and productivity or work        performance. We considered workload changes as secondary outcomes. DATA        COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles,        abstracts and full texts for study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk        of bias. We contacted authors for additional study data where required. We        performed meta-analyses, where possible, and we assessed the overall quality of        the evidence for each outcome of each comparison using the five GRADE        considerations. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies (373 workers), four        parallel RCTs, one cross-over RCT, and one combined parallel plus cross-over RCT.        At least 295 of the employees were female and at least 39 male; for the remaining        39 employees, the sex was not specified in the study trial. The studies        investigated different work-break frequencies (five studies) and different        work-break types (two studies). None of the studies investigated different        work-break durations. We judged all studies to have a high risk of bias. The        quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of self-reported musculoskeletal        pain, discomfort and fatigue was low; the quality of the evidence for the primary        outcomes of productivity and work performance was very low. The studies were        executed in Europe or Northern America, with none from low- to middle-income        countries. One study could not be included in the data analyses, because no        detailed results have been reported.Changes in the frequency of work breaksThere        is low-quality evidence that additional work breaks may not have a considerable        effect on musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared with no        additional work breaks (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.08; 95% CI -0.35 to        0.18; three studies; 225 participants). Additional breaks may not have a positive        effect on productivity or work performance, when compared with no additional work        breaks (SMD -0.07; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.19; three studies; 225 participants; very        low-quality evidence).We found low-quality evidence that additional work breaks        may not have a considerable effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain,        discomfort or fatigue (MD 1.80 on a 100-mm VAS scale; 95% CI -41.07 to 64.37; one        study; 15 participants), when compared to work breaks as needed (i.e. microbreaks        taken at own discretion). There is very low-quality evidence that additional work        breaks may have a positive effect on productivity or work performance, when        compared to work breaks as needed (MD 542.5 number of words typed per 3-hour        recording session; 95% CI 177.22 to 907.78; one study; 15        participants).Additional higher frequency work breaks may not have a considerable        effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue (MD        11.65 on a 100-mm VAS scale; 95% CI -41.07 to 64.37; one study; 10 participants;        low-quality evidence), when compared to additional lower frequency work breaks.        We found very low-quality evidence that additional higher frequency work breaks        may not have a considerable effect on productivity or work performance (MD -83.00        number of words typed per 3-hour recording session; 95% CI -305.27 to 139.27; one        study; 10 participants), when compared to additional lower frequency work        breaks.Changes in the duration of work breaksNo trials were identified that        assessed the effect of different durations of work breaks.Changes in the type of        work breakWe found low-quality evidence that active breaks may not have a        considerable positive effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain,        discomfort and fatigue (MD -0.17 on a 1-7 NRS scale; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.37; one        study; 153 participants), when compared to passive work breaks.Relaxation work        breaks may not have a considerable effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal        pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared to physical work breaks (MD 0.20 on a        1-7 NRS scale; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.82; one study; 97 participants; low-quality        evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-quality evidence that different        work-break frequencies may have no effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal        pain, discomfort and fatigue. For productivity and work performance, evidence was        of very low-quality that different work-break frequencies may have a positive        effect. For different types of break, there may be no effect on        participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue according to        low-quality evidence. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the        effectiveness of frequency, duration and type of work-break interventions among        workers, if possible, with much higher sample sizes than the studies included in        the current review. Furthermore, work-break interventions should be reconsidered,        taking into account worker populations other than office workers, and taking into        account the possibility of combining work-break intervention with other        interventions such as ergonomic training or counselling, which may may possibly        have an effect on musculoskeletal outcomes and work performance.

,Associations between occupational relative aerobic workload and resting blood        pressure among different age groups: a cross-sectional analysis in the DPhacto        study.,"['Korshøj M', 'Clays E', 'Krause N', 'Gupta N', 'Jørgensen MB', 'Holtermann A']",BMJ Open,"OBJECTIVE: High levels of occupational physical activity (OPA) increase heart        rate, blood pressure (BP) and the risk of hypertension. Older workers may be more        vulnerable to high levels of OPA due to age-related degeneration of the        cardiovascular system and cardiorespiratory fitness. This study investigates the        association of relative aerobic workload (RAW) with resting BP and examines if        this relation is moderated by age. DESIGN: Cross-sectional epidemiological study.        SETTING: Data were collected among employees of 15 Danish companies in the        cleaning, manufacturing and transport sectors. PARTICIPANTS: 2107 employees were        invited for participation, of these 1087 accepted and 562 (42% female and 4%        non-Westerns) were included in the analysis based on the criteria of being        non-pregnant, no allergy to bandages, sufficient amount of heart rate data        corresponding to ≥4 work hours per workday or 75% of average work hours, and no        missing outcome and confounder values. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:        The primary outcome measure was BP. RESULTS: Heart rate reserve was estimated        from ambulatory 24-hour heart rate measures covering 2.5 workdays per participant        (SD 1.0 day). Age significantly moderated the association between RAW and BP.        Mean intensity and duration of high RAW (≥30% heart rate reserve) showed positive        associations with diastolic BP and negative associations with pulse pressure (PP)        among participants ≥47 years old. Tendencies towards negative associations        between RAW and BP were seen among participants <47 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Mean        intensity and duration of RAW increased diastolic BP among participants ≥47 years        old. Negative associations with PP may be due to healthy worker selection bias.        Prevention of hypertension should consider reductions in RAW for ageing workers.",2019 Sep 24,9,9,e029713,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029713
,Effects of personality on overtime work: a cross-sectional pilot study among        Japanese white-collar workers.,"['Uchida M', 'Kaneko M', 'Kawa S']",BMC Res Notes,"BACKGROUND: As detailed associations between personality and long work hours are        unclear, we assessed associations between personality dimensions and overtime        work among Japanese white-collar workers. METHODS: From records of hours worked        over 12 months by 267 office workers in an organization within the service        industry, average overtime work hours per month and occurrence of excessive        overtime was determined for each worker. Excessive overtime was defined as >  45        overtime work hours per month for at least one month. Responses to a        questionnaire assessing socio-demographic and workplace-related factors and the        Big Five personality test were analyzed. Associations between personality factors        and overtime work were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.        RESULTS: Low Extraversion was associated with excessive overtime work (OR 2.02,        95%CI 1.02 - 4.02, P =  0.04). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that workers with low        Extraversion can't share work when busy to avoid excessive overtime. Personality        factors should be considered in studies evaluating work time. Moreover,        strengthening communication among workers with low Extraversion may reduce        excessive overtime work and associated health problems.

,Musculoskeletal disorders among Thai women in construction-related work.,"['Hanklang S', 'Kaewboonchoo O', 'Silpasuwan P', 'Mungarndee SS']",Asia Pac J Public Health,"A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of        musculoskeletal disorder symptoms and its risk factors among women rebar workers.        A simple random sampling method was used and data were collected by face-to-face        interview and ergonomic assessment from February to March 2011. A total of 272        women rebar workers with at least 6 months' job experience participated in this        study. The findings revealed that 57.7% of workers reported musculoskeletal        disorder symptoms with low back and shoulders as the most common body parts        affected (46.0%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated 2 variables        that are significantly associated with musculoskeletal disorders: prolonged        working hours (adjusted odds ratio = 7.63; 95% confidence interval = 2.06-28.31)        and awkward posture (adjusted odds ratio = 43.79; 95% confidence interval =        17.09-112.20). The high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among women rebar        workers suggests that an appropriate ergonomic workstation design and ergonomic        training for women rebar workers are necessary.

METHODS: 123        truck drivers nationwide participated in this questionnaire-based cross-sectional        study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.        RESULTS: 43.1% of drivers reported MS pain in at least one body area over the        past 12 months and 26.8% over the past 7 days. Bulk drivers had a significantly        higher prevalence of MS pain than P&D drivers for both periods. When P&D and Bulk        drivers were pooled together, belonging to the Bulk subgroup emerged as the        strongest factor for low back pain (OR = 8.45, p = 0.002), for shoulder pain        (OR = 3.70, p = 0.027) and for MS pain in any body area (OR = 4.05, p = 0.006).        In Bulk drivers ""High effort-reward imbalance"" was strongly associated with MS        pain in any body area (OR = 6.47, p = 0.01), with shoulder pain (OR = 4.95,        p = 0.016), and with low back pain (OR = 4.51, p = 0.02). In P&D drivers MS pain        in any body area was strongly associated with ""Working with hands above        shoulders"" (OR = 6.58, p = 0.009) and ""Whole-body vibration"" (OR = 5.48,        p = 0.018), while shoulder pain was strongly associated with ""Hand-arm vibration""        (OR = 7.27, p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of MS pain was higher among        industrial gas delivery truck drivers than in the general Quebec male worker        population, and higher for Bulk drivers compared to P&D drivers. MS pain in Bulk        drivers was mainly associated with psychosocial risk factors and lifestyle; MS        pain in P&D drivers was mainly associated with physical risk factors.",2018 Oct,72,,69-87,10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.005
,Pay Matters: The Piece Rate and Health in the Developing World.,['Davis ME'],Ann Glob Health,"BACKGROUND: Piece rate pay remains a common form of compensation in        developing-world industries. While the piece rate may boost productivity, it has        been shown to have unintended consequences for occupational safety and health,        including increased accident and injury risk. OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the        relationship between worker pay and physical and emotional health, and questions        the modern day business case for piece rate pay in the developing world. METHODS:        The relationship between piece rate and self-reported measures of physical and        emotional health is estimated using a large survey of garment workers in 109        Vietnamese factories between 2010 and 2014. A random effects logit model controls        for factory and year, predicting worker health as a function of pay type,        demographics, and factory characteristics. FINDINGS: Workers paid by the piece        report worse physical and emotional health than workers paid by the hour (OR =        1.38-1.81). Wage incentives provide the most consistently significant evidence of        all demographic and factory-level variables, including the factory's own        performance on occupational safety and health compliance measures. CONCLUSIONS:        These results highlight the importance of how workers are paid to understanding        the variability in worker health outcomes. More research is needed to better        understand the business case supporting the continued use of piece rate pay in        the developing world.",2016 Sep-Oct,82,5,858-865.e6,10.1016/j.aogh.2016.05.005
,"Good job, bad job: Occupational perceptions among Latino poultry workers.","['Mora DC', 'Arcury TA', 'Quandt SA']",Am J Ind Med,"OBJECTIVES: Immigrant workers frequently take jobs that are physically demanding,        provide low wages, and result in injuries (e.g., poultry production and        processing). Through a qualitative approach, this paper elicits poultry workers'        evaluations of their jobs and set them in the larger context of their lives.        METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 poultry workers in        western North Carolina. Workers were asked to discuss job characteristics,        physical and psychological impacts of their employment, and perceived health        risks. RESULTS: Immigrant workers valued the stability, benefits, upward        mobility, and pay offered. They disliked the physical demands, the potential        perceived effects of the job on their health, and the interactions with bosses        and peers. CONCLUSIONS: Workers' willingness to endure dirty, dangerous, and        demanding (3-D) conditions of poultry must be understood in the context of other        employment options, structural violence, and their focus on immediate family        needs that positive aspects of these jobs can fulfill.
