AB  - Industrial passive low-back exoskeletons have gained recent attention as 
      ergonomic interventions to manual handling tasks. This research utilized a 
      two-armed experimental approach (single vs dual-task paradigms) to quantify 
      neural and biomechanical tradeoffs associated with short-term human-exoskeleton 
      interaction (HEI) during asymmetrical lifting in twelve healthy adults balanced 
      by gender. A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that 
      indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested 
      exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. 
      Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we 
      found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor 
      adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain 
      networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical 
      response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the 
      mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of 
      ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate 
      dual-task manipulations.

AB  - Intracranial aneurysm is a common life-threatening disease. Computed tomography 
      angiography is recommended as the standard diagnosis tool; yet, interpretation 
      can be time-consuming and challenging. We present a specific deep-learning-based 
      model trained on 1,177 digital subtraction angiography verified bone-removal 
      computed tomography angiography cases. The model has good tolerance to image 
      quality and is tested with different manufacturers. Simulated real-world studies 
      are conducted in consecutive internal and external cohorts, in which it achieves 
      an improved patient-level sensitivity and lesion-level sensitivity compared to 
      that of radiologists and expert neurosurgeons. A specific cohort of suspected 
      acute ischemic stroke is employed and it is found that 99.0% predicted-negative 
      cases can be trusted with high confidence, leading to a potential reduction in 
      human workload. A prospective study is warranted to determine whether the 
      algorithm could improve patients' care in comparison to clinicians' assessment.

AB  - Higher-level cognition depends on the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), but its 
      functional organization has remained elusive. An influential proposal is that the 
      LPFC is organized hierarchically whereby progressively rostral areas of the LPFC 
      process/represent increasingly abstract information facilitating efficient and 
      flexible cognition. However, support for this theory has been limited. Here, 
      human fMRI data revealed rostral/caudal gradients of abstraction in the LPFC. 
      Dynamic causal modeling revealed asymmetrical LPFC interactions indicative of 
      hierarchical processing. Contrary to dominant assumptions, the relative strength 
      of efferent versus afferent connections positioned mid LPFC as the apex of the 
      hierarchy. Furthermore, cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations 
      towards mid LPFC consistent with a role in integrating information for control 
      operations. Moreover, the strengths of these dynamics were related to 
      trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability. Collectively, these results 
      suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized with the mid LPFC positioned to 
      synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior.

AB  - An improved understanding of how the brain allocates mental resources as a 
      function of task difficulty is critical for enhancing human performance. 
      Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a field-deployable optical brain 
      monitoring technology that provides a direct measure of cerebral blood flow in 
      response to cognitive activity. We found that fNIRS was sensitive to variations 
      in task difficulty in both real-life (flight simulator) and laboratory settings 
      (tests measuring executive functions), showing increased concentration of 
      oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and decreased concentration of deoxygenated 
      hemoglobin (HHb) in the prefrontal cortex as the tasks became more complex. 
      Intensity of prefrontal activation (HbO2 concentration) was not clearly 
      correlated to task performance. Rather, activation intensity shed insight on the 
      level of mental effort, i.e., how hard an individual was working to accomplish a 
      task. When combined with performance, fNIRS provided an estimate of the 
      participants' neural efficiency, and this efficiency was consistent across levels 
      of difficulty of the same task. Overall, our data support the suitability of 
      fNIRS to assess the mental effort related to human operations and represents a 
      promising tool for the measurement of neural efficiency in other contexts such as 
      training programs or the clinical setting.

AB  - Vigilance is the ability of an observer to maintain attention for extended 
      periods of time; however, performance tends to decline with time on watch, a 
      pattern referred to as the vigilance decrement. Previous research has focused on 
      factors that attenuate the decrement; however, one factor rarely studied is the 
      effect of social facilitation. The purpose for the present investigation was to 
      determine how different types of social presence affected the performance, 
      workload and stress of vigilance. It was hypothesised that the presence of a 
      supervisory figure would increase overall performance, but may occur at the cost 
      of increased workload and stress. Results indicated that the per cent of false 
      alarm and response times decreased in the presence of a supervisory figure. Using 
      social facilitation in vigilance tasks may thus have positive, as well as, 
      negative effects depending on the dependent measure of interest and the role of 
      the observer. Practitioner Summary: Social facilitation has rarely been examined 
      in the context of vigilance, even though it may improve performance. Vigilance 
      task performance was examined under social presence. The results of the present 
      study indicated that false alarms and response times decreased in the social 
      presence of a supervisory figure, thus improving performance.

TI  - Externally induced frontoparietal synchronization modulates network dynamics and 
      enhances working memory performance.

AB  - Cognitive functions such as working memory (WM) are emergent properties of 
      large-scale network interactions. Synchronisation of oscillatory activity might 
      contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, 
      causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and 
      behavior in humans is limited. Here we applied transcranial alternating current 
      stimulation (tACS) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right 
      frontoparietal network that supports WM. Externally induced synchronization 
      improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected 
      fMRI data reveals tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation 
      and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS 
      during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with 
      behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicate 
      that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow 
      within the WM network. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between 
      behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain 
      synchronization.

AB  - Brain atlases are fundamental to understanding the topographic organization of 
      the human brain, yet many contemporary human atlases cover only the cerebral 
      cortex, leaving the subcortex a terra incognita. We use functional MRI (fMRI) to 
      map the complex topographic organization of the human subcortex, revealing 
      large-scale connectivity gradients and new areal boundaries. We unveil four 
      scales of subcortical organization that recapitulate well-known anatomical nuclei 
      at the coarsest scale and delineate 27 new bilateral regions at the finest. 
      Ultrahigh field strength fMRI corroborates and extends this organizational 
      structure, enabling the delineation of finer subdivisions of the hippocampus and 
      the amygdala, while task-evoked fMRI reveals a subtle subcortical reorganization 
      in response to changing cognitive demands. A new subcortical atlas is delineated, 
      personalized to represent individual differences and used to uncover reproducible 
      brain-behavior relationships. Linking cortical networks to subcortical regions 
      recapitulates a task-positive to task-negative axis. This new atlas enables 
      holistic connectome mapping and characterization of cortico-subcortical 
      connectivity.

TI  - Specific eye-head coordination enhances vision in progressive lens wearers.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1167/16.11.5 [doi]
AB  - In uncorrected vision all combinations of eye and head positions are visually 
      equivalent; thus, there is no need for a specific modification of eye-head 
      coordination in young healthy observers. In contrast, the quality of visual input 
      indeed strongly depends on eye position in the majority of healthy elderly 
      drivers, namely in progressive additional lens (PALs) wearers. For a given 
      distance, only specific combinations of eye and head position provide clear 
      vision in a progressive lens wearer. However, although head movements are an 
      integral part of gaze behavior, it is not known if eye-head coordination takes 
      part in the enhancement of visual input in healthy individuals. In the current 
      study we determined changes in eye-head coordination in progressive lens wearers 
      in challenging tasks with high cognitive load, in the situation of driving. 
      During a real-world drive on an urban round track in Stuttgart, gaze movements 
      and head movements were measured in 17 PAL wearers and eye-head coordination was 
      compared to 27 controls with unrestricted vision. Head movement behavior, 
      specific to progressive lens wearers, was determined in head gain and temporal 
      properties of head movements. Furthermore, vertical eye-head coordination was 
      consistent only among PAL wearers. The observed differences in eye-head 
      coordination clearly demonstrate a contribution of head movements in the 
      enhancement of visual input in the healthy human visual system.

TI  - Primary HPV testing: a proposal for co-testing in initial rounds of screening to 
      optimise sensitivity of cervical cancer screening.
PG  - 9-15
LID - 10.1111/cyt.12334 [doi]
AB  - As explained by Kitchener in a previous issue of Cytopathology (2015;26:4-6), 
      primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is likely to be introduced in the UK 
      for all women aged 25-64 years following pilot site studies already in place. 
      This will be necessary when the prevalence of cervical cancer and its precursors 
      declines when vaccination takes effect but there is a risk in abandoning cytology 
      as a primary test: a risk that would be most apparent in the present unvaccinated 
      population in which the prevalence of cervical cancer and its precursors is 
      exceptionally high. HPV testing is more sensitive than cytology but has a 
      significant false-negative rate that could be detrimental to a successful 
      screening programme if introduced without cytology backup. Accurate cytology 
      would be needed for triage and could be compromised if HPV-negative tests were 
      excluded from examination. This article proposes a compromise: cytology and HPV 
      co-testing for the first two screening tests to optimise the sensitivity of the 
      test as a whole. Registrations of invasive and in situ carcinoma of the uterine 
      cervix in England indicate that the prevalence of the disease is highest in young 
      women in the early rounds of screening. Calculations of the likely impact on the 
      workload of this proposal have been based on a service evaluation of 295 cytology 
      tests received at St Thomas' Hospital, which suggests that the volume of cytology 
      tests would be reduced by approximately 60% compared with 80% for primary HPV 
      testing alone. This proposal should be debated openly before irrevocable changes 
      are made to a skilled workforce.

PG  - 149-60
LID - 10.1017/S0714980816000167 [doi]
AB  - This study explored qualitatively how residents of long-term care (LTC) 
      facilities feel about and adapt to the care they receive. We interviewed and 
      observed a purposeful selection of elderly residents in seven facilities 
      purporting to provide person-centred care. Interpretative descriptions from 43 
      personal interviews with 23 participants answered the question: How do residents 
      perceive the care rendered in LTC facilities purporting to offer person-centred 
      care? Three themes emerged: (1) the caring environment; (2) preservation of 
      dignity; and (3) maintenance of personal autonomy. Participants were sympathetic 
      to the nursing staff's workload, but felt distant from the staff. Participants 
      gave examples of poor care and lack of empathy, human indignities, and violations 
      of personal autonomy caused by institutional policies they felt inhibited their 
      ability to receive care based on their preferences. Overall, they challenged the 
      claims of person-centred care, but adapted to cope with an environment that 
      threatened their dignity and autonomy.

TI  - Automated evaluation of retinal pigment epithelium disease area in eyes with 
      age-related macular degeneration.

AB  - The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is essential for the survival and function 
      of retinal photoreceptor cells. RPE dysfunction causes various retinal diseases 
      including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Clinical studies on ES/iPS 
      cell-derived RPE transplantation for RPE dysfunction-triggered diseases are 
      currently underway. Quantification of the diseased RPE area is important to 
      evaluate disease progression or the therapeutic effect of RPE transplantation. 
      However, there are no standard protocols. To address this issue, we developed a 
      2-step software that enables objective and efficient quantification of 
      RPE-disease area changes by analyzing the early-phase hyperfluorescent area in 
      fluorescein angiography (FA) images. We extracted the Abnormal region. This 
      extraction was based on deep learning-based discrimination. We scored the 
      binarized extracted area using an automated program. Our program's performance 
      for the same eye from the serial image captures was within 3.1âÂ±â7.8% error. In 
      progressive AMD, the trend was consistent with human assessment, even when FA 
      images from two different visits were compared. This method was applicable to 
      quantifying RPE-disease area changes over time, evaluating iPSC-RPE 
      transplantation images, and a disease other than AMD. Our program may contribute 
      to the assessment of the clinical course of RPE-disease areas in routine clinics 
      and reduce the workload of researchers.

TI  - Vigilance Decrement During On-Road Partially Automated Driving Across Four 
      Systems.
PG  - 2179-2190

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study uses a detection task to measure changes in driver 
      vigilance when operating four different partially automated systems. BACKGROUND: 
      Research show temporal declines in detection task performance during manual and 
      fully automated driving, but the accuracy of using this approach for measuring 
      changes in driver vigilance during on-road partially automated driving is yet 
      unproven. METHOD: Participants drove four different vehicles (Tesla Model 3, 
      Cadillac CT6, Volvo XC90, and Nissan Rogue) equipped with level-2 systems in 
      manual and partially automated modes. Response times to a detection task were 
      recorded over eight consecutive time periods. RESULTS: Bayesian analysis revealed 
      a main effect of time period and an interaction between mode and time period. A 
      main effect of vehicle and a time period x vehicle interaction were also found. 
      CONCLUSION: Results indicated that the reduction in detection task performance 
      over time was worse during partially automated driving. Vehicle-specific analysis 
      also revealed that detection task performance changed across vehicles, with 
      slowest response time found for the Volvo. APPLICATION: The greater decline in 
      detection performance found in automated mode suggests that operating level-2 
      systems incurred in a greater vigilance decrement, a phenomenon that is of 
      interest for Human Factors practitioners and regulators. We also argue that the 
      observed vehicle-related differences are attributable to the unique design of 
      their in-vehicle interfaces.

AB  - Bayesian models of cognition assume that people compute probability distributions 
      over hypotheses. However, the required computations are frequently intractable or 
      prohibitively expensive. Since people often encounter many closely related 
      distributions, selective reuse of computations (amortized inference) is a 
      computationally efficient use of the brain's limited resources. We present three 
      experiments that provide evidence for amortization in human probabilistic 
      reasoning. When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, 
      participants' responses to the second query systematically depend on the 
      structure of the first query. This influence is sensitive to the content of the 
      queries, only appearing when the queries are related. Using a cognitive load 
      manipulation, we find evidence that people amortize summary statistics of 
      previous inferences, rather than storing the entire distribution. These findings 
      support the view that the brain trades off accuracy and computational cost, to 
      make efficient use of its limited cognitive resources to approximate 
      probabilistic inference.

TI  - Where is my mind? Examining mind-wandering and vigilance performance.
PG  - 557-571
LID - 10.1007/s00221-018-5438-5 [doi]
AB  - Vigilance is the ability to sustain attention to information for prolonged 
      periods of time, particularly in environments where critical signals may be rare. 
      Recent research in the domain of mind-wandering has suggested that processes 
      associated with mind-wandering may underpin the typical decline in vigilance task 
      performance. Current methods for measuring mind-wandering either disrupt vigils 
      by asking probe questions throughout the task, or, require observers to reflect 
      on how much mind-wandering occurred during the task upon conclusion of the vigil. 
      Across three experimental studies, we treat mind-wandering as an individual 
      difference, which was measured pre- and post-vigil. We argue this technique is a 
      more holistic representation of mind-wandering and is less intrusive than probe 
      measures, which serve to disrupt the vigil. The results of our first experiment 
      challenge previous results in the literature: higher rates of mind-wandering were 
      associated with improved correct detection performance. Interestingly, the second 
      experiment suggests that increases in mind-wandering were not linked to vigilance 
      performance deficits. However, significant differences in global workload emerged 
      in the second experiment, implying individuals low in mind-wandering report 
      greater workload. In a third experiment, wherein we manipulated event rate, 
      mind-wandering typology had no significant effect on vigilance performance. We 
      conclude with a discussion of the relevance of individual differences in 
      mind-wandering in vigilance research considering the present findings.

AB  - Accurate deception detection is a desirable goal with many applications including 
      credibility assessment, security screening, counter-terrorism, and homeland 
      security. However, many deception detection methodologies involve intrusive 
      sensors or other limitations that preclude their use in a covert manner. 
      Posturography may overcome these limitations by using minimally invasive force 
      platform technology. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that posturography 
      would reveal deception-related increases in postural rigidity similar to those 
      observed with previous methodologies. Participants were randomly assigned to a 
      control (CG) or experimental group (EG), and interviewed about the contents of a 
      backpack in their possession while standing on a force platform. EG participants 
      were asked to conceal the presence of several "prohibited" items in the backpack 
      from the interviewer. Center of pressure (COP) measures from the force platform 
      were used to characterize postural sway during participants' verbal responses. We 
      observed a significant deception-related increase in sway frequency, an effect 
      primarily occurring during longer responses that is likely related to increased 
      cognitive load. These findings suggest deception-related increases in postural 
      rigidity as reported in previous work, and demonstrate the feasibility of using 
      posturography as a deception detection tool.

AB  - We investigated the preparation of a spoken answer response to interrogative 
      sentences by measuring response time (RT) and the response-related readiness 
      potential (RP). By comparing the RT and RP results we aimed to identify whether 
      the RP-onset is more related to the actual speech preparation process or the pure 
      intention to speak after turn-anticipation. Additionally, we investigated if the 
      RP-onset can be influenced by the syntactic structure (one or two completion 
      points). Therefore, the EEG data were sorted based on two variables: the 
      cognitive load required for the response and the syntactic structure of the 
      stimulus questions. The results of the response utterance preparation associated 
      event-related potential (ERP) and the RT suggest that the RP-onset is more 
      related to the actual speech preparation process rather than the pure intention 
      to speak after turn-anticipation. However, the RP-onset can be influenced by the 
      syntactic structure of the question leading to an early response preparation.

AB  - Fatigue induced by sustained cognitive demands often entails decreased 
      behavioural performance and the unavailability of brain resources, either due to 
      reduced levels or impaired access. In the present study, we investigated the 
      neural dynamics underlying preserved behavioural performance after inducing 
      cognitive fatigue (CF) in a sleep deprivation (SD) condition in which resources 
      are naturally compromised. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), 
      we recorded cortical brain activity during task-related CF induction in the 
      evening, in the middle of the night and early in the morning. Although cortical 
      oxygenation similarly increased over the 3 sessions, decreased intra-hemispheric 
      connectivity between left anterior frontal and frontal areas paralleled a sudden 
      drop in task performance in the early morning. Our data indicate that decreased 
      sustained attention after the induction of cognitive fatigue in a situation of 
      high sleep pressure results from impaired connectivity between left prefrontal 
      cortical areas rather than from a mere modulation in brain resources.

AB  - AIMS: Following the introduction of the triage test in cervical screening, which 
      was designed to identify a subgroup who were at risk of underlying high-grade 
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), there has been a significant change in 
      the number and profile of cervical biopsies. In this study, analysis of the 
      progressive change in diagnostic categories has been performed to identify the 
      impact of the triage test on the service. METHODS: Cases referred for colposcopy, 
      with corresponding subsequent tissue diagnoses, were identified by electronic 
      search of the histopathology accession database using suitable coding terms for 
      the period between October and April of four consecutive years. A likelihood 
      ratio test was devised to assess the significance of the observed progressive 
      increase in total numbers of cervical biopsies. RESULTS: As anticipated from the 
      pilot studies, implementation of the new guidelines led to a significant increase 
      in the number of women referred for colposcopy. However, the annual increase was 
      greater than expected. During this period, there was a change in the profile of 
      histological diagnoses, characterised by: conspicuous rise in the number of 
      cervical biopsies reported as 'human papillomavirus change only' or 'CIN1' 
      (21-29% and 12-21%, of the total cervical biopsies, respectively); fall in mean 
      CIN scores. CONCLUSIONS: The change in guidelines has led to an increase in 
      patients referred for colposcopy; in turn this has led to an increase in number 
      of specimens (particularly those with lower grades of dysplasia) submitted for 
      histological assessment. This change of workload profile has implications for 
      resourcing services for colposcopy and histopathology.

AB  - Teleoperation under human guidance has become an effective solution to extend 
      human's reach in various environments. However, the teleoperation system still 
      faces challenges of insufficient sense of both visual and haptic feedback from 
      remote environments, which results in the inadequate guidance for the operator. 
      In this paper, a visual/haptic integrated perception and reconstruction system 
      (VHI-PRS) is developed to provide the operator with 3D visual information and 
      effective haptic guidance. Specifically, a visual-based telepresence augmentation 
      method is proposed to provide the operator with virtual-reality combined visual 
      telepresence, where the real point cloud model is directly superimposed on 
      virtual manipulator to avoid the time-consuming process of mesh model rendering. 
      With the utilization of visual information, a haptic-based telepresence 
      augmentation method is proposed to provide the operator with comprehensive force 
      feedback, including the virtual guiding force, virtual repulsive force and 
      real-time interactive force, which greatly helps reduce the workload of operator. 
      Finally, a user study on grab-place task is carried out to verify the 
      effectiveness of proposed system.

AB  - Industrial companies indicate a tendency to eliminate variations in operator 
      strategies, particularly following implementation of the lean principle. 
      Companies believe when the operators perform the same prescribed tasks, they have 
      to execute them in the same manner (completing the same gestures and being 
      exposed to the same risk factors). They attempt to achieve better product quality 
      by standardizing and reducing operational leeway. However, operators adjust and 
      modify ways of performing tasks to balance between their abilities and the 
      requirements of the job. This study aims to investigate the variability of 
      exposure to physical risk factors within and between operators when executing the 
      same prescribed tasks. The Ergonomic Standard method was used to evaluate two 
      workstations. Seven operators were observed thirty times between repeated cycle 
      times at those workstations. The results revealed the variability of exposure to 
      risk factors between and within operators in the repeated execution of the same 
      tasks. Individual characteristics and operators' strategies might generate the 
      variability of exposure to risk factors that may be an opportunity to reduce the 
      risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WR-MSDs). However, sometimes 
      operators' strategies may cause overexposure to risk factors; operators most 
      often adopt such strategies to undertake their tasks while reducing the workload.

TI  - Nurse absenteeism: An analysis of trends and perceptions of nurse unit managers.
PG  - 109-116
LID - 10.1111/jonm.12654 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore absenteeism trends and absenteeism management from the 
      perspective of nurse unit managers. BACKGROUND: Unscheduled absenteeism among 
      nurses appears to be a multi-factorial phenomenon and is a source of concern due 
      to the effect absenteeism has on the daily management of human resources, 
      ultimately affecting delivery of safe care. Identifying absenteeism trends among 
      nurses may inform the development of targeted strategies to minimize unscheduled 
      absenteeism. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used with the quantitative 
      phase retrospectively reviewing and analysing nurse absenteeism data, whilst the 
      qualitative phase involved semi-structured interviews with nurse unit managers, 
      exploring their perceptions pertaining to the absenteeism trends. RESULTS: Data 
      analysis revealed that absenteeism in hospitals follows various trends, amongst 
      them seasonal, daily, and demographic trends. A heavy workload, which takes its 
      toll on the nurses' physical and mental health, also contributes to nurse 
      absenteeism. CONCLUSION: This study reveals absenteeism trends from nurse 
      managers' perspectives, with authentication from official statistics. Any 
      prescriptive measures for absenteeism should take into account absenteeism trend 
      analysis and the work environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: An 
      analysis of absenteeism trends will assist management in initiating tailor-made 
      intervention measures.

PG  - 3028-3036
LID - 10.1167/iovs.17-23627 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A shortage of human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC) for transplant and 
      current methods of differentiation induction require chemical compounds, which 
      might cast further influences after differentiation induction. Therefore, we 
      developed a simple and straightforward approach to endothelial cell 
      differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESC). METHODS: HESC are used to 
      differentiate into HCEC by employing a two-stage method, which involves the 
      application of two different types of conditioned culture medium, human corneal 
      stromal cell-conditioned medium (HCSC-CM) and lens epithelial cell (LEC) plus 
      HCSC-CM (LEC-CM+HCEC-CM). In brief, hESCs were treated with different conditioned 
      media to induce directed endothelial differentiation. RESULTS: In the presence of 
      conditioned culture medium, embryonic stem cells differentiate first under the 
      control of periocular mesenchymal precursors (POMPs). Consequently, the 
      expression of several POMP markers was observed. Following this first stage 
      differentiation, POMPs were further directed to differentiate into corneal 
      endothelial cell (CEC)-like cells in the presence of the second-conditioned 
      culture medium. The differentiation of POMPs into CEC-like cells is regulated by 
      a TGFÎ²-2/FOXC1 signaling pathway that is activated by the factors present in the 
      conditioned culture medium. CONCLUSIONS: HCEC-like cells could be differentiated 
      from hESC by simply using a two-step, preconditioned, medium-mediated approach, 
      which could significantly minimize the workload to generate HCEC for potential 
      clinical use. This research may provide an ideal cell source for corneal 
      regenerative medicine and clinical treatment for corneal diseases in the future.

TI  - Enhanced Muscle Activation Using Robotic Assistance Within the Electromechanical 
      Delay: Implications for Rehabilitation?
PG  - 2432-2440
LID - 10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3419688 [doi]
AB  - Robotic rehabilitation has been shown to match the effects of conventional 
      physical therapy on motor function for patients with neurological diseases. 
      Rehabilitation robots have the potential to reduce therapists' workload in 
      time-intensive training programs as well as perform actions that are not 
      replicable by human therapists. We investigated the effects of one such modality 
      that cannot be achieved by a human therapist: assistance and resistance within 
      the electromechanical delay between muscle activation and muscle contraction 
      during arm extension. We found increased muscle activation when providing robotic 
      assistance within this electromechanical delay. Assistance provided within this 
      delay moves the participant's arm quicker than their own muscle and increases the 
      subsequent peak voluntary muscle activation compared to normal arm extension by 
      68.97 Â± 80.05 % (SE = 0.021; p = 0.007 ). This is surprising since all previous 
      literature shows that muscle activation either decreases or does not change when 
      participants receive robotic assistance. As a consequence, traditional robotic 
      rehabilitation incrementally reduces assistance as the patient improves to 
      maintain levels of muscle activation which is suggested to be important for 
      neuronal repair. The present result may enable therapists to no longer have to 
      choose between providing assistance or increasing muscle activation. Instead, 
      therapists may be able to provide assistance while also increasing muscle 
      activation.

TI  - The Human Medial Temporal Lobe Is Necessary for Remembering Durations within a 
      Sequence of Events but Not Durations of Individual Events.
PG  - 497-507
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_01489 [doi]
AB  - Recent interest in the role of the hippocampus in temporal aspects of cognition 
      has been fueled, in part, by the observation of "time" cells in the rodent 
      hippocampus-that is, cells that have differential firing patterns depending on 
      how long ago an event occurred. Such cells are thought to provide an internal 
      representation of elapsed time. Yet, the hippocampus is not needed for processing 
      temporal duration information per se, at least on the order of seconds, as 
      evidenced by intact duration judgments in rodents and humans with hippocampal 
      damage. Rather, it has been proposed that the hippocampus may be essential for 
      coding higher order aspects of temporal mnemonic processing, such as those needed 
      to temporally organize a sequence of events that form an episode. To examine 
      whether (1) the hippocampus uses duration information in the service of 
      establishing temporal relations among events and (2) its role in memory for 
      duration is unique to sequences, we tested amnesic patients with medial-temporal 
      lobe damage (including the hippocampus). We hypothesized that medial-temporal 
      lobe damage should impair the ability to remember sequential duration information 
      but leave intact judgments about duration devoid of a sequential demand. We found 
      that amnesics were impaired in making judgments about durations within a sequence 
      but not in judging single durations. This impairment was not due to higher 
      cognitive load associated with duration judgments about sequences. In convergence 
      with rodent and human fMRI work, these findings shed light on how time coding in 
      the hippocampus may contribute to temporal cognition.

AB  - It remains unknown whether cutaneous adrenergic nerves functionally contribute to 
      sweat production during exercise. This study examined whether cutaneous 
      adrenergic nerve blockade attenuates sweating during incremental exercise, 
      specifically in habitually trained individuals. Accordingly, 10 habitually 
      trained and 10 untrained males (VÌo(2max): 56.7âÂ±â5.4 and 38.9âÂ±â6.7 
      mlÂ·kg(-1)Â·min(-1), respectively; Pâ< 0.001) performed incremental semirecumbent 
      cycling (20 W/min) until exhaustion. Sweat rates (ventilated capsule) were 
      measured at two bilateral forearm skin sites on which either 10 mM bretylium 
      tosylate (BT) (an inhibitor of neurotransmitter release from sympathetic 
      adrenergic nerve terminals) or saline (Control) was transdermally administered 
      via iontophoresis. BT treatment delayed sweating onset in both groups (â¼0.66 min; 
      P = 0.001) and suppressed the sweat rate relative to the Control treatment at 
      â¥70% relative total exercise time in trained individuals (each 10% increment; all 
      P â¤ 0.009) but not in untrained counterparts ( P = 0.122, interaction between 
      relative timeâÃâtreatment). Changes in total sweat production at the BT site 
      relative to the Control site were greater in trained individuals than in 
      untrained counterparts (area under the curve, -0.86âÂ±â0.67 and -0.22âÂ±â0.39 
      mg/cm(2), respectively; P = 0.023). In conclusion, we demonstrated that cutaneous 
      adrenergic nerves do modulate sweating during incremental exercise, which 
      appeared to be more apparent in habitually trained men (e.g., â¥70% maximum 
      workload). Although our results indicated that habitual exercise training may 
      augment neural adrenergic sweat production during incremental exercise, 
      additional studies are required to confirm this possibility. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We 
      demonstrated for the first time that cutaneous adrenergic nerves do modulate 
      sweating during high-intensity exercise in humans (â¥70% maximum workload). In 
      addition, neural adrenergic sweating appeared to be greater in habitually trained 
      individuals than in untrained counterparts, although further studies are 
      necessary to confirm such a possibility. Nonetheless, the observations presented 
      herein advance our understanding on human thermoregulation while providing new 
      evidence for the neutral mediation of adrenergic sweating during exercise.

AB  - l-Tyrosine (TYR), the precursor of dopamine (DA), has been shown to enhance 
      facets of cognitive control in situations with high cognitive demands. However 
      some previous outcomes were mixed: some studies reported significant 
      improvements, while other did not. Given that TYR increases DA level in the 
      brain, we investigated, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, 
      whether the C957T genotypes of a functional synonymous polymorphism in the human 
      dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene (rs6277) contribute to individual differences in 
      the reactivity to TYR administration and whether this factor predicts the 
      magnitude of TYR-induced performance differences on inhibiting behavioral 
      responses in a stop-signal task and working memory (WM) updating in a N-back 
      task. Our findings show that T/T homozygotes (i.e., individuals potentially 
      associated with lower striatal DA level) showed larger beneficial effects of TYR 
      supplementation than C/C homozygotes (i.e., individuals potentially associated 
      with higher striatal DA level), suggesting that genetically determined 
      differences in DA function may explain inter-individual differences in response 
      to TYR supplementation. These findings reinforce the idea that genetic 
      predisposition modulates the effect of TYR in its role as cognitive enhancer.

TI  - The effect of repetition priming on spatial memory during backtracking in a novel 
      environment.
PG  - 319-22
LID - 10.1007/s10339-015-0668-y [doi]
AB  - During wayfinding in a novel environment, we encounter many new places. Some of 
      those places are encoded by our spatial memory. But how does the human brain 
      "decides" which locations are more important than others, and how do backtracking 
      and repetition priming enhances memorization of these scenes? In this work, we 
      explore how backtracking improves encoding of encountered locations. We also 
      check whether repetition priming helps with further memory enhancement. We 
      recruited 20 adults. Each participant was guided through an unfamiliar indoor 
      environment. The participants were instructed to remember the path, as they would 
      need to backtrack by themselves. Two groups were defined: the first group 
      performed a spatial memory test at the goal destination and after backtracking; 
      the second group performed the test only after backtracking. The mean spatial 
      memory scores of the first group improved significantly after backtracking: from 
      49.8 to 60.8%. The score of the second group was 62%. No difference was found in 
      performance between the first group and the second group. Backtracking alone 
      significantly improves spatial memory of visited places. Surprisingly, repetition 
      priming does not further enhance memorization of these places. This result may 
      suggest that spatial reasoning causes significant cognitive load that thwarts 
      further improvement of spatial memory of locations.

AB  - Customization is assumed to reduce error and increase user acceptance in the 
      human-machine relation. Reconfiguration gives the operator the option to 
      customize a user interface according to his or her own preferences. An 
      experimental study with 72 computer science students using a simulated process 
      control task was conducted. The reconfiguration group (RG) interactively 
      reconfigured their user interfaces and used the reconfigured user interface in 
      the subsequent test whereas the control group (CG) used a default user interface. 
      Results showed significantly lower error rates and higher acceptance of the RG 
      compared to the CG while there were no significant differences between the groups 
      regarding situation awareness and mental workload. Reconfiguration seems to be 
      promising and therefore warrants further exploration.

TI  - Altered Energetics of Exercise Explain Risk of Rhabdomyolysis in Very Long-Chain 
      Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency.

AB  - Rhabdomyolysis is common in very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency 
      (VLCADD) and other metabolic myopathies, but its pathogenic basis is poorly 
      understood. Here, we show that prolonged bicycling exercise against a 
      standardized moderate workload in VLCADD patients is associated with threefold 
      bigger changes in phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) 
      concentrations in quadriceps muscle and twofold lower changes in plasma 
      acetyl-carnitine levels than in healthy subjects. This result is consistent with 
      the hypothesis that muscle ATP homeostasis during exercise is compromised in 
      VLCADD. However, the measured rates of PCr and Pi recovery post-exercise showed 
      that the mitochondrial capacity for ATP synthesis in VLCADD muscle was normal. 
      Mathematical modeling of oxidative ATP metabolism in muscle composed of three 
      different fiber types indicated that the observed altered energy balance during 
      submaximal exercise in VLCADD patients may be explained by a slow-to-fast shift 
      in quadriceps fiber-type composition corresponding to 30% of the slow-twitch 
      fiber-type pool in healthy quadriceps muscle. This study demonstrates for the 
      first time that quadriceps energy balance during exercise in VLCADD patients is 
      altered but not because of failing mitochondrial function. Our findings provide 
      new clues to understanding the risk of rhabdomyolysis following exercise in human 
      VLCADD.

TI  - Visual tools to assess the plausibility of algorithm-identified infectious 
      disease clusters: an application to mumps data from the Netherlands dating from 
      January 2009 to June 2016.

AB  - IntroductionWith growing amounts of data available, identification of clusters of 
      persons linked to each other by transmission of an infectious disease 
      increasingly relies on automated algorithms. We propose cluster finding to be a 
      two-step process: first, possible transmission clusters are identified using a 
      cluster algorithm, second, the plausibility that the identified clusters 
      represent genuine transmission clusters is evaluated.AimTo introduce visual tools 
      to assess automatically identified clusters.MethodsWe developed tools to 
      visualise: (i) clusters found in dimensions of time, geographical location and 
      genetic data; (ii) nested sub-clusters within identified clusters; (iii) 
      intra-cluster pairwise dissimilarities per dimension; (iv) intra-cluster 
      correlation between dimensions. We applied our tools to notified mumps cases in 
      the Netherlands with available disease onset date (January 2009 - June 2016), 
      geographical information (location of residence), and pathogen sequence data 
      (nâ=â112). We compared identified clusters to clusters reported by the 
      Netherlands Early Warning Committee (NEWC).ResultsWe identified five mumps 
      clusters. Three clusters were considered plausible. One was questionable because, 
      in phylogenetic analysis, genetic sequences related to it segregated in two 
      groups. One was implausible with no smaller nested clusters, high intra-cluster 
      dissimilarities on all dimensions, and low intra-cluster correlation between 
      dimensions. The NEWC reports concurred with our findings: the 
      plausible/questionable clusters corresponded to reported outbreaks; the 
      implausible cluster did not.ConclusionOur tools for assessing automatically 
      identified clusters allow outbreak investigators to rapidly spot plausible 
      transmission clusters for mumps and other human-to-human transmissible diseases. 
      This fast information processing potentially reduces workload.

      burnout as predictors of patient safety: A structural equation modeling analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Promotion of patient safety is among the most important goals and 
      challenges of healthcare systems worldwide in countries including China. 
      Donabedian's Structure-Process-Outcome model implies that patient safety is 
      affected by hospital nursing organizational factors and nursing care process. 
      However, studies are imperative for a clear understanding about the mechanisms by 
      which patient safety is affected to guide practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of 
      this study was to explore the impact of hospital nursing work environment, 
      workload, nursing care left undone, and nurse burnout on patient safety. DESIGN: 
      This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 23 hospitals in Guangdong province, 
      China in 2014. Data from nurses (nâ¯=â¯1542) responsible for direct care on 111 
      randomly sampled medical and surgical units were analyzed. METHODS: Work 
      environment was measured by the Practice Environment Scale of Nursing Work Index. 
      Workload was measured by day shift unit patient-nurse ratio and non-professional 
      tasks conducted by nurses. Nursing care left undone was measured by 12 items 
      addressing necessary nursing activities. Nurse burnout was measured by the 
      emotional exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services 
      Survey. Patient safety was measured by three items indicating nurses' perception 
      of overall patient safety and nine items addressing patient adverse events. 
      Structural equation modeling was used to examine a hypothesized model that 
      supposed work environment and workload have both direct and indirect effects on 
      patient safety through nursing care left undone and nurse burnout. RESULTS: The 
      findings generally supported the hypothesized model. Better work environment was 
      associated with better patient safety both directly and indirectly. Lower 
      workload primarily indirectly related to better patient safety. Nursing care left 
      undone and nurse burnout were mediators negatively associated with patient 
      safety. CONCLUSIONS: Improving work environment, increasing nurse staffing 
      levels, and providing sufficient support for nurses to spend more time on direct 
      patient care would be beneficial to patient safety improvement.

AB  - Game controllers are emerging as a preferred choice for the manual control of 
      unmanned vehicles, but an understanding of their usability characteristics has 
      yet to emerge. We compared the usability of an Xbox 360 game controller in a dual 
      task situation using MATB II to the traditional joystick and keyboard interface 
      in two experiments. In the first experiment, performance with the game controller 
      was associated with fewer tracking errors. In a second experiment, we trained 
      users on the devices, and found that even after training the game controller was 
      still associated with fewer tracking errors as well as higher usability and lower 
      workload ratings. These results are consistent with the idea that game 
      controllers are highly usable input devices and do not require high mental 
      workload to operate, thus making them suitable for complex control tasks.

TI  - Sleep Quality of Call Handlers Employed in International Call Centers in National 
      Capital Region of Delhi, India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Call center sector in India is a relatively new and fast growing 
      industry driving employment and growth in modern India today. Most international 
      call centers in National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi operate at odd work hours 
      corresponding to a time suitable fortheir international customers. The sleep 
      quality of call handlers employed in these call centers is in jeopardy owing to 
      their altered sleep schedule. OBJECTIVE: To assess the sleep quality and 
      determine its independent predictors among call handlers employed in 
      international call centers in NCR of Delhi. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      questionnaire-based study was conducted on 375 call handlers aged 18-39 years 
      employed in international call centers in NCR of Delhi. Sleep quality 
      was assessed using Athens Insomnia scale along with a pre-tested, structured 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 24.6 (SD 2.4) years. 78% 
      of participants were male. 83.5% of respondents were unmarried. 44.3% of call 
      handlers were cigarette smokers. Physical ailments were reported by 37% call 
      handlers. 77.6% of call handlers had somesuspicion of insomnia or suspected 
      insomnia; the rest had no sleep problem. Smoking, poor social support, heavy 
      workload, lack of relaxation facility at office, and prolonged travel time to 
      office were independent predictors of sleep quality (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Call 
      handlers have to compromise upon their sleep owing to the contemporary work 
      settings in call centers. Safeguarding their health becomes an occupational 
      health challenge to public health specialists.

PG  - 4749-52
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319455 [doi]
AB  - EEG-based workload estimation technology provides a real time means of assessing 
      mental workload. Such technology can effectively enhance the performance of the 
      human-machine interaction and the learning process. When designing workload 
      estimation algorithms, a crucial signal processing component is the feature 
      extraction step. Despite several studies on this field, the spatial properties of 
      the EEG signals were mostly neglected. Since EEG inherently has a poor spacial 
      resolution, features extracted individually from each EEG channel may not be 
      sufficiently efficient. This problem becomes more pronounced when we use low-cost 
      but convenient EEG sensors with limited stability which is the case in practical 
      scenarios. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a filter bank 
      common spatial patterns algorithm combined with a feature selection method to 
      extract spatio-spectral features discriminating different mental workload levels. 
      To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we carry out a comparative analysis between 
      two representative types of working memory tasks using data recorded from an 
      Emotiv EPOC headset which is a mobile low-cost EEG recording device. The 
      experimental results showed that the proposed spatial filtering algorithm 
      outperformed the state-of-the algorithms in terms of the classification accuracy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to propose a new method for optimizing the touch-screen 
      installation position in order to minimize the physical workload and increase 
      screen visibility. Ten students participated in this study. The participants 
      utilized a touch screen at different installation heights (50, 65, and 80% of 
      stature), tilt angles (0Â°, 45Â°, and 90Â° from the horizontal plane), and having 
      different button sizes (a square with a side of 10, 20, and 30â¯mm). The joint 
      angles, when using a touch screen, were measured to calculate the joint torque 
      ratios (JTRs). Subjective screen visibility were also determined. The optimal 
      installation position was determined by solving a bi-objective optimization 
      problem consisting of two objective functions. The Pareto optimal solutions for 
      the two objectives showed a range of 1124-1251â¯mm and 44.4-67.9Â°. The proposed 
      method determined the optimal installation position of the touch screens.

AB  - The Air Traffic Control (ATC) environment is complex and safety-critical. Whilst 
      exchanging information with pilots, controllers must also be alert to visual 
      notifications displayed on the radar screen (e.g., warning which indicates a loss 
      of minimum separation between aircraft). Under the assumption that attentional 
      resources are shared between vision and hearing, the visual interface design may 
      also impact the ability to process these auditory stimuli. Using a simulated ATC 
      task, we compared the behavioral and neural responses to two different visual 
      notification designs--the operational alarm that involves blinking colored "ALRT" 
      displayed around the label of the notified plane ("Color-Blink"), and the more 
      salient alarm involving the same blinking text plus four moving yellow chevrons 
      ("Box-Animation"). Participants performed a concurrent auditory task with the 
      requirement to react to rare pitch tones. P300 from the occurrence of the tones 
      was taken as an indicator of remaining attentional resources. Participants who 
      were presented with the more salient visual design showed better accuracy than 
      the group with the suboptimal operational design. On a physiological level, 
      auditory P300 amplitude in the former group was greater than that observed in the 
      latter group. One potential explanation is that the enhanced visual design freed 
      up attentional resources which, in turn, improved the cerebral processing of the 
      auditory stimuli. These results suggest that P300 amplitude can be used as a 
      valid estimation of the efficiency of interface designs, and of cognitive load 
      more generally.

AB  - Most theories of lie detection assume that lying increases cognitive load, 
      resulting in longer response latencies during questioning. However, the studies 
      supporting this theory are typically laboratory-based, in settings with no 
      specific validity in security contexts. Consequently, using virtual reality (VR), 
      we investigated how response latencies were influenced in an ecologically valid 
      environment of interest to security professionals. In a highly realistic airport 
      security terminal presented in VR, a security officer asked participants yes/no 
      questions about their belongings. We found that liars actually responded more 
      quickly to questions on which they were lying than to questions on which they 
      were telling the truth. A control group, who answered the same questions but were 
      not lying, answered equally quickly for all questions. We argue that this 
      decrease in response time is possibly an unconscious reaction to questions on 
      which individuals must answer deceptively. These results call into question the 
      generalizability of previous research and highlight the importance of ecological 
      validity when researching lie detection. These findings also uncover a new 
      potential tool for enhancing lie detection in real-world scenarios.

TI  - Is Neural Activity Detected by ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces Task Specific?
PG  - e0165556

LID - e0165556
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that are based on event-related 
      potentials (ERPs) can estimate to which stimulus a user pays particular 
      attention. In typical BCIs, the user silently counts the selected stimulus (which 
      is repeatedly presented among other stimuli) in order to focus the attention. The 
      stimulus of interest is then inferred from the electroencephalogram (EEG). 
      Detecting attention allocation implicitly could be also beneficial for 
      human-computer interaction (HCI), because it would allow software to adapt to the 
      user's interest. However, a counting task would be inappropriate for the 
      envisaged implicit application in HCI. Therefore, the question was addressed if 
      the detectable neural activity is specific for silent counting, or if it can be 
      evoked also by other tasks that direct the attention to certain stimuli. 
      APPROACH: Thirteen people performed a silent counting, an arithmetic and a memory 
      task. The tasks required the subjects to pay particular attention to target 
      stimuli of a random color. The stimulus presentation was the same in all three 
      tasks, which allowed a direct comparison of the experimental conditions. RESULTS: 
      Classifiers that were trained to detect the targets in one task, according to 
      patterns present in the EEG signal, could detect targets in all other tasks 
      (irrespective of some task-related differences in the EEG). SIGNIFICANCE: The 
      neural activity detected by the classifiers is not strictly task specific but can 
      be generalized over tasks and is presumably a result of the attention allocation 
      or of the augmented workload. The results may hold promise for the transfer of 
      classification algorithms from BCI research to implicit relevance detection in 
      HCI.

AB  - Conditionally automated driving (CAD) systems are expected to improve traffic 
      safety. Whenever the CAD system exceeds its limit of operation, designers of the 
      system need to ensure a safe and timely enough transition from automated to 
      manual mode. An existing visual Human-Machine Interface (HMI) was supplemented by 
      different auditory outputs. The present work compares the effects of different 
      auditory outputs in form of (1) a generic warning tone and (2) additional 
      semantic speech output on driver behavior for the announcement of an upcoming 
      take-over request (TOR). We expect the information carried by means of speech 
      output to lead to faster reactions and better subjective evaluations by the 
      drivers compared to generic auditory output. To test this assumption, N=17 
      drivers completed two simulator drives, once with a generic warning tone 
      ('Generic') and once with additional speech output ('Speech+generic'), while they 
      were working on a non-driving related task (NDRT; i.e., reading a magazine). Each 
      drive incorporated one transition from automated to manual mode when yellow 
      secondary lanes emerged. Different reaction time measures, relevant for the 
      take-over process, were assessed. Furthermore, drivers evaluated the complete HMI 
      regarding usefulness, ease of use and perceived visual workload just after 
      experiencing the take-over. They gave comparative ratings on usability and 
      acceptance at the end of the experiment. Results revealed that reaction times, 
      reflecting information processing time (i.e., hands on the steering wheel, 
      termination of NDRT), were shorter for 'Speech+generic' compared to 'Generic' 
      while reaction time, reflecting allocation of attention (i.e., first glance 
      ahead), did not show this difference. Subjective ratings were in favor of the 
      system with additional speech output.

PG  - 629-35
LID - 10.1177/1553350615573582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessing the workload of surgeons requires technology to 
      continuously monitor surgeons' behaviors without interfering with their 
      performance. We investigated the feasibility of using eye-tracking to reveal 
      surgeons' response to increasing task difficulty. METHODS: A controlled study was 
      conducted in a simulated operating room, where 14 subjects were required to 
      perform a laparoscopic procedure that includes 9 subtasks. The subtasks could be 
      divided into 3 types with different levels of task difficulty, calculated by the 
      index of task difficulty (ID) proposed by Fitts in 1954. Pupillary responses of 
      subjects in performing the procedure were recorded using Tobii eye-tracking 
      equipment. Peak pupil dilation and movement time were compared between subtasks 
      with different IDs as well as between fast moving and slow aiming phases within 
      each subtask. RESULTS: When the task difficulty was increased, task completion 
      time increased. Meanwhile, the subjects' peak pupil size also increased. As the 
      entire procedure was performed continuously, we found that pupil responses were 
      not only affected by the ID in the current subtask but also influenced by 
      subtasks before and after. DISCUSSION: Decomposing a surgical procedure into 
      meaningful subtasks and examining the surgeon's pupil response to each subtask 
      enables us to identify the challenging steps within a continuous surgical 
      procedure. Psychomotor evidence on surgeon's performance may lead to an 
      innovation for designing a task-specific training curriculum.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to assess if improvement of the 
      learner experience could be achieved through the use of instructional design 
      strategies in current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) training. This is a 
      novel application in a topic that is known to be boring but is critical to 
      ensuring patient safety. METHODS: An experimental randomized controlled repeated 
      measures cross-over design was utilized in a sample of pharmacy students to 
      determine the effect of an intervention training strategy (which utilized a mix 
      of strategies including weeding, signaling, use of multimedia, and optimized 
      space and type) on the learner experience (Evaluation, Overall Satisfaction, 
      Perceived Knowledge, and Future Recommendation) compared with a control. RESULTS: 
      The sample of 52 pharmacy students that participated evaluated the intervention 
      training strategy with higher scores than the control, with better overall 
      satisfaction, perceived knowledge, and future recommendation scores than the 
      control training strategy. Thus, an apparent effect which resulted from the use 
      of instructional design strategies was seen for all learner experience variables 
      (p < .01). CONCLUSION: Improvement in the learner experience can be achieved by 
      using instructional design strategies in cGMP training. This indicates that 
      similar results could be obtained in other topics where such techniques have not 
      yet been applied.

AB  - Few studies have focused on adverse relations of job strain to health in disabled 
      employees by gender. In this study, the author explores gender differences in 
      work-related stress, social support, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
      among 106 disabled employees in an electronics manufacturing plant during 
      2012-2013, using questionnaire data on demographics, perceived work-related 
      stress, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Chinese version of the Job Content 
      Questionnaire (C-JCQ), and HRQoL. The prevalence of stress related to workload, 
      colleagues, and supervisor were 26.4%, 14.1%, and 8.5%, respectively. Disabled 
      females had higher scores for psychological job demand than male disabled 
      employees (p = .0219). Increasing psychological job demand scores were adversely 
      related to physical function scores (Î² = -1.6) in males, whereas increasing 
      decision latitude scores were positively related to role-limitation due to 
      physical function (Î² = 2.3), general health (Î² = 1.2), vitality (Î² = 1.3), 
      role-limitation due to emotional health (Î² = 2.6), and mental health (Î² = 0.9) 
      scores in females. These results provide a better understanding of the HRQoL in 
      female and male disabled workers, allowing for the development of 
      stress-prevention programs specific for gender in disabled laborers.

TI  - Effects of upper-limb exoskeleton on muscle activity in tasks requiring arm 
      elevation: Part II - In-field experiments in construction industry settings.
PG  - 753-763
LID - 10.3233/WOR-230218 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The body of literature regarding the use of an upper limb exoskeleton 
      during authentic working conditions is sparse. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the effectiveness of an upper limb exoskeleton in reducing muscle 
      strain during authentic industrial construction work. METHODS: Fifteen male 
      participants, comprising of roofers, scaffolders, builders, bricklayers, and 
      graders performing overhead work participated in the study. During work without 
      (REF) and with exoskeleton (EXO), muscle activity from 8 muscles, heart rate 
      (HR), metabolic equivalent (MET), and upper arm elevation angles were recorded. 
      RESULTS: When using the exoskeleton, a significant reduction of 20.2% in average 
      muscle activity of 8 muscles was found. The largest effect focused on m. 
      deltoideus, where 46.2 and 32.2% reduction occurred in medial and anterior parts 
      of the muscle, respectively. HR and MET were unaffected. Upper arm elevation 
      angles were similar between REF and EXO, indicating equal biomechanical loading. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that exoskeletons show great promise in 
      reducing the potential for musculoskeletal strain during authentic overhead 
      construction work.

AB  - Rhythmical brain activity in the range between four and eight Hz acquired over 
      frontal-midline EEG recording sites - so called frontal-midline theta activity - 
      is regarded as one of the most prominent neural signatures of sustained 
      attention. It is reported to parametrically increase with cognitive load and is 
      thought to be generated in medial prefrontal cortex. Here we explored the 
      possibility of using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over frontal 
      sites to enhance frontal-midline theta activity and to increase sustained 
      attention performance. We used a small preliminary sample to test a novel direct 
      current stimulation electrode configuration by which we were able to 
      significantly increase frontal-midline theta amplitude in a resting condition 
      after the end of the stimulation period. Using standardised low resolution 
      electromagnetic tomography analysis the effect in the surface EEG was localised 
      to right prefrontal and left medial prefrontal brain areas. Transcranial direct 
      current stimulation did, however, not have any impact on behavioural performance 
      during a sustained attention task. This most likely was due to a very fast 
      washout of the stimulation's after effect on theta activity. Although these are 
      only preliminary results from a rather small sample, this study demonstrates that

AB  - The aim of this laboratory experiment was to study the effects of ventilation 
      rate, and related changes in air quality, predominantly bioeffluents, on work 
      performance, perceived indoor air quality, and health symptoms in a typical 
      conditions of modern open-plan office with low material and equipment emissions. 
      In Condition A, outdoor air flow rate of 28.2 l/s person (CO(2) level 540 ppm) 
      was applied and in Condition B, outdoor air flow rate was 2.3 l/s person (CO(2) 
      level 2260 ppm). CO(2) concentration level was used as an indicator of 
      bioeffluents. Performance was measured with seven different tasks which measure 
      different cognitive processes. Thirty-six subjects participated in the 
      experiment. The exposure time was 4 hours. Condition B had a weak negative effect 
      on performance only in the information retrieval tasks. Condition B increased 
      slightly subjective workload and perceived fatigue. No effects on health symptoms 
      were found. The intensity of symptoms was low in both conditions. The 
      experimental condition had an effect on perceived air quality and observed odor 
      intensity only in the beginning of the session. Although the room temperature was 
      controlled in both conditions, the heat was perceived to impair the performance 
      more in Condition B.

AB  - Human experimentation investigating the contribution of limb movement frequency 
      in determining the fast exercise drive to breathe has produced controversial 
      findings. To evaluate the role of limb movement frequency in determining the fast 
      exercise drive to breathe, endurance runners and recreationally-active controls 
      performed two sinusoidal exercise protocols on a cycle ergometer. One protocol 
      was performed at constant workload with sinusoidal pedaling cadence, and a second 
      with sinusoidal workload at constant cadence. Metabolic rate (VO2) increases and 
      means were matched between these two experiments. The ventilatory response was 
      significantly faster when limb movement speed was varied, compared to when pedal 
      loading was varied (18.49 Â± 15.6s vs. 50.5 Â± 14.5s, p<0.05). Ventilation response 
      amplitudes were significantly higher during pedal cadence variation versus pedal 
      loading variation (3.99 Â± 0.25 vs. 2.58 Â± 0.17 L/min, p<0.05). Similar findings 
      were obtained for endurance athletes, with significantly attenuated ventilation 
      responses to exercise versus control subjects. We conclude that fast changes in 
      limb movement frequency are a potent stimulus for ventilation at submaximal 
      workloads, and that this response is susceptible to attenuation through training.

TI  - Continuous Stress Detection Using Wearable Sensors in Real Life: Algorithmic 
      Programming Contest Case Study.

LID - 1849
AB  - The negative effects of mental stress on human health has been known for decades. 
      High-level stress must be detected at early stages to prevent these negative 
      effects. After the emergence of wearable devices that could be part of our lives, 
      researchers have started detecting extreme stress of individuals with them during 
      daily routines. Initial experiments were performed in laboratory environments and 
      recently a number of works took a step outside the laboratory environment to the 
      real-life. We developed an automatic stress detection system using physiological 
      signals obtained from unobtrusive smart wearable devices which can be carried 
      during the daily life routines of individuals. This system has modality-specific 
      artifact removal and feature extraction methods for real-life conditions. We 
      further tested our system in a real-life setting with collected physiological 
      data from 21 participants of an algorithmic programming contest for nine days. 
      This event had lectures, contests as well as free time. By using heart activity, 
      skin conductance and accelerometer signals, we successfully discriminated contest 
      stress, relatively higher cognitive load (lecture) and relaxed time activities by 
      using different machine learning methods.

TI  - Intracorporeal suturing: Transfer from Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery to 
      cadavers results in substantial increase in mental workload.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A spatial secondary task developed by the authors was used to 
      measure the mental workload of the participant when transferring suturing skills 
      from a box simulator to more realistic surgical conditions using a fresh cadaver. 
      We hypothesized that laparoscopic suturing on genuine bowel would be more 
      challenging than on the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS)-simulated 
      bowel as reflected in differences on both suturing and secondary task scores. 
      METHODS: We trained 14 surgical assistant students to FLS proficiency in 
      intracorporeal suturing. Participants practiced suturing on the FLS box for 30 
      minutes and then were tested on both the FLS box and the bowel of a fresh cadaver 
      using the spatial, secondary dual-task conditions developed by the authors. 
      RESULTS: Suturing times increased by >333% when moving from the FLS platform to 
      the cadaver F(1,13) = 44.04, P < .001. The increased completion times were 
      accompanied by a 70% decrease in secondary task scores, F(1,13) = 21.21, P < 
      .001. CONCLUSION: The mental workload associated with intracorporeal suturing 
      increases dramatically when trainees transfer from the FLS platform to human 
      tissue under more realistic conditions of suturing. The increase in mental 
      workload is indexed by both an increase in suturing times and a decrease in the 
      ability to attend to the secondary task.

TI  - Reflex Repeat HER2 Testing of Grade 3 Breast Carcinoma at Excision Using 
      Immunohistochemistry and In Situ Analysis: Frequency of HER2 Discordance and 
      Utility of Core Needle Biopsy Parameters to Refine Case Selection.
PG  - 75-80
LID - 10.1093/ajcp/aqv018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The updated American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American 
      Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines (2013) for human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer recommend repeat testing at excision 
      of HER2-negative grade 3 breast tumors. This study aimed to identify the rate of 
      HER2 discordance in this cohort of cases. METHODS: All HER2-negative grade 3 
      tumors diagnosed at a single institution over a 15-month period had reflex repeat 
      HER2 testing at excision : HER2 testing was performed in accordance with ASCO/CAP 
      guidelines using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and dual in situ hybridization (ISH). 
      RESULTS: One hundred cases were identified over the study period. HER2 was 
      amplified at excision in three cases. The discordant tumors showed equivocal IHC 
      at excision with low-level amplification on dual ISH. All discordant cases showed 
      equivocal IHC on core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens and/or tumor upgrade at 
      excision. CONCLUSIONS: Our series demonstrated a high concordance rate (97%) for 
      HER2 at excision in grade 3 breast tumors with a negative core biopsy result. 
      These findings suggest that reflex repeat HER2 testing of all these cases, which 
      has significant cost and workload implications, may not be justified. Features 
      that may indicate HER2 heterogeneity, such as equivocal IHC on CNB specimens or 
      tumor upgrade at excision, may help refine selection of cases for repeat testing.

TI  - Assessment of energy balance against the nutritional status of women carriers in 
      the brickfields of West Bengal.

AB  - The Indian brick industry is an unorganized sector in which large numbers of 
      migrant women workers are employed. A survey was conducted on 62 women workers 
      working in different brickfields of West Bengal to assess their physiological 
      workload, nutritional profile, total energy expenditure and energy balance. 
      Energy intake was calculated using physiological fuel values of carbohydrate, fat 
      and protein. From the results it is seen that 13% of the sample population falls 
      under severe (grade III) chronic energy deficiency. The average daily consumption 
      of the workers was comparatively lower than their daily energy expenditure, 
      considering the nature of the job which falls under heavy to extremely heavy 
      categories. This negative energy balance is effectively observed in the 
      nutritional anthropometry data. Thus, an immediate ergonomics intervention with 
      better nutrition should be implemented to improve the health status of the 
      workers so they can safely continue to work for a longer period.

TI  - Workload and Performance: Associations, Insensitivities, and Dissociations.
PG  - 374-392
LID - 10.1177/0018720818809590 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to distill and define those influences under 
      which change in objective performance level and the linked cognitive workload 
      reflections of subjective experience and physiological variation either 
      associate, dissociate, or are insensitive, one to another. BACKGROUND: Human 
      factors/ergonomics frequently employs users' self-reports of their own conscious 
      experience, as well as their physiological reactivity, to augment the 
      understanding of changing performance capacity. Under some circumstances, these 
      latter workload responses are the only available assessment information to hand. 
      How such perceptions and physiological responses match, fail to match, or are 
      insensitive to the change in primary-task performance can prove critical to 
      operational success. The reasons underlying these associations, dissociations, 
      and insensitivities are central to the success of future effective human-machine 
      interaction. METHOD: Using extant research on the relations between differing 
      methods of workload assessment, factors influencing their association, 
      dissociation, and insensitivity are identified. RESULTS: Dissociations and 
      insensitivities occur more frequently than extant explanatory theories imply. 
      Methodological and conceptual reasons for these patterns of incongruity are 
      identified and evaluated. APPLICATION: We often seek convergence of results in 
      order to provide coherent explanations as bases for future prediction and 
      practical design implementation. Identifying and understanding the causes as to 
      why different reflections of workload diverge can help practitioners toward 
      operational success.

TI  - A virtual clinic improves pneumococcal vaccination coverage among patients living 
      with HIV at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
PG  - 146-149
LID - 10.1080/09540121.2017.1390542 [doi]
AB  - People living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should receive 
      pneumococcal vaccinations as part of their routine health maintenance. Our goal 
      was to create a "virtual clinic" to help increase rates of pneumococcal 
      vaccination among people living with HIV without adding substantially to the 
      workload of primary providers. We used administrative data from our Veterans 
      Affairs (VA) medical center to identify a cohort of veterans living with HIV who 
      were not current with either the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
      (PCV13), the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) or both. We 
      enrolled these individuals (nâ=â99) into a virtual clinic, notified providers via 
      the electronic medical record and mailed letters to the veterans recommending 
      they receive a pneumococcal vaccine. We also wrote orders for the appropriate 
      pneumococcal vaccine that expired after 90 days. Among the virtual clinic cohort, 
      38% (38/99) of patients received the recommended vaccine within 180 days. 
      Concurrent with our intervention, the Veterans Health Administration deployed a 
      system-wide pneumococcal vaccine clinical reminder that incorporated recent PCV13 
      recommendations. To discern any effect of the virtual clinic beyond that of the 
      clinical reminder, we compared the rate of PCV13 vaccinations among all 
      HIV-positive veterans at our institution to the equivalent population from 2 
      other VA medical centers in Ohio. With consideration of the VHA's system-wide 
      clinical reminder, the proportion of HIV-positive patients who received PCV13 in 
      the first 90 days following the virtual clinic intervention was greater at our 
      facility compared to another Ohio VA medical center (Pâ<â0.05). The virtual 
      clinic improved the pneumococcal vaccine coverage among HIV-positive veterans. 
      These outcomes suggest that even in conjunction with a system-wide clinical 
      reminder, the virtual clinic strategy improves vaccination rates among a 
      high-risk population.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of a Surveillance System for Follow-Up After 
      Colorectal Polypectomy.
PG  - e2334822
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.34822 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The adherence of physicians and patients to published colorectal 
      postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines varies greatly, and patient follow-up is 
      critical but time consuming. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of an automatic 
      surveillance (AS) system in identifying patients after polypectomy, assigning 
      surveillance intervals for different risks of patients, and proactively following 
      up with patients on time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 
      diagnostic/prognostic study, endoscopic and pathological reports of 47â¯544 
      patients undergoing colonoscopy at 3 hospitals between January 1, 2017, and June 
      30, 2022, were collected to develop an AS system based on natural language 
      processing. The performance of the AS system was fully evaluated in internal and 
      external tests according to 5 guidelines worldwide and compared with that of 
      physicians. A multireader, multicase (MRMC) trial was conducted to evaluate use 
      of the AS system and physician guideline adherence, and prospective data were 
      collected to evaluate the success rate in contacting patients and the association 
      with reduced human workload. Data analysis was conducted from July to September 
      2022. EXPOSURES: Assistance of the AS system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      accuracy of the system in identifying patients after polypectomy, stratifying 
      patient risk levels, and assigning surveillance intervals in internal (Renmin 
      Hospital of Wuhan University), external 1 (Wenzhou Central Hospital), and 
      external 2 (The First People's Hospital of Yichang) test sets; the accuracy of 
      physicians and their time burden with and without system assistance; and the rate 
      of successfully informed patients of the system were evaluated. RESULTS: Test 
      sets for 16â¯106 patients undergoing colonoscopy (mean [SD] age, 51.90 [13.40] 
      years; 7690 females [47.75%]) were evaluated. In internal, external 1, and 
      external 2 test sets, the system had an overall accuracy of 99.91% (95% CI, 
      99.83%-99.95%), 99.54% (95% CI, 99.30%-99.70%), and 99.77% (95% CI, 
      99.41%-99.91%), respectively, for identifying types of patients and achieved an 
      overall accuracy of at least 99.30% (95% CI, 98.67%-99.63%) in the internal test 
      set, 98.89% (95% CI, 98.33%-99.27%) in external test set 1, and 98.56% (95% CI, 
      95.86%-99.51%) in external test set 2 for stratifying patient risk levels and 
      assigning surveillance intervals according to 5 guidelines. The system was 
      associated with increased mean (SD) accuracy among physicians vs no AS system in 
      105 patients (98.67% [1.28%] vs 78.10% [18.01%]; Pâ=â.04) in the MRMC trial. In a 
      prospective trial, the AS system successfully informed 82 of 88 patients (93.18%) 
      and was associated with reduced burden of follow-up time vs no AS system (0 vs 
      2.86 h). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that an AS system was 
      associated with improved adherence to guidelines among physicians and reduced 
      workload among physicians and nurses.

AB  - Associative processing is central for human cognition, perception and memory. But 
      while associations often facilitate performance, processing irrelevant 
      associations can interfere with performance, for example when learning new 
      information. The aim of this study was to explore whether associative 
      interference is influenced by contextual factors such as resources availability. 
      Experiments 1-3 show that associative interference increases under high cognitive 
      load. This result generalized to both long-term and short-term memory 
      associations, and to both explicitly learned as well as incidentally learned 
      associations in the linguistic and pictorial domains. Experiment 4 further 
      revealed that attention to associative information can delay one's perceptual 
      processing when lacking resources. Taken together, when resources diminish 
      associative interference increases, and additionally, processing novel and 
      ambiguous information is hindered. These findings bare relevance to other domains 
      as well (e.g., social, educational), in which increased load or stress may prompt 
      an undesirable bias towards prior, misleading information.

AB  - Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of mortality worldwide, primarily 
      attributed to the restricted regenerative potential of the adult human heart 
      following injury. In contrast to their adult counterparts, many neonatal mammals 
      can spontaneously regenerate their myocardium in the first few days of life via 
      extensive proliferation of the pre-existing cardiomyocytes. Reasons for the 
      decline in regenerative capacity during postnatal development, and how to control 
      it, remain largely unexplored. Accumulated evidence suggests that the 
      preservation of regenerative potential depends on a conducive metabolic state in 
      the embryonic and neonatal heart. Along with the postnatal increase in 
      oxygenation and workload, the mammalian heart undergoes a metabolic transition, 
      shifting its primary metabolic substrate from glucose to fatty acids shortly 
      after birth for energy advantage. This metabolic switch causes cardiomyocyte 
      cell-cycle arrest, which is widely regarded as a key mechanism for the loss of 
      regenerative capacity. Beyond energy provision, emerging studies have suggested a 
      link between this intracellular metabolism dynamics and postnatal epigenetic 
      remodeling of the mammalian heart that reshapes the expression of many genes 
      important for cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration, since many 
      epigenetic enzymes utilize kinds of metabolites as obligate cofactors or 
      substrates. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of metabolism 
      and metabolite-mediated epigenetic modifications in cardiomyocyte proliferation, 
      with a particular focus on highlighting the potential therapeutic targets that 
      hold promise to treat human heart failure via metabolic and epigenetic 
      regulations.

AB  - The workload of general surgeons is multifaceted, encompassing not only surgical 
      procedures but also a myriad of other responsibilities. From April to May 2023, 
      we conducted a CHERRIES-compliant internet-based survey analyzing clinical 
      practice, academic engagement, and post-on-call rest. The questionnaire featured 
      six sections with 35 questions. Statistical analysis used Chi-square tests, 
      ANOVA, and logistic regression (SPSS(Â®) v. 28). The survey received a total of 
      1.046 responses (65.4%). Over 78.0% of responders came from Europe, 65.1% came 
      from a general surgery unit; 92.8% of European and 87.5% of North American 
      respondents were involved in research, compared to 71.7% in Africa. Europe led in 
      publishing research studies (6.6âÂ±â8.6 yearly). Teaching involvement was high in 
      North America (100%) and Africa (91.7%). Surgeons reported an average of 
      6.7âÂ±â4.9 on-call shifts per month, with European and North American surgeons 
      experiencing 6.5âÂ±â4.9 and 7.8âÂ±â4.1 on-calls monthly, respectively. African 
      surgeons had the highest on-call frequency (8.7âÂ±â6.1). Post-on-call, only 35.1% 
      of respondents received a day off. Europeans were most likely (40%) to have a day 
      off, while African surgeons were least likely (6.7%). On the adjusted 
      multivariable analysis HDI (Human Development Index) (aOR 1.993) hospital 
      capacityâ>â400 beds (aOR 2.423), working in a specialty surgery unit (aOR 2.087), 
      and making the on-call in-house (aOR 5.446), significantly predicted the 
      likelihood of having a day off after an on-call shift. Our study revealed 
      critical insights into the disparities in workload, access to research, and 
      professional opportunities for surgeons across different continents, underscored 
      by the HDI.

AB  - The extent to which human outcome-response (O-R) priming effects are automatic or 
      under cognitive control is currently unclear. Two experiments tested the effect 
      of cognitive load on O-R priming to shed further light on the debate. In 
      Experiment 1, two instrumental responses earned beer and chocolate points in an 
      instrumental training phase. Instrumental response choice was then tested in the 
      presence of beer, chocolate, and neutral stimuli. On test, a Reversal instruction 
      group was told that the stimuli signalled which response would not be rewarded. 
      The transfer test was also conducted under either minimal (No Load) or 
      considerable (Load) cognitive load. The Non-Reversal groups showed O-R priming 
      effects, where the reward cues increased the instrumental responses that had 
      previously produced those outcomes, relative to the neutral stimulus. This effect 
      was observed even under cognitive load. The Reversal No Load group demonstrated a 
      reversed effect, where response choice was biased towards the response that was 
      most likely to be rewarded according to the instruction. Most importantly, 
      response choice was at chance in the Reversal Load condition. In Experiment 2, 
      cognitive load abolished the sensitivity to outcome devaluation that was 
      otherwise seen when multiple outcomes and responses were cued on test. 
      Collectively, the results demonstrate that complex O-R priming effects are 
      sensitive to cognitive load, whereas the very simple, standard O-R priming effect 
      is more robust.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive-motor interference is a common method used to investigate 
      the cognitive demands of human walking. Using this methodology, consistent 
      effects emerge: under cognitive load, walking velocity decreases, while 
      spatio-temporal variability of walking increases. These effects are often 
      interpreted as indicative of an interference in the ability to control gait. 
      However, walking velocity is highly correlated with most gait parameters; thus, 
      the increase in variability does not necessarily reflect reduced control, but 
      rather a constant signal-to-noise ratio. METHODS: To investigate the effect of 
      cognitive loading on gait variability, we retrospectively analysed 3721 records 
      of healthy young adults, walking with and without a concurrent cognitive task, on 
      a treadmill. RESULTS: Stride duration and length increased under cognitive load, 
      while the variability of these parameters decreased. Further, these effects were 
      different between participants starting to walk without cognitive loading and 
      those starting to walk with cognitive loading. CONCLUSIONS: Dual tasking is more 
      likely to divert the focus of attention away from the walking task, causing a 
      shift of balance between automatic and conscious control, as opposed to 
      interference per-se.

AB  - Managing cognitive load depends on adequate resource allocation by the human 
      brain through the engagement of metastable substates, which are large-scale 
      functional networks that change over time. We employed a novel analysis method, 
      deep autoencoder dynamical analysis (DADA), with 100 healthy adults selected from 
      the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set in rest and six cognitive tasks. The 
      deep autoencoder of DADA described seven recurrent stochastic metastable 
      substates from the functional connectome of BOLD phase coherence matrices. These 
      substates were significantly differentiated in terms of their probability of 
      appearance, time duration, and spatial attributes. We found that during different 
      cognitive tasks, there was a higher probability of having more connected 
      substates dominated by a high degree of connectivity in the thalamus. In 
      addition, compared with those during tasks, resting brain dynamics have a lower 
      level of predictability, indicating a more uniform distribution of metastability 
      between substates, quantified by higher entropy. These novel findings provide 
      empirical evidence for the philosophically motivated cognitive theory, suggesting 
      on-line and off-line as two fundamentally distinct modes of cognition. On-line 
      cognition refers to task-dependent engagement with the sensory input, while 
      off-line cognition is a slower, environmentally detached mode engaged with 
      decision and planning. Overall, the DADA framework provides a bridge between 
      neuroscience and cognitive theory that can be further explored in the future.

LID - 10.1177/00187208231204704 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI), the need to learn the 
      robot's motor-control dynamics is associated with increased cognitive load. 
      Eye-tracking metrics can help understand the dynamics of fluctuating mental 
      workload over the course of learning. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      test eye-tracking measures' sensitivity and reliability to variations in task 
      difficulty, as well as their performance-prediction capability, in physical 
      human-robot collaboration tasks involving an industrial robot for object 
      comanipulation. METHODS: Participants (9M, 9F) learned to coperform a virtual 
      pick-and-place task with a bimanual robot over multiple trials. Joint stiffness 
      of the robot was manipulated to increase motor-coordination demands. The 
      psychometric properties of eye-tracking measures and their ability to predict 
      performance was investigated. RESULTS: Stationary Gaze Entropy and pupil diameter 
      were the most reliable and sensitive measures of workload associated with changes 
      in task difficulty and learning. Increased task difficulty was more likely to 
      result in a robot-monitoring strategy. Eye-tracking measures were able to predict 
      the occurrence of success or failure in each trial with 70% sensitivity and 71% 
      accuracy. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and reliability of eye-tracking measures 
      was acceptable, although values were lower than those observed in cognitive 
      domains. Measures of gaze behaviors indicative of visual monitoring strategies 
      were most sensitive to task difficulty manipulations, and should be explored 
      further for the pHRI domain where motor-control and internal-model formation will 
      likely be strong contributors to workload. APPLICATION: Future collaborative 
      robots can adapt to human cognitive state and skill-level measured using 
      eye-tracking measures of workload and visual attention.

AB  - This review article aims to evaluate a proposed maximum acceptable work duration 
      model for load carriage tasks. It is contended that this concept has particular 
      relevance to physically demanding occupations such as military and firefighting. 
      Personnel in these occupations are often required to perform very physically 
      demanding tasks, over varying time periods, often involving load carriage. 
      Previous research has investigated concepts related to physiological workload 
      limits in occupational settings (e.g. industrial). Evidence suggests however, 
      that existing (unloaded) workload guidelines are not appropriate for load 
      carriage tasks. The utility of this model warrants further work to enable 
      prediction of load carriage durations across a range of functional workloads for 
      physically demanding occupations. If the maximum duration for which personnel can 
      physiologically sustain a load carriage task could be accurately predicted, 
      commanders and supervisors could better plan for and manage tasks to ensure 
      operational imperatives were met whilst minimising health risks for their 
      workers.

LID - e2026011119
AB  - Human learning is supported by multiple neural mechanisms that maturate at 
      different rates and interact in mostly cooperative but also sometimes competitive 
      ways. We tested the hypothesis that mature cognitive mechanisms constrain 
      implicit statistical learning mechanisms that contribute to early language 
      acquisition. Specifically, we tested the prediction that depleting cognitive 
      control mechanisms in adults enhances their implicit, auditory word-segmentation 
      abilities. Young adults were exposed to continuous streams of syllables that 
      repeated into hidden novel words while watching a silent film. Afterward, 
      learning was measured in a forced-choice test that contrasted hidden words with 
      nonwords. The participants also had to indicate whether they explicitly recalled 
      the word or not in order to dissociate explicit versus implicit knowledge. We 
      additionally measured electroencephalography during exposure to measure neural 
      entrainment to the repeating words. Engagement of the cognitive mechanisms was 
      manipulated by using two methods. In experiment 1 (n = 36), inhibitory 
      theta-burst stimulation (TBS) was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex or to a control region. In experiment 2 (n = 60), participants performed a 
      dual working-memory task that induced high or low levels of cognitive fatigue. In 
      both experiments, cognitive depletion enhanced word recognition, especially when 
      participants reported low confidence in remembering the words (i.e., when their 
      knowledge was implicit). TBS additionally modulated neural entrainment to the 
      words and syllables. These findings suggest that cognitive depletion improves the 
      acquisition of linguistic knowledge in adults by unlocking implicit statistical 
      learning mechanisms and support the hypothesis that adult language learning is 
      antagonized by higher cognitive mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the relationship between cognitive load (CL) and automation 
      bias (AB). BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support (CDS) for electronic prescribing 
      can improve safety but introduces the risk of AB, where reliance on CDS replaces 
      vigilance in information seeking and processing. We hypothesized high CL 
      generated by high task complexity would increase AB errors. METHOD: One hundred 
      twenty medical students prescribed medicines for clinical scenarios using a 
      simulated e-prescribing system in a randomized controlled experiment. Quality of 
      CDS (correct, incorrect, and no CDS) and task complexity (low and high) were 
      varied. CL, omission errors (failure to detect prescribing errors), and 
      commission errors (acceptance of false positive alerts) were measured. RESULTS: 
      Increasing complexity from low to high significantly increased CL, F(1, 118) = 
      71.6, p < .001. CDS reduced CL in high-complexity conditions compared to no CDS, 
      F(2, 117) = 4.72, p = .015. Participants who made omission errors in incorrect 
      and no CDS conditions exhibited lower CL compared to those who did not, F(1, 
      636.49) = 3.79, p = .023. CONCLUSION: Results challenge the notion that AB is 
      triggered by increasing task complexity and associated increases in CL. Omission 
      errors were associated with lower CL, suggesting errors may stem from an 
      insufficient allocation of cognitive resources. APPLICATION: This is the first 
      research to examine the relationship between CL and AB. Findings suggest 
      designers and users of CDS systems need to be aware of the risks of AB. 
      Interventions that increase user vigilance and engagement may be beneficial and 
      deserve further investigation.

      Germany.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explores the health status differences between migrants 
      and native Germans, focusing on potential disparities in their workloads. 
      Physical and mental workloads can negatively impact individual health. Since 
      various occupations come with distinct health-related patterns, occupational 
      selection may contribute to systematic health disparities among socio-economic 
      groups. Given the generally poorer health of migrants, they might experience 
      systematic workload differences overall. METHODS: We suggest a conceptual 
      framework for the empirical analysis based on the theory of health as a durable 
      good with health consumption and health investment as key parameters. We quantify 
      the role of work tasks, job requirements and working conditions on individual 
      health based on detailed information from the BIBB/BAuA labour force survey 2012 
      and 2018. RESULTS: The empirical results reveal that migrants, i.e. foreigners 
      and German citizens with a migration background, have a higher perception of 
      workload and related health afflictions within the same occupation. Native 
      Germans, on the other hand, experience a higher burden by high job requirements, 
      both physically and mentally. The findings imply heterogeneous health impacts of 
      work for migrants and native Germans due to differences in health consumption. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The analysis shows that migrants report worse health than natives, 
      with stronger negative effects of work-related conditions on their health, both 
      physically and mentally. Women, in general, report poorer health conditions than 
      men. The findings emphasize the importance of promoting human capital to reduce 
      economic and health disparities, though caution is advised regarding affirmative 
      actions for migrants; further research is needed to understand the underlying 
      mechanisms and address these issues effectively.

TI  - Characteristics and Workload of Pediatricians in China.
LID - e20183532 [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2018-3532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although it is widely believed that China is facing a major shortage 
      of pediatricians, the real situation of the current national status of pediatric 
      human resources and their working conditions has not been evaluated to date. 
      METHODS: We administered a survey to 54â214 hospitals from all 31 provinces in 
      mainland China from 2015 to 2016. Hospital directors of all secondary and 
      tertiary hospitals with pediatric services and a random sample (10%) of primary 
      hospitals provided information on number of pediatricians and their educational 
      levels, specialties, workloads, dropout rates, and other hospital 
      characteristics. A data set of medical resources and socioeconomic information 
      regarding each region (1997-2016) was constructed from the Chinese National 
      Statistics Bureau. The Gini coefficient was used to describe the geographical 
      distributions of pediatricians and hospitals. RESULTS: There were 135â524 
      pediatricians in China or â¼4 pediatricians per 10â000 children. Pediatricians' 
      average educational level was low, with â¼32% having only 3 years of junior 
      college training after high school. The distribution of pediatricians was 
      extremely skewed (Gini coefficient 0.61), and the imbalance of highly educated 
      pediatricians was even more skewed (Gini coefficient 0.68). The dropout rate of 
      pediatricians was 12.6%. Despite an increase in the Chinese government's 
      financial investment in health over the last decade, physicians have been 
      burdened with a greater workload. CONCLUSIONS: Uneven development of the 
      pediatric care system, inadequately trained pediatricians, low job satisfaction, 
      and unmet demand for pediatric care are the major challenges facing China's 
      pediatric health care system.

AB  - Hearing impairment affects many older adults but is often diagnosed decades after 
      speech comprehension in noisy situations has become effortful. Accurate 
      assessment of listening effort may thus help diagnose hearing impairment earlier. 
      However, pupillometry-the most used approach to assess listening effort-has 
      limitations that hinder its use in practice. The current study explores a novel 
      way to assess listening effort through eye movements. Building on cognitive and 
      neurophysiological work, we examine the hypothesis that eye movements decrease 
      when speech listening becomes challenging. In three experiments with human 
      participants from both sexes, we demonstrate, consistent with this hypothesis, 
      that fixation duration increases and spatial gaze dispersion decreases with 
      increasing speech masking. Eye movements decreased during effortful speech 
      listening for different visual scenes (free viewing, object tracking) and speech 
      materials (simple sentences, naturalistic stories). In contrast, pupillometry was 
      less sensitive to speech masking during story listening, suggesting pupillometric 
      measures may not be as effective for the assessments of listening effort in 
      naturalistic speech-listening paradigms. Our results reveal a critical link 
      between eye movements and cognitive load, suggesting that neural activity in the 
      brain regions that support the regulation of eye movements, such as frontal eye 
      field and superior colliculus, are modulated when listening is 
      effortful.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Assessment of listening effort is critical for 
      early diagnosis of age-related hearing loss. Pupillometry is most used but has 
      several disadvantages. The current study explores a novel way to assess listening 
      effort through eye movements. We examine the hypothesis that eye movements 
      decrease when speech listening becomes effortful. We demonstrate, consistent with

AB  - Reducing costs and improvement of product quality are considered important to 
      ensure productivity within a company. Quality deviations during production 
      processes and ergonomics have previously shown to be associated. This study 
      explored the relationship between physical workload and real (found during 
      production processes) and potential (need of extra time and assistance to 
      complete tasks) quality deviations in a line-based assembly plant. The physical 
      workload on and the work rotation between 52 workstations were assessed. As the 
      outcome, real and potential quality deviations were studied during 10 weeks. 
      Results show that workstations with higher physical workload had significantly 
      more real deviations compared to lower workload stations. Static work posture had 
      significantly more potential deviations. Rotation between high and low workload 
      was related to fewer quality deviations compared to rotation between only high 
      workload stations. In conclusion, physical ergonomics seems to be related to real 
      and potential quality deviation within line-based assembly. Practitioner Summary: 
      To ensure good productivity in manufacturing industries, it is important to 
      reduce costs and improve product quality. This study shows that high physical 
      workload is associated with quality deviations and need of extra time and 
      assistance to complete tasks within line-based assembly, which can be financially 
      expensive for a company.

AB  - Cognitive workload is of central importance in the fields of human factors and 
      ergonomics. A reliable measurement of cognitive workload could allow for 
      improvements in human machine interface designs and increase safety in several 
      domains. At present, numerous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) to 
      assess cognitive workload, reporting the rise in cognitive workload to be 
      associated with increases in theta band power and decreases in alpha band power. 
      However, results have been inconsistent with some failing to reach the required 
      level of significance. We hypothesized that the lack of consistency could be 
      related to individual differences in task performance and/or to the small sample 
      sizes in most EEG studies. In the present study we used EEG to assess the 
      increase in cognitive workload occurring in a multitasking environment while 
      taking into account differences in performance. Twenty participants completed a 
      task commonly used in airline pilot recruitment, which included an increasing 
      number of concurrent sub-tasks to be processed from one to four. Subjective 
      ratings, performances scores, pupil size and EEG signals were recorded. Results 
      showed that increases in EEG alpha and theta band power reflected increases in 
      the involvement of cognitive resources for the completion of one to three 
      subtasks in a multitasking environment. These values reached a ceiling when 
      performances dropped. Consistent differences in levels of alpha and theta band 
      power were associated to levels of task performance: highest performance was 
      related to lowest band power.

AB  - Previous research suggests that operators with high workload can distrust and 
      then poorly monitor automation, which has been generally inferred from automation 
      dependence behaviors. To test automation monitoring more directly, the current 
      study measured operators' visual attention allocation, workload, and trust toward 
      imperfect automation in a dynamic multitasking environment. Participants 
      concurrently performed a manual tracking task with two levels of difficulty and a 
      system monitoring task assisted by an unreliable signaling system. Eye movement 
      data indicate that operators allocate less visual attention to monitor automation 
      when the tracking task is more difficult. Participants reported reduced levels of 
      trust toward the signaling system when the tracking task demanded more focused 
      visual attention. Analyses revealed that trust mediated the relationship between 
      the load of the tracking task and attention allocation in Experiment 1, an effect 
      that was not replicated in Experiment 2. Results imply a complex process 
      underlying task load, visual attention allocation, and automation trust during 
      multitasking. Automation designers should consider operators' task load in 
      multitasking workspaces to avoid reduced automation monitoring and distrust 
      toward imperfect signaling systems.

TI  - Human skeletal muscle mitochondrial responses to single-leg intermittent or 
      continuous cycle exercise training matched for absolute intensity and total work.
PG  - 872-881
LID - 10.1111/sms.14332 [doi]
AB  - There is renewed interest in the potential for interval (INT) training to 
      increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial content including whether the response 
      differs from continuous (CONT) training. Comparisons of INT and CONT exercise are 
      impacted by the manner in which protocols are "matched", particularly with 
      respect to exercise intensity, as well as inter-individual differences in 
      training responses. We employed single-leg cycling to facilitate a 
      within-participant design and test the hypothesis that short-term INT training 
      would elicit a greater increase in mitochondrial content than work- and 
      intensity-matched CONT training. Ten young healthy adults (five males and five 
      females) completed 12 training sessions over 4âweeks with each leg. Legs were 
      randomly assigned to complete either 30âmin of CONT exercise at a challenging 
      sustainable workload (~50% single-leg peak power output; Wpeak) or INT exercise 
      that involved 10âÃâ3-min bouts at the same absolute workload. INT bouts were 
      interspersed with 1 min of recovery at 10% Wpeak and each CONT session ended with 
      10 min at 10% Wpeak. Absolute and mean intensity, total training time, and volume 
      were thus matched between legs but the pattern of exercise differed. Contrary to 
      our hypothesis, biomarkers of mitochondrial content including citrate synthase 
      maximal activity, mitochondrial protein content and subsarcolemmal mitochondrial 
      volume increased after CONT (pâ<â0.05) but not INT training. Both training modes 
      increased single-leg Wpeak (pâ<â0.01) and time to exhaustion at 70% of single-leg 
      Wpeak (pâ<â0.01). In a work- and intensity-matched comparison, short-term CONT 
      training increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial content whereas INT training did 
      not.

TI  - A Neurophysiological Evaluation of Cognitive Load during Augmented Reality 
      Interactions in Various Industrial Maintenance and Assembly Tasks.
LID - 10.3390/s23187698 [doi]
LID - 7698
AB  - Augmented reality (AR) has been shown to improve productivity in industry, but 
      its adverse effects (e.g., headaches, eye strain, nausea, and mental workload) on 
      users warrant further investigation. The objective of this study is to 
      investigate the effects of different instruction methods (i.e., HoloLens AR-based 
      and paper-based instructions) and task complexity (low and high-demanding tasks) 
      on cognitive workloads and performance. Twenty-eight healthy males with a mean 
      age of 32.12 (SD 2.45) years were recruited in this study and were randomly 
      divided into two groups. The first group performed the experiment using AR-based 
      instruction, and the second group used paper-based instruction. Performance was 
      measured using total task time (TTT). The cognitive workload was measured using 
      the power of electroencephalograph (EEG) features and the NASA task load index 
      (NASA TLX). The results showed that using AR instructions resulted in a reduction 
      in maintenance times and an increase in mental workload compared to paper 
      instructions, particularly for the more demanding tasks. With AR instruction, 
      0.45% and 14.94% less time was spent on low- and high-demand tasks, respectively, 
      as compared to paper instructions. According to the EEG features, employing AR to 
      guide employees during highly demanding maintenance tasks increased information 
      processing, which could be linked with an increased germane cognitive load. 
      Increased germane cognitive load means participants can better facilitate 
      long-term knowledge and skill acquisition. These results suggested that AR is 
      superior and recommended for highly demanding maintenance tasks since it speeds 
      up maintenance times and increases the possibility that information is stored in 
      long-term memory and encrypted for recalls.

      human-automation interaction and interfaces.

AB  - Operators of highly automated driving systems may exhibit behaviour 
      characteristic for overtrust issues due to an insufficient awareness of 
      automation fallibility. Consequently, situation awareness in critical situations 
      is reduced and safe driving performance following emergency takeovers is impeded. 
      A driving simulator study was used to assess the impact of dynamically 
      communicating system uncertainties on monitoring, trust, workload, takeovers, and 
      physiological responses. The uncertainty information was conveyed visually using 
      a stylised heart beat combined with a numerical display and users were engaged in 
      a visual search task. Multilevel analysis results suggest that uncertainty 
      communication helps operators calibrate their trust and gain situation awareness 
      prior to critical situations, resulting in safer takeovers. In addition, eye 
      tracking data indicate that operators can adjust their gaze behaviour in 
      correspondence with the level of uncertainty. However, conveying uncertainties 
      using a visual display significantly increases operator workload and impedes 
      users in the execution of non-driving related tasks. Practitioner Summary: This 
      article illustrates how the communication of system uncertainty information helps 
      operators calibrate their trust in automation and, consequently, gain situation 
      awareness. Multilevel analysis results of a driving simulator study affirm the 
      benefits for trust calibration and highlight that operators adjust their 
      behaviour according to multiple uncertainty levels.

TI  - On the dynamics of the human endocrine pancreas and potential consequences for 
      the development of type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 503-511
LID - 10.1007/s00592-019-01420-8 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the human islet life span, and beta-cell neogenesis is 
      generally considered rare in adults. However, based on available data on 
      beta-cell proliferation, calculations can be made suggesting that the dynamics of 
      the endocrine pancreas is considerable even during adulthood, with islet 
      neogenesis and a sustained increase in size of already formed islets. 
      Islet-associated hemorrhages, frequently observed in most mammals including 
      humans, could account for a considerable loss of islet parenchyma balancing the 
      constant beta-cell proliferation. Notably, in subjects with type 1 diabetes, 
      periductal accumulation of leukocytes and fibrosis is frequently observed, 
      findings that are likely to negatively affect islet neogenesis from endocrine 
      progenitor cells present in the periductal area. Impaired neogenesis would 
      disrupt the balance, result in loss of islet mass, and eventually lead to 
      beta-cell deficiency and compromised glucose metabolism, with increased islet 
      workload and blood perfusion of remaining islets. These changes would impose 
      initiation of a vicious circle further increasing the frequency of vascular 
      events and hemorrhages within remaining islets until the patient eventually loses 
      all beta-cells and becomes c-peptide negative.

TI  - The influence of context on information processing.
PG  - 167-184
LID - 10.1007/s10339-020-00958-8 [doi]
AB  - The main research question of this study is how the processing of information 
      relates to different contextual characteristics. More specifically, how the 
      context is associated with efficiency of information processing (success and 
      speed), size of chunks, speed of chunk processing and the recall of a chunk. The 
      research domain was the game of chess. The efficiency of information processing 
      and the chunk characteristics were defined with the reconstruction of sequences 
      of chess moves. Context variables were defined using a slightly adapted chess 
      program. Variables on information dispersion, deviation, complexity and 
      positivity were extracted in each chess position. Overall, the results showed 
      that higher dispersion and complexity and lower positivity of information in a 
      context lead to less efficient information processing. The results support the 
      assumptions of the cognitive load theory about the negative effects of external 
      factors burden on information processing and working memory. Our results also 
      support the ACT-R theory, which suggests that more frequent information has a 
      higher activation level and can therefore be retrieved more easily and quickly. 
      The results are also congruent with the positivity effect, which proposes that it 
      is easier to remember positive information than negative information. The 
      findings of our study can be beneficial for the development of intelligent 
      tutoring systems and the design of human-computer interaction systems.

TI  - Influence of human-machine interactions and task demand on automation selection 
      and use.
PG  - 1601-1612
LID - 10.1080/00140139.2018.1501517 [doi]
AB  - A seminal work by Sheridan and Verplank depicted 10 levels of automation, ranging 
      from no automation to an automation that acts completely autonomously without 
      human support. These levels of automation were later complemented with a 
      four-stage model of human information processing. Next, human-machine cooperation 
      centred models and associated cooperation modes were introduced. The objective of 
      the experiment was to test which human-machine theorie describe automation use 
      better. The participants were asked to choose repeatedly between four automation 
      types (i.e. no automation, warning, co-action, function delegation) to complete 
      three multi-attribute task battery tasks. The results showed that the 
      participants favour the selection of automation types offering the best 
      human-machine interactions quality rather that the most effective automation 
      type. Contrary to human-machine cooperation models, technology centred models 
      could not predict accurately automation selection. The most advanced automation 
      was not the most selected. Practitioner Summary: The experiment dealt with how 
      people select different automation types to complete the multi-attribute task 
      battery that emulates recreational aircraft pilot tasks. Automation performance 
      was not the main criteria that explain automation use, as people tend to select 
      an automation type based on the quality of the human-machine cooperation.

TI  - Learning-based control approaches for service robots on cloth manipulation and 
      dressing assistance: a comprehensive review.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.1186/s12984-022-01078-4 [doi]
LID - 117
AB  - BACKGROUND: Service robots are defined as reprogrammable, sensor-based 
      mechatronic devices that perform useful services in an autonomous or 
      semi-autonomous way to human activities in an everyday environment. As the number 
      of elderly people grows, service robots, which can operate complex tasks like 
      dressing tasks for disabled people, are being demanded increasingly. 
      Consequently, there is a growing interest in studying dressing tasks, such as 
      putting on a t-shirt, a hat, or shoes. Service robots or robot manipulators have 
      been developed to accomplish these tasks using several control approaches. The 
      robots used in this kind of application are usually bimanual manipulator (i.e. 
      Baxter robot) or single manipulators (i.e. Ur5 robot). These arms are usually 
      used for recognizing clothes and then folding them or putting an item on the arm 
      or on the head of a person. METHODS: This work provides a comprehensive review of 
      the most relevant attempts/works of robotic dressing assistance with a focus on 
      the control methodology used for dressing tasks. Three main areas of control 
      methods for dressing tasks are proposed: Supervised Learning (SL), Learning from 
      Demonstration (LfD), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). There are also other 
      methods that cannot be classified into these three areas and hence they have been 
      placed in the other methods section. This research was conducted within three 
      databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Accurate exclusion 
      criteria were applied to screen the 2594 articles found (at the end 39 articles 
      were selected). For each work, an evaluation of the model is made. CONCLUSION: 
      Current research in cloth manipulation and dressing assistance focuses on 
      learning-based robot control approach. Inferring the cloth state is integral to 
      learning the manipulation and current research uses principles of Computer Vision 
      to address the issue. This makes the larger problem of control robot based on 
      learning data-intensive; therefore, a pressing need for standardized datasets 
      representing different cloth shapes, types, materials, and human demonstrations 
      (for LfD) exists. Simultaneously, efficient simulation capabilities, which 
      closely model the deformation of clothes, are required to bridge the reality gap 
      between the real-world and virtual environments for deploying the RL trial and 
      error paradigm. Such powerful simulators are also vital to collect valuable data 
      to train SL and LfD algorithms that will help reduce human workload.

AB  - In aviation, emotion and cognitive workload can considerably increase the 
      probability of human error. An accurate online physiological monitoring of 
      pilot's mental state could prevent accidents. The heart rate (HR) and heart rate 
      variability (HRV) of 21 private pilots were analysed during two realistic flight 
      simulator scenarios. Emotion was manipulated by a social stressor and cognitive 
      workload with the difficulty of a secondary task. Our results confirmed the 
      sensitivity of the HR to cognitive demand and training effects, with increased HR 
      when the task was more difficult and decreased HR with training (time-on-task). 
      Training was also associated with an increased HRV, with increased values along 
      the flight scenario time course. Finally, the social stressor seemed to provoke 
      an emotional reaction that enhanced motivation and performance on the secondary 
      task. However, this was not reflected by the cardiovascular activity.

TI  - Optimizing the balance between task automation and human manual control in 
      simulated submarine track management.
PG  - 240-262
LID - 10.1037/xap0000126 [doi]
AB  - Automation can improve operator performance and reduce workload, but can also 
      degrade operator situation awareness (SA) and the ability to regain manual 
      control. In 3 experiments, we examined the extent to which automation could be 
      designed to benefit performance while ensuring that individuals maintained SA and 
      could regain manual control. Participants completed a simulated submarine track 
      management task under varying task load. The automation was designed to 
      facilitate information acquisition and analysis, but did not make task decisions. 
      Relative to a condition with no automation, the continuous use of automation 
      improved performance and reduced subjective workload, but degraded SA. Automation 
      that was engaged and disengaged by participants as required (adaptable 
      automation) moderately improved performance and reduced workload relative to no 
      automation, but degraded SA. Automation engaged and disengaged based on task load 
      (adaptive automation) provided no benefit to performance or workload, and 
      degraded SA relative to no automation. Automation never led to significant 
      return-to-manual deficits. However, all types of automation led to degraded 
      performance on a nonautomated task that shared information processing 
      requirements with automated tasks. Given these outcomes, further research is 
      urgently required to establish how to design automation to maximize performance 
      while keeping operators cognitively engaged. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and their steady-state counterpart 
      (subcortical steady-state responses, SSSRs) are generally thought to be 
      insensitive to cognitive demands. However, a handful of studies report that SSSRs 
      are modulated depending on the subject×³s focus of attention, either towards or 
      away from an auditory stimulus. Here, we explored whether attentional focus 
      affects the envelope-following response (EFR), which is a particular kind of 
      SSSR, and if so, whether the effects are specific to which sound elements in a 
      sound mixture a subject is attending (selective auditory attentional modulation), 
      specific to attended sensory input (inter-modal attentional modulation), or 
      insensitive to attentional focus. We compared the strength of EFR-stimulus phase 
      locking in human listeners under various tasks: listening to a monaural stimulus, 
      selectively attending to a particular ear during dichotic stimulus presentation, 
      and attending to visual stimuli while ignoring dichotic auditory inputs. We 
      observed no systematic changes in the EFR across experimental manipulations, even 
      though cortical EEG revealed attention-related modulations of alpha activity 
      during the task. We conclude that attentional effects, if any, on human 
      subcortical representation of sounds cannot be observed robustly using EFRs. This 
      article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Prediction and Attention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Cognitive Load Theory provides a well-established framework for 
      investigating aspects of learning situations that demand learners' working memory 
      resources. However, the interplay of these aspects at the cognitive and neural 
      level is still not fully understood. METHOD: We developed four computational 
      models in the cognitive architecture ACT-R to clarify underlying memory-related 
      strategies and mechanisms. Our models account for human data of an experiment 
      that required participants to perform a symbol sequence learning task with 
      embedded interruptions. We explored the inclusion of subsymbolic mechanisms to 
      explain these data and used our final model to generate fMRI predictions. 
      RESULTS: The final model indicates a reasonable fit for reaction times and 
      accuracy and links the fMRI predictions to the Cognitive Load Theory. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our work emphasizes the influence of task characteristics and 
      supports a process-related view on cognitive load in instructional scenarios. It 
      further contributes to the discussion of underlying mechanisms at a neural level.

AB  - In our anxiogenic and stressful world, the maintenance of an optimal cognitive 
      performance is a constant challenge. It is particularly true in complex working 
      environments (e.g. flight deck, air traffic control tower), where individuals 
      have sometimes to cope with a high mental workload and stressful situations. 
      Several models (i.e. processing efficiency theory, cognitive-energetical 
      framework) have attempted to provide a conceptual basis on how human performance 
      is modulated by high workload and stress/anxiety. These models predict that 
      stress can reduce human cognitive efficiency, even in the absence of a visible 
      impact on the task performance. Performance may be protected under stress thanks 
      to compensatory effort, but only at the expense of a cognitive cost. Yet, the 
      psychophysiological cost of this regulation remains unclear. We designed two 
      experiments involving pupil diameter, cardiovascular and prefrontal oxygenation 
      measurements. Participants performed the Toulouse N-back Task that intensively 
      engaged both working memory and mental calculation processes under the threat (or 
      not) of unpredictable aversive sounds. The results revealed that higher task 
      difficulty (higher n level) degraded the performance and induced an increased 
      tonic pupil diameter, heart rate and activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, 
      and a decreased phasic pupil response and heart rate variability. Importantly, 
      the condition of stress did not impact the performance, but at the expense of a 
      psychophysiological cost as demonstrated by lower phasic pupil response, and 
      greater heart rate and prefrontal activity. Prefrontal cortex seems to be a 
      central region for mitigating the influence of stress because it subserves 
      crucial functions (e.g. inhibition, working memory) that can promote the 
      engagement of coping strategies. Overall, findings confirmed the 
      psychophysiological cost of both mental effort and stress. Stress likely 
      triggered increased motivation and the recruitment of additional cognitive 
      resources that minimize its aversive effects on task performance (effectiveness), 
      but these compensatory efforts consumed resources that caused a loss of cognitive 
      efficiency (ratio between performance effectiveness and mental effort).

TI  - Development and validation of a behavioural video coding scheme for detecting 
      mental workload in manual assembly.
PG  - 78-102
LID - 10.1080/00140139.2020.1811400 [doi]
AB  - Manual assembly in the future Industry 4.0 workplace will put high demands on 
      operators' cognitive processing. The development of mental workload (MWL) 
      measures therefore looms large. Physiological gauges such as 
      electroencephalography (EEG) show promising possibilities, but still lack 
      sufficient reliability when applied in the field. This study presents an 
      alternative measure with a substantial ecological validity. First, we developed a 
      behavioural video coding scheme identifying 11 assembly behaviours potentially 
      revealing MWL being too high. Subsequently, we explored its validity by analysing 
      videos of 24 participants performing a high and a low complexity assembly. 
      Results showed that five of the behaviours identified, such as freezing and the 
      amount of part rotations, significantly differed in occurrence and/or duration 
      between the two conditions. The study hereby proposes a novel and naturalistic 
      method that could help practitioners to map and redesign critical assembly 
      phases, and researchers to enrich validation of MWL-measures through measurement 
      triangulation. Practitioner summary: Current physiological mental workload (MWL) 
      measures still lack sufficient reliability when applied in the field. Therefore, 
      we identified several observable assembly behaviours that could reveal MWL being 
      too high. The results propose a method to map MWL by observing specific assembly 
      behaviours such as freezing and rotating parts. Abbreviations: MWL: mental

AB  - Obesity is a major health concern in modern societies. Although decreased 
      physical activity and enhanced intake of high-caloric foods are important risk 
      factors for developing obesity, human behavior during eating also plays a role. 
      Previous studies have shown that distraction while eating increases food intake 
      and leads to impaired processing of food stimuli. As olfaction is the most 
      important sense involved in flavor perception, we used functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging techniques to investigate the influence of cognitive memory 
      load on olfactory perception and processing. Low- and high-caloric food odors 
      were presented in combination with either low or high cognitive loads utilizing a 
      memory task. The efficacy of the memory task was verified by a decrease in 
      participant recall accuracy and an increase in skin conductance response during 
      high cognitive load. Our behavioral data reveal a diminished perceived intensity 
      for low- but not high-caloric food odors during high cognitive load. For 
      low-caloric food odors, bilateral orbitofrontal (OFC) and piriform cortices 
      (pirC) showed significantly lower activity during high compared with low 
      cognitive load. For high-caloric food odors, a similar effect was established in 
      pirC, but not in OFC. Insula activity correlates with higher intensity ratings 
      found during the low cognitive load condition. We conclude lower activity in pirC 
      and OFC to be responsible for diminished intensity perception, comparable to 
      results in olfactory impaired patients and elderly. Further studies should 
      investigate the influence of olfactory/gustatory intensities on food choices 
      under distraction with special regards to low-caloric food.

TI  - NASA-TLX Assessment of Surgeon Workload Variation Across Specialties.
PG  - 686-692
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000003058 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With advancements in surgical equipment and procedures, human-system 
      interactions in operating rooms affect surgeon workload and performance. Workload 
      was measured across surgical specialties using surveys to identify potential 
      predictors of high workload for future performance improvement. SUMMARY 
      BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical instrumentation and technique advancements have 
      implications for surgeon workload and human-systems interactions. To understand 
      and improve the interaction of components in the work system, NASA-Task Load 
      Index can measure workload across various fields. Baseline workload measurements 
      provide a broad overview of the field and identify areas most in need of 
      improvement. METHODS: Surgeons were administered a modified NASA-Task Load Index 
      survey (0â=âlow, 20â=âhigh) following each procedure. Patient and procedural 
      factors were retrieved retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-four surgeons (41% 
      female) completed 662 surgery surveys (M = 14.85, SD = 7.94), of which 506 (76%) 
      have associated patient and procedural data. Mental demand (M = 7.7, SD = 5.56), 
      physical demand (M = 7.0, SD = 5.66), and effort (M = 7.8, SD = 5.77) were the 
      highest rated workload subscales. Surgeons reported difficulty levels higher than 
      expected for 22% of procedures, during which workload was significantly higher (P 
      < 0.05) and procedural durations were significantly longer (P > 0.001). Surgeons 
      reported poorer perceived performance during cases with unexpectedly high 
      difficulty (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When procedural difficulty is greater than 
      expected, there are negative implications for mental and physical demand that 
      result in poorer perceived performance. Investigations are underway to identify 
      patient and surgical variables associated with unexpected difficulty and high 
      workload. Future efforts will focus on re-engineering the surgical planning 
      process and procedural environment to optimize workload and performance for 
      improved surgical care.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro postovulatory aging: when time works against oocyte quality?
PG  - 905-918
LID - 10.1007/s10815-022-02418-y [doi]
AB  - In mammalian species an optimal fertilization window during which successful 
      fertilization occurs. In the majority of mammals estrus marks ovulation time and 
      coincident with mating, thereby allowing the synchronized meeting in the 
      fallopian tubes, between freshly ejaculated sperm and freshly ovulated oocytes. 
      Conversely, women do not show natural visual signs of ovulation such 
      that fertilization can occur hours later involving an aged oocyte and freshly 
      ejaculated spermatozoa. During this time, the oocyte undergoes a rapid 
      degradation known as "postovulatory aging" (POA). POA may become particularly 
      important in the human-assisted reproductive technologies, as the fertilization 
      of retrieved mature oocytes can be delayed due to increased laboratory workload 
      or because of unforeseeable circumstances, like the delayed availability of semen 
      samples. This paper is an updated review of the consequences of POA, either in 
      vivo or in vitro, on oocyte quality with particular attention to modifications 
      caused by POA on oocyte nuclear, cytoplasmic, genomic, and epigenetic maturation, 
      and embryo development.

TI  - Functional Involvement of Human Periaqueductal Gray and Other Midbrain Nuclei in 
      Cognitive Control.
PG  - 6180-6189
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2043-18.2019 [doi]
AB  - Recent theoretical advances have motivated the hypothesis that the periaqueductal 
      gray (PAG) participates in behaviors that involve changes in the autonomic 
      control of visceromotor activity, including during cognitively demanding tasks. 
      We used ultra-high-field (7 tesla) fMRI to measure human brain activity at 1.1 mm 
      resolution while participants completed a working memory task. Consistent with 
      prior work, participants were less accurate and responded more slowly with 
      increasing memory load-signs of increasing task difficulty. Whole-brain fMRI 
      analysis revealed increased activity in multiple cortical areas with increasing 
      working memory load, including frontal and parietal cortex, dorsal cingulate, 
      supplementary motor area, and anterior insula. Several dopamine-rich midbrain 
      nuclei, such as the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, also exhibited 
      load-dependent increases in activation. To investigate PAG involvement during 
      cognitive engagement, we developed an automated method for segmenting and 
      spatially normalizing the PAG. Analyses using cross-validated linear support 
      vector machines showed that the PAG discriminated high versus low working memory 
      load conditions with 95% accuracy in individual subjects based on activity 
      increases in lateral and ventrolateral PAG. Effect sizes in the PAG were 
      comparable in magnitude to those in many of the cortical areas. These findings 
      suggest that cognitive control is not only associated with cortical activity in 
      the frontal and parietal lobes, but also with increased activity in the 
      subcortical PAG and other midbrain regions involved in the regulation of 
      autonomic nervous system function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Functional neuroimaging 
      in humans has shown that cognitive control engages multiple corticostriatal 
      networks and brainstem nuclei, but theoretical advances suggest that the 
      periaqueductal gray (PAG) should also be engaged during cognitively demanding 
      tasks. Recent advances in ultra-high-field fMRI provided an opportunity to obtain 
      the first evidence that increased activation of intermediate and rostral portions 
      of lateral and ventrolateral PAG columns in humans is modulated by cognitive 
      load. These findings suggest that cognitive control is not solely mediated by 
      activity in the cortex, but that midbrain structures important for autonomic 
      regulation also play a crucial role in higher-order cognition.

TI  - Fatigue and workload in short and long-haul train driving.
PG  - 425-33
LID - 10.3233/WOR-162328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little has been investigated regarding the role of shift schedule on 
      fatigue and workload among Iranian train drivers. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to 
      compare train drivers' fatigue and workload between a long-haul and a short-haul 
      train trips. METHODS: One-hundred train drivers, in two routes of Tehran-Mashhad 
      (long-haul) and Tehran-Semnan (short-haul), were asked to complete the 
      Samn-Perelli Fatigue Scale prior to departure, immediately after ending driving 
      duty on the way going, and immediately after ending driving on the way back. 
      Moreover, they were asked to complete NASA-TLX at the end of their shift. 
      RESULTS: Accordingly, understudy train drivers stated relatively similar levels 
      of fatigue and workload for the two trips. Furthermore, fatigue scores were 
      significantly higher at the end of shifts in both routes. CONCLUSION: Overall, 
      train drivers in long-haul trips had longer rest hours between the ways going and 
      coming back, which seems to compensate for the side effects of longer driving 
      durations.

TI  - Look into my eyes: a "faceless" avatar interviewer lowers reporting threshold for 
      adult eyewitnesses.
PG  - 1761-1773

AB  - Evidential interviewing is often used to gather important information, which can 
      determine the outcome of a criminal case. An interviewer's facial features, 
      however, may impact reporting during this task. Here, we investigated adults' 
      interview performance using a novel tool-a faceless avatar interviewer-designed 
      to minimize the impact of an interviewer's visual communication signals, 
      potentially enhancing memory performance. Adults were interviewed about the 
      details of a video by (1) a human-appearing avatar or a human interviewer 
      (Experiment 1; N = 105) or (2) a human-appearing avatar or a faceless avatar 
      interviewer (Experiment 2; N = 109). Participants assigned to the avatar 
      interviewer condition were (1) asked whether they thought the interviewer was 
      either computer or human operated (Experiment 1) or (2) explicitly told that the 
      interviewer was either computer or human operated (Experiment 2). Adults' memory 
      performance was statistically equivalent when they were interviewed by a 
      human-appearing avatar or a human interviewer, but, relative to the 
      human-appearing avatar, adults who were interviewed by a faceless avatar reported 
      more correct (but also incorrect) details in response to free-recall questions. 
      Participants who indicated that the avatar interviewer was computer operated-as 
      opposed to human operated-provided more accurate memory reports, but specifically 
      telling participants that the avatar was computer operated or human operated had 
      no influence on their memory reports. The present study introduced a novel 
      interviewing tool and highlighted the possible cognitive and social influences of 
      an interviewer's facial features on adults' report of a witnessed event.

TI  - Neural correlates of working memory's suppression of aversive olfactory 
      distraction effects.
PG  - 2254-2268
LID - 10.1007/s11682-020-00419-y [doi]
AB  - Human cognitive performance is often disrupted by distractions related to 
      aversive stimuli and affective states, but, paradoxically, there is also evidence 
      to suggest that high working memory demands reduce the impact of aversive 
      distraction. Previous empirical work suggests this latter effect occurs because 
      working memory demands reduce attention to off-task processes, but the brain 
      regions that mediate this effect remain uncertain. The current study utilizes a 
      novel distraction manipulation involving unpleasant odorants to identify neural 
      structures that buffer performance from aversive distraction under high working 
      memory demands, and to clarify their connectivity in this context. Twenty-one 
      healthy young adults (12 women) completed a verbal n-back task under two levels 
      of load and were concurrently exposed to either room air or aversive odorants. 
      Three brain regions displayed increases in neural responses to olfactory 
      distractors under high load only; the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the 
      left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and right cerebellar Crus I. Of these 
      regions, only the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex also displayed context-specific 
      connectivity with a region thought to be involved in off-task processes: the 
      dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Overall, results suggest that, under high working 
      memory demands, areas of the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum shield cognition 
      from aversive distraction, potentially through interactions with brain structures 
      involved in off-task processes.

TI  - Nursing workload assessment in an intensive care unit: A 5-year retrospective 
      analysis.
PG  - 528-540
LID - 10.1111/jocn.15570 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To study the correlation between the workload of intensive care nursing 
      teams and the sociodemographic, anthropometric and clinical characteristics of 
      patients in critical condition in a Portuguese Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during a 
      5-year period. BACKGROUND: Currently, indices of nursing workload quantification 
      are one of the resources used for planning and evaluating ICUs. Evidence shows 
      that there are several factors related to critical patients and their 
      hospitalisation which potentially influence the nursing workload. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort analysis of a health record database from adult patients 
      admitted to a Portuguese ICU between 1 January 2015-31 December 2019. METHODS: 
      Simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28) scores of 730 adult 
      patients. Three TISS-28 assessments were considered: first assessment, last 
      assessment and average. The STROBE guidelines were used in reporting this study. 
      RESULTS: The TISS-28 has an average of 34.2 Â± 6.9 points at admission, which is 
      considered a high nursing workload. A somewhat lower result was found for the 
      discharge and average assessments. It shows that basic activities accounted for 
      the highest percentage of time spent (38.0%), followed by the cardiovascular 
      support category (26.5%). The TISS-28 shows consistent results throughout the 
      study period, despite a small trend reduction in the last 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lower workloads were found for age â¤44 years and with a shorter length of stay. 
      Higher workload was more probable in patients classified in Cullen Class IV 
      (OR = 2.5) and with a normal to higher weight percentile (OR = 1.9 and 1.5, 
      respectively). RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Knowledge of the factors 
      influencing the nursing workload facilitates the implementation of rules to 
      improve performance in nursing interventions, based on the redefinition of care 
      priorities, increased productivity, human resources management and reduction of 
      additional costs to the organisation, related to possible adverse events, among 
      others.

TI  - Work-Related Psychosocial Factors and Their Effects on Mental Workload Perception 
      and Body Postures.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph21070876 [doi]
LID - 876
AB  - The perception of work is closely linked to body reactions that facilitate task 
      performance. Previous studies have shown that psychosocial work factors 
      significantly impact employee health on both psychological and physical levels, 
      though their cross-sectional designs limit causal interpretations. In this study, 
      participants performed sitting and standing tasks under four different levels of 
      mental workload. The NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) assessed mental workload 
      perception across six dimensions, while Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) and 
      Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) scores evaluated body postures for standing 
      and sitting tasks, respectively. This study examined the effects of alarms, 
      distractions, and time constraints-common psychosocial factors in healthcare 
      environments-on human behavior. We compared NASA-TLX scores with corresponding 
      REBA/RULA scores to evaluate how perceived mental workload affects body postures. 
      One-way ANOVA assessed the impact of experimental conditions on response 
      variables, and Pearson correlation analyses explored the relationships between 
      psychosocial factors and these variables. Results indicated that alarm conditions 
      most negatively impacted mental workload perception and body postures. Temporal 
      demand and effort scores were particularly affected by psychosocial factors in 
      both tasks. Gender influenced physical demand and performance scores (higher in 
      females) for the standing task but did not affect REBA and RULA scores. These 
      findings suggest that organizational and psychosocial factors significantly 
      influence healthcare workers' behavior, health, and patient safety. Further 
      research is needed to evaluate the specific effects of psychosocial factors on 
      both physical and mental workload to understand the relationship between overall 
      task workload and occupational disorders.

TI  - Cognitive load associated with speaking clearly in reverberant rooms.
PG  - 20069

LID - 20069
AB  - Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction, yet many individuals 
      must speak in less-than-ideal acoustic environments daily. Adapting their speech 
      to ensure intelligibility in these varied settings can impose a significant 
      cognitive burden. Understanding this burden on talkers has significant 
      implications for the design of public spaces and workplace environments, as well 
      as speaker training programs. The aim of this study was to examine how room 
      acoustics and speaking style affect cognitive load through self-rating of mental 
      demand and pupillometry. Nineteen adult native speakers of American English were 
      instructed to read sentences in both casual and clear speech-a technique known to 
      enhance intelligibility-across three levels of reverberation (0.05 s, 1.2 s, and 
      1.83 s at 500-1000 Hz). Our findings revealed that speaking style consistently 
      affects the cognitive load on talkers more than room acoustics across the tested 
      reverberation range. Specifically, pupillometry data suggested that speaking in 
      clear speech elevates the cognitive load comparably to speaking in a room with 
      long reverberation, challenging the conventional view of clear speech as an 
      'easy' strategy for improving intelligibility. These results underscore the

AB  - The diameter of the human pupil tracks working memory processing and is 
      associated with activity in the frontoparietal network. At the same time, recent 
      neuroimaging research has linked human pupil fluctuations to activity in the 
      salience network. In this combined functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI)/pupillometry study, we recorded the pupil size of healthy human 
      participants while they performed a blockwise organized working memory task 
      (N-back) inside an MRI scanner in order to monitor the pupil fluctuations 
      associated neural activity during working memory processing. We first confirmed 
      that mean pupil size closely followed working memory load. Combining this with 
      fMRI data, we focused on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) correlates of mean 
      pupil size modeled onto the task blocks as a parametric modulation. Interrogating 
      this modulated task regressor, we were able to retrieve the frontoparietal 
      network. Next, to fully exploit the within-block dynamics, we divided the blocks 
      into 1 s time bins and filled these with corresponding pupil change values 
      (first-order derivative of pupil size). We found that pupil change within N-back 
      blocks was positively correlated with BOLD amplitudes in the areas of the 
      salience network (namely bilateral insula, and anterior cingulate cortex). Taken 
      together, fMRI with simultaneous measurement of pupil parameters constitutes a 
      valuable tool to dissect working memory subprocesses related to both working 
      memory load and salience of the presented stimuli.

AB  - In SAE Level 3 automated driving, taking over control from automation raises 
      significant safety concerns because drivers out of the vehicle control loop have 
      difficulty negotiating takeover transitions. Existing studies on takeover 
      transitions have focused on drivers' behavioral responses to takeover requests 
      (TORs). As a complement, this exploratory study aimed to examine drivers' 
      psychophysiological responses to TORs as a result of varying non-driving-related 
      tasks (NDRTs), traffic density and TOR lead time. A total number of 102 drivers 
      were recruited and each of them experienced 8 takeover events in a high fidelity 
      fixed-base driving simulator. Drivers' gaze behaviors, heart rate (HR) 
      activities, galvanic skin responses (GSRs), and facial expressions were recorded 
      and analyzed during two stages. First, during the automated driving stage, we 
      found that drivers had lower heart rate variability, narrower horizontal gaze 
      dispersion, and shorter eyes-on-road time when they had a high level of cognitive 
      load relative to a low level of cognitive load. Second, during the takeover 
      transition stage, 4 s lead time led to inhibited blink numbers and larger maximum 
      and mean GSR phasic activation compared to 7 s lead time, whilst heavy traffic 
      density resulted in increased HR acceleration patterns than light traffic 
      density. Our results showed that psychophysiological measures can indicate 
      specific internal states of drivers, including their workload, emotions, 
      attention, and situation awareness in a continuous, non-invasive and real-time 
      manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using 
      psychophysiological measures in automated driving and for future applications in 
      driver monitoring systems and adaptive alert systems.

AB  - The 5.0 industry promotes collaborative robots (cobots). This research studies 
      the impacts of cobot collaboration using an experimental setup. 120 participants 
      realized a simple and a complex assembly task. 50% collaborated with another 
      human (H/H) and 50% with a cobot (H/C). The workload and the acceptability of the 
      cobotic collaboration were measured. Working with a cobot decreases the effect of 
      the task complexity on the human workload and on the output quality. However, it 
      increases the time completion and the number of gestures (while decreasing their 
      frequency). The H/C couples have a higher chance of success but they take more 
      time and more gestures to realize the task. The results of this research could 
      help developers and stakeholders to understand the impacts of implementing a 
      cobot in production chains.

TI  - Neural correlate of the construction of sentence meaning.
PG  - E6256-E6262
AB  - The neural processes that underlie your ability to read and understand this 
      sentence are unknown. Sentence comprehension occurs very rapidly, and can only be 
      understood at a mechanistic level by discovering the precise sequence of 
      underlying computational and neural events. However, we have no continuous and 
      online neural measure of sentence processing with high spatial and temporal 
      resolution. Here we report just such a measure: intracranial recordings from the 
      surface of the human brain show that neural activity, indexed by Î³-power, 
      increases monotonically over the course of a sentence as people read it. This 
      steady increase in activity is absent when people read and remember 
      nonword-lists, despite the higher cognitive demand entailed, ruling out accounts 
      in terms of generic attention, working memory, and cognitive load. Response 
      increases are lower for sentence structure without meaning ("Jabberwocky" 
      sentences) and word meaning without sentence structure (word-lists), showing that 
      this effect is not explained by responses to syntax or word meaning alone. 
      Instead, the full effect is found only for sentences, implicating compositional 
      processes of sentence understanding, a striking and unique feature of human 
      language not shared with animal communication systems. This work opens up new 
      avenues for investigating the sequence of neural events that underlie the 
      construction of linguistic meaning.

AB  - Postural and walking instabilities contribute to falls in older adults. Given 
      that shoes affect human locomotor stability and that visual, cognitive and 
      somatosensory systems deteriorate during aging, we aimed to: (1) compare the 
      effects of footwear type on stability and mobility in persons with a history of 
      falls, and (2) determine whether the effect of footwear type on stability is 
      altered by the absence of visual input or by an additional cognitive load. Thirty 
      participants performed standing and walking trials in three footwear conditions, 
      i.e. conventional shoes, minimal shoes, and barefoot. The outcomes were: (1) 
      postural stability (movement of the center of pressure during eyes open/closed), 
      (2) walking stability (Margin of Stability during normal/dual-task walking), (3) 
      mobility (the Timed Up and Go test and the Star Excursion Balance test), and (4) 
      perceptions of the shoes (Monitor Orthopaedic Shoes questionnaire). Participants 
      were more stable during standing and walking in minimal shoes than in 
      conventional shoes, independent of visual or walking condition. Minimal shoes 
      were more beneficial for mobility than conventional shoes and barefoot. This 
      study supports the need for longitudinal studies investigating whether minimal 
      footwear is more beneficial for fall prevention in older people than conventional 
      footwear.

TI  - Physiological Parameter Response to Variation of Mental Workload.
PG  - 31-56
LID - 10.1177/0018720817733101 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between experienced mental workload and 
      physiological response by noninvasive monitoring of physiological parameters. 
      BACKGROUND: Previous studies have examined how individual physiological measures 
      respond to changes in mental demand and subjective reports of workload. This 
      study explores the response of multiple physiological parameters and quantifies 
      their added value when estimating the level of demand. METHOD: The study 
      presented was conducted in laboratory conditions and required participants to 
      perform a visual-motor task that imposed varying levels of demand. The data 
      collected consisted of physiological measurements (heart interbeat intervals, 
      breathing rate, pupil diameter, facial thermography), subjective ratings of 
      workload (Instantaneous Self-Assessment Workload Scale [ISA] and NASA-Task Load 
      Index), and the performance. RESULTS: Facial thermography and pupil diameter were 
      demonstrated to be good candidates for noninvasive workload measurements: For 
      seven out of 10 participants, pupil diameter showed a strong correlation ( R 
      values between .61 and .79 at a significance value of .01) with mean ISA 
      normalized values. Facial thermography measures added on average 47.7% to the 
      amount of variability in task performance explained by a regression model. As 
      with the ISA ratings, the relationship between the physiological measures and 
      performance showed strong interparticipant differences, with some individuals 
      demonstrating a much stronger relationship between workload and performance 
      measures than others. CONCLUSION: The results presented in this paper demonstrate 
      that physiological and pupil diameter can be used for noninvasive real-time 
      measurement of workload. APPLICATION: The methods presented in this article, with 
      current technological capabilities, are better suited for workplaces where the 
      person is seated, offering the possibility of being applied to pilots and air 
      traffic controllers.

TI  - Cognitive Resource Demands of Redirected Walking.
PG  - 539-44
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2015.2391864 [doi]
AB  - Redirected walking allows users to walk through a large-scale immersive virtual 
      environment (IVE) while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. 
      Therefore, manipulations are applied to virtual camera motions so that the user's 
      self-motion in the virtual world differs from movements in the real world. 
      Previous work found that the human perceptual system tolerates a certain amount 
      of inconsistency between proprioceptive, vestibular and visual sensation in IVEs, 
      and even compensates for slight discrepancies with recalibrated motor commands. 
      Experiments showed that users are not able to detect an inconsistency if their 
      physical path is bent with a radius of at least 22 meters during virtual 
      straightforward movements. If redirected walking is applied in a smaller 
      workspace, manipulations become noticeable, but users are still able to move 
      through a potentially infinitely large virtual world by walking. For this 
      semi-natural form of locomotion, the question arises if such manipulations impose 
      cognitive demands on the user, which may compete with other tasks in IVEs for 
      finite cognitive resources. In this article we present an experiment in which we 
      analyze the mutual influence between redirected walking and verbal as well as 
      spatial working memory tasks using a dual-tasking method. The results show an 
      influence of redirected walking on verbal as well as spatial working memory 
      tasks, and we also found an effect of cognitive tasks on walking behavior. We 
      discuss the implications and provide guidelines for using redirected walking in 
      virtual reality laboratories.

TI  - Role of the National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups in 13 European 
      countries in the decision-making process on vaccine recommendations.
LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.43.2300131 [doi]
LID - 2300131
AB  - In Europe, National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) were 
      established in most countries to promote evidence-informed decision-making in 
      introducing new or improved vaccines or changing recommendations for existing 
      ones. Still, the role, activities and outcomes of NITAGs have not been optimally 
      implemented across Europe. Within the European Joint Action on Vaccination 
      (EU-JAV), we conducted a survey to collect information on decision-making process 
      including the main criteria for the introduction of new vaccines or changes to 
      recommendations on their use. Between December 2021 and January 2022, 13 of the 
      28 European countries invited participated in an online survey. The criteria 
      ranked as most relevant were disease burden and availability of financial 
      resources. Only one country specified that the NITAG recommendations were binding 
      for the government or the health authority. Vaccinations more often reported for 
      introduction or recommendation changes were those against herpes zoster, 
      influenza, human papillomavirus infection, pneumococcal and meningococcal 
      disease. The planned changes will mainly address children and adolescents 
      (2-18â¯years) and adults (â¥â¯45-65â¯years). Our findings show potential overlaps in 
      the activities of NITAGs between countries; and therefore, collaboration between 
      NITAGs may lead to optimisation of the workload and better use of resources.

TI  - The Segregation and Integration of Distinct Brain Networks and Their Relationship 
      to Cognition.
PG  - 12083-12094
AB  - A critical feature of the human brain that gives rise to complex cognition is its 
      ability to reconfigure its network structure dynamically and adaptively in 
      response to the environment. Existing research probing task-related 
      reconfiguration of brain network structure has concluded that, although there are 
      many similarities in network structure during an intrinsic, resting state and 
      during the performance of a variety of cognitive tasks, there are meaningful 
      differences as well. In this study, we related intrinsic, resting state network 
      organization to reconfigured network organization during the performance of two 
      tasks: a sequence tapping task, which is thought to probe motor execution and 
      likely engages a single brain network, and an n-back task, which is thought to 
      probe working memory and likely requires coordination across multiple networks. 
      We implemented graph theoretical analyses using functional connectivity data from 
      fMRI scans to calculate whole-brain measures of network organization in healthy 
      young adults. We focused on quantifying measures of network segregation 
      (modularity, system segregation, local efficiency, number of provincial hub 
      nodes) and measures of network integration (global efficiency, number of 
      connector hub nodes). Using these measures, we found converging evidence that 
      local, within-network communication is critical for motor execution, whereas 
      integrative, between-network communication is critical for working memory. These 
      results confirm that the human brain has the remarkable ability to reconfigure 
      its large-scale organization dynamically in response to current cognitive demands 
      and that interpreting reconfiguration in terms of network segregation and 
      integration may shed light on the optimal network structures underlying 
      successful cognition. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The dynamic nature of the human 
      brain gives rise to the wide range of behaviors and cognition of which humans are 
      capable. We collected fMRI data from healthy young adults and measured 
      large-scale functional connectivity patterns between regions distributed across 
      the entire brain. We implemented graph theoretical analyses to quantify network 
      organization during two tasks hypothesized to require different combinations of 
      brain networks. During motor execution, segregation of distinct networks 
      increased. Conversely, during working memory, integration across networks 
      increased. These changes in network organization were related to better 
      behavioral performance. These results underscore the human brain's ability to 
      reconfigure network organization selectively and adaptively when confronted with 
      changing cognitive demands to achieve an optimal balance between segregation and 
      integration.

AB  - Because both development and context impact functional brain architecture, the 
      neural connectivity signature of a cognitive or affective predisposition may 
      similarly vary across different ages and circumstances. To test this hypothesis, 
      we investigated the effects of age and cognitive versus social-affective context 
      on the stable and time-varying neural architecture of inhibition, the putative 
      core cognitive control component, in a subsample (N = 359, 22-36 years, 174 men) 
      of the Human Connectome Project. Among younger individuals, a neural signature of 
      superior inhibition emerged in both stable and dynamic connectivity analyses. 
      Dynamically, a context-free signature emerged as stronger segregation of internal 
      cognition (default mode) and environmentally driven control (salience, 
      cingulo-opercular) systems. A dynamic social-affective context-specific signature 
      was observed most clearly in the visual system. Stable connectivity analyses 
      revealed both context-free (greater default mode segregation) and 
      context-specific (greater frontoparietal segregation for higher cognitive load; 
      greater attentional and environmentally driven control system segregation for 
      greater reward value) signatures of inhibition. Superior inhibition in more 
      mature adulthood was typified by reduced segregation in the default network with 
      increasing reward value and increased ventral attention but reduced 
      cingulo-opercular and subcortical system segregation with increasing cognitive 
      load. Failure to evidence this neural profile after the age of 30 predicted 
      poorer life functioning. Our results suggest that distinguishable neural 
      mechanisms underlie individual differences in cognitive control during different 
      young adult stages and across tasks, thereby underscoring the importance of 
      better understanding the interplay among dispositional, developmental, and 
      contextual factors in shaping adaptive versus maladaptive patterns of thought and 
      behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The brain's functional architecture changes 
      across different contexts and life stages. To test whether the neural signature 
      of a trait similarly varies, we investigated cognitive versus social-affective 
      context effects on the stable and time-varying neural architecture of inhibition 
      during a period of neurobehavioral fine-tuning (age 22-36 years). Younger 
      individuals with superior inhibition showed distinguishable context-free and 
      context-specific neural profiles, evidenced in both static and dynamic 
      connectivity analyses. More mature individuals with superior inhibition evidenced 
      only context-specific profiles, revealed in the static connectivity patterns 
      linked to increased reward or cognitive load. Delayed expression of this profile 
      predicted poorer life functioning. Our results underscore the importance of

TI  - Employer representatives' experiences of supporting employees with cognitive 
      impairments in a digital work environment.
PG  - 1343-1356
LID - 10.3233/WOR-230690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital work poses cognitive demands on all employees, but the impact 
      is greater for employees with cognitive impairments. Digitalization also has 
      significant implications for employer representatives as they are responsible for 
      the work environment. However, knowledge is scarce concerning employer 
      representatives' perspectives on identifying needs and support for employees with 
      cognitive impairments working in a digital work environment. OBJECTIVE: To 
      describe employer representatives' experiences of work environment management 
      with focus on employees with cognitive impairments working in a digital 
      environment. METHODS: Focus group methodology was used. Six employer 
      representatives with work environment responsibilities participated. RESULTS: One 
      overall theme "Mastering the interconnected processes in a transformative digital 
      work environment" as well as three themes "Facilitating good digital work 
      conditions", "Identifying needs and difficulties in work tasks among employees' 
      with cognitive impairments" and "Pursuing knowledge and collaborations to support 
      employees with cognitive impairments" with subthemes were identified. The themes 
      describe employer representatives' challenges and efforts to identify fluctuating 
      needs in employees with cognitive impairments and, also, to organize and reduce 
      cognitive demands in the work environment to support them. CONCLUSIONS: Managing 
      the challenges of an evolving digital work environment and matching individual 
      work ability of employees with cognitive impairments in relation to cognitive 
      demands is an ongoing process. The participants valued cooperation with employees 
      with cognitive impairments but lacked support from expertise. The need to develop 
      and implement a functioning support system for vocational rehabilitation to 
      ensure a sustainable work in digital work environments is indicated.

LID - 10.3390/s20010039 [doi]
LID - 39
AB  - In this work, authors address workload computation combining human activity 
      recognition and heart rate measurements to establish a scalable framework for 
      health at work and fitness-related applications. The proposed architecture 
      consists of two wearable sensors: one for motion, and another for heart rate. The 
      system employs machine learning algorithms to determine the activity performed by 
      a user, and takes a concept from ergonomics, the Frimat's score, to compute the 
      corresponding physical workload from measured heart rate values providing in 
      addition a qualitative description of the workload. A random forest activity 
      classifier is trained and validated with data from nine subjects, achieving an 
      accuracy of 97.5%. Then, tests with 20 subjects show the reliability of the 
      activity classifier, which keeps an accuracy up to 92% during real-time testing. 
      Additionally, a single-subject twenty-day physical workload tracking case study 
      evinces the system capabilities to detect body adaptation to a custom exercise 
      routine. The proposed system enables remote and multi-user workload monitoring, 
      which facilitates the job for experts in ergonomics and workplace health.

AB  - Information visualizations may be evaluated from the perspective of how they 
      match tasks that must be performed with them, a cognitive fit perspective. 
      However, there is a gap between the high-level references made to cognitive fit 
      and the low-level ability to identify and measure it during human interaction 
      with visualizations. We bridge this gap by using an electroencephalography metric 
      derived from frontal midline theta power and parietal alpha power, known as the 
      task load index, to determine if cognitive effort measured at the level of 
      cortical activity is less when cognitive fit is present compared to when 
      cognitive fit is not. We found that when there is cognitive fit between the type 
      of problem to be solved and the information displayed by a system, the task load 
      index is lower compared to when cognitive fit is not present. We support this 
      finding with subjective (NASA task load index) and performance (response time and 
      accuracy) measures. Our approach, using electroencephalography, provides 
      supplemental information to self-report and performance measures. Findings from 
      this study are important because they (1) provide more validity to the cognitive 
      fit theory using a neurophysiological measure, and (2) use the 
      electroencephalography task load index metric as a means to assess cognitive 
      workload and effort in general.

TI  - At the core of reasoning: Dissociating deductive and non-deductive load.
PG  - 1850-1861
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23979 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, neuroimaging methods have been used to investigate how the human 
      mind carries out deductive reasoning. According to some, the neural substrate of 
      language is integral to deductive reasoning. According to others, deductive 
      reasoning is supported by a language-independent distributed network including 
      left frontopolar and frontomedial cortices. However, it has been suggested that 
      activity in these frontal regions might instead reflect non-deductive factors 
      such as working memory load and general cognitive difficulty. To address this 
      issue, 20 healthy volunteers participated in an fMRI experiment in which they 
      evaluated matched simple and complex deductive and non-deductive arguments in a 
      2 Ã 2 design. The contrast of complex versus simple deductive trials resulted in 
      a pattern of activation closely matching previous work, including frontopolar and 
      frontomedial "core" areas of deduction as well as other "cognitive support" areas 
      in frontoparietal cortices. Conversely, the contrast of complex and simple 
      non-deductive trials resulted in a pattern of activation that does not include 
      any of the aforementioned "core" areas. Direct comparison of the load effect 
      across deductive and non-deductive trials further supports the view that activity 
      in the regions previously interpreted as "core" to deductive reasoning cannot 
      merely reflect non-deductive load, but instead might reflect processes specific 
      to the deductive calculus. Finally, consistent with previous reports, the 
      classical language areas in left inferior frontal gyrus and posterior temporal 
      cortex do not appear to participate in deductive inference beyond their role in 
      encoding stimuli presented in linguistic format.

TI  - Contributing factors to errors in Swedish emergency departments.
PG  - 156-61

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Emergency Department (ED) is a complex and dynamic environment, 
      often resulting in a somewhat uncontrolled and unpredictable workload. 
      Contributing factors to errors in health care and in the ED are largely related 
      to communication breakdowns. Moreover, the ED work environment is predisposed to 
      multitasking, overcrowding and interruptions. These factors are assumed to have a 
      negative impact on patient safety. Reported errors from care providers are mainly 
      related to diagnostic procedures in Swedish EDs. However, there is a lack of 
      knowledge and national oversight regarding contributing factors. The aim of this 
      study was therefore to describe contributing factors in regards to errors 
      occurring in Swedish EDs. METHOD: Descriptive design based on registry data from 
      the Lex Maria database of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. 
      RESULTS: The results indicate that factors contributing to errors in Swedish EDs 
      are multifactorial in nature. The most common contributing factor was human error 
      followed by factors in the local ED environment and teamwork failure. CONCLUSION: 
      Factors contributing to ED errors were multifactorial and included both 
      organizational and teamwork failure in which human error was implicated. To 
      reduce errors, further research is needed to develop methods that disclose latent 
      working conditions such as high workload and interruptions. Patient safety 
      research needs to include understanding of human behaviour in complex 
      organizational systems and the impact of working conditions on patient safety and 
      quality of care.

TI  - Implementation assessment of a patient personalized clinical pharmacy programme 
      (5P project) into orthogeriatric care pathway.
PG  - 956-963
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13627 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The orthogeriatric path (hip-fractured elderly 
      patients) is composed of several transition points (emergency surgery, 
      orthopaedic, geriatric and rehabilitation units). The intervention of clinical 
      pharmacists can ensure the continuity of patients' drug management during their 
      hospital stay. The aim of the study was to assess the implementation of clinical 
      pharmacy activities in an orthogeriatric pathway, regarding its impact on 
      medication error prevention, the healthcare professionals' and patients' 
      satisfaction, and the estimated associated pharmaceutical workload. METHODS: 
      Participants were aged 75 or older and managed for proximal femoral fracture. 
      Their admission prescription was reviewed. If they were evaluated at high risk of 
      adverse event (AE), medication reconciliation (MedRec) and pharmaceutical 
      interviews (admission, discharge, and targeted on oral anticoagulant) were added 
      at different steps of their care pathway. The achievement and duration of each 
      clinical pharmacy activity were recorded. The number of pharmaceutical 
      interventions (PI) made during prescription review, and unintentional 
      discrepancies (UID) identified during MedRec were collected. A satisfaction 
      questionnaire was sent to patients and healthcare professionals. RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: Among 455 included patients, 284 patients were considered at high 
      risk of AE. Clinical pharmacy activity achievement rates varied between 12% and 
      98%. A total of 622 PI and 333 UID were identified. The overall patients' and 
      healthcare professionals' satisfaction was rated from 63% to 100%. The total 
      workload was estimated at 376 h: on average 16 min per prescription review, 
      43 min per admission MedRec, 26 min per discharge MedRec and 17 to 25 minutes per 
      interview. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the programme showed a high 
      potential of drug management securing. To sustain it, additional pharmaceutical 
      human resources and high-performance computing tools are needed.

TI  - From Theory to Practice: The Application of Cognitive Load Theory to the Practice 
      of Medicine.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000003524 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive load theory has become a leading model in educational psychology and 
      has started to gain traction in the medical education community over the last 
      decade. The theory is rooted in our current understanding of human cognitive 
      architecture in which an individual's limited working memory and unlimited 
      long-term memory interact during the process of learning. Though initially 
      described as primarily a theory of learning, parallels between cognitive load 
      theory and broader aspects of medical education as well as clinical practice are 
      now becoming clear. These parallels are particularly relevant and evident in 
      complex clinical environments, like resuscitation medicine. The authors have 
      built on these connections to develop a recontextualized version of cognitive 
      load theory that applies to complex professional domains and in which the 
      connections between the theory and clinical practice are made explicit, with 
      resuscitation medicine as a case study. Implications of the new model for medical 
      education are also presented along with suggested applications.

AB  - Cascading high-amplitude bursts in neural activity, termed avalanches, are 
      thought to provide insight into the complex spatially distributed interactions in 
      neural systems. In human neuroimaging, for example, avalanches occurring during 
      resting-state show scale-invariant dynamics, supporting the hypothesis that the 
      brain operates near a critical point that enables long range spatial 
      communication. In fact, it has been suggested that such scale-invariant dynamics, 
      characterized by a power-law distribution in these avalanches, are universal in 
      neural systems and emerge through a common mechanism. While the analysis of 
      avalanches and subsequent criticality is increasingly seen as a framework for 
      using complex systems theory to understand brain function, it is unclear how the 
      framework would account for the omnipresent cognitive variability, whether across 
      individuals or tasks. To address this, we analyzed avalanches in the EEG activity 
      of healthy humans during rest as well as two distinct task conditions that varied 
      in cognitive demands and produced behavioral measures unique to each individual. 
      In both rest and task conditions we observed that avalanche dynamics demonstrate 
      scale-invariant characteristics, but differ in their specific features, 
      demonstrating individual variability. Using a new metric we call normalized 
      engagement, which estimates the likelihood for a brain region to produce 
      high-amplitude bursts, we also investigated regional features of avalanche 
      dynamics. Normalized engagement showed not only the expected individual and task 
      dependent variability, but also scale-specificity that correlated with individual 
      behavior. Our results suggest that the study of avalanches in human brain 
      activity provides a tool to assess cognitive variability. Our findings expand our 
      understanding of avalanche features and are supportive of the emerging 
      theoretical idea that the dynamics of an active human brain operate close to a 
      critical-like region and not a singular critical-state.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Welders demonstrate a significant prevalence of work-related 
      musculoskeletal disorders as indicated by high rates of illness-related 
      absenteeism. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of a 24-week 
      exercise program on workload, physical performance, and overall health in 
      welders. METHODS: Seventy-seven professional welders were assigned to either a 
      control group (CG), an endurance training group (ETG), or a strength training 
      group (STG). Both groups conducted a 24-week, standardized and progressive 
      endurance or resistance exercise training program. Before (TP1) and after 
      training (TP2) all participants performed an experimental welding task (EWT) in 
      order to test the hypothesis that training would reduce the relative load (%MVC) 
      of eight skeletal muscles measured by surface electromyography. Secondary outcome 
      measures included further EWT-induced stress parameters and a series of 
      health-related outcome measures. RESULTS: Results revealed a lower muscle load in 
      participants of the ETG and STG for trapezius muscle at TP2 compared to T1 
      (P < .05 vs CG). Rate of perceived exertion and visual analogue scale were 
      decreased, while increase of maximum EWT duration was found in participants of 
      the ETG and STG after training (P < .05 vs CG). At T2, body fat (%) decreased and 
      physical performance (bicycle exercise test, isometric strength of core muscles) 
      increased in ETG and STG (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Both regular endurance and 
      strength training represent effective strategies for reducing workload and 
      improving physical performance of welders. The results emphasize the importance 
      of physical fitness for welders and might motivate health professionals in 
      steel-industry to offer access to exercise training programs.

AB  - There is a maldistribution of human resources for health globally, with many 
      Lower- and Middle-Income Countries experiencing significant shortages. We 
      examined healthcare workers' job preferences in South Africa to identify factors 
      which potentially influence employment decisions. A discrete choice experiment 
      was conducted among 855 South African healthcare workers critical to its national 
      HIV testing and treatment programs. Job characteristics included workload, 
      workplace culture, availability of equipment, training opportunities, sector and 
      facility type, location, salary and benefits. Main effects analysis was conducted 
      using fixed effects logistic regression. Interaction effects identified 
      divergence in preferences. Heavy workload (OR = 0.78; 95% C.I. 0.74-0.83), poor 
      workplace culture (odds ratio 0.66; 95% C.I. 0.62-0.69), insufficient 
      availability of equipment (OR = 0.67; 95% C.I. 0.63-0.70) and infrequent training 
      opportunities (OR = 0.75; 95% C.I. 0.71-0.80) had large, significant effects on 
      worker preferences. An increase in salary of 20% (OR = 1.29; 95% C.I. 1.16-1.44) 
      had a positive effect on preferences, while a salary decrease of 20% (OR = 0.55; 
      95% C.I. 0.49-0.60) had a strong negative effect. Benefits packages had large 
      positive effects on preferences: respondents were twice as likely to choose a job 
      that included medical aid, pension and housing contributions worth 40% of salary 
      (OR = 2.06; 95% C.I. 1.87-2.26), holding all else constant. Although salary was 
      important across all cadres, benefits packages had larger effects on job 
      preferences than equivalent salary increases. Improving working conditions is 
      critical to attracting and retaining appropriate health cadres responsible for 
      the country's HIV services, especially in the public sector and underserved, 
      often rural, communities. Crucially, our evidence suggests that factors amenable 
      to improvement such as workplace conditions and remuneration packages have a 
      greater influence on healthcare workers employment decisions than employment 
      sector or location.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prediction and evaluation of pilot workload is a key problem in 
      human factor airworthiness of cockpit. OBJECTIVE: A pilot traffic pattern task 
      was designed in a flight simulation environment in order to carry out the pilot 
      workload prediction and improve the evaluation method. METHODS: The prediction of 
      typical flight subtasks and dynamic workloads (cruise, approach, and landing) 
      were built up based on multiple resource theory, and a favorable validity was 
      achieved by the correlation analysis verification between sensitive physiological 
      data and the predicted value. RESULTS: Statistical analysis indicated that eye 
      movement indices (fixation frequency, mean fixation time, saccade frequency, mean 
      saccade time, and mean pupil diameter), Electrocardiogram indices (mean 
      normal-to-normal interval and the ratio between low frequency and sum of low 
      frequency and high frequency), and Electrodermal Activity indices (mean tonic and 
      mean phasic) were all sensitive to typical workloads of subjects. CONCLUSION: A 
      multinominal logistic regression model based on combination of physiological 
      indices (fixation frequency, mean normal-to-normal interval, the ratio between 
      low frequency and sum of low frequency and high frequency, and mean tonic) was 
      constructed, and the discriminate accuracy was comparatively ideal with a rate of 
      84.85%.

TI  - Pointing and tracing gestures may enhance anatomy and physiology learning.
PG  - 596-601
LID - 10.3109/0142159X.2014.899684 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, instructional effects generated by Cognitive load theory 
      (CLT) are limited to visual and auditory cognitive processing. In contrast, 
      "embodied cognition" perspectives suggest a range of gestures, including 
      pointing, may act to support communication and learning, but there is relatively 
      little research showing benefits of such "embodied learning" in the health 
      sciences. AIM: This study investigated whether explicit instructions to gesture 
      enhance learning through its cognitive effects. METHODS: Forty-two 
      university-educated adults were randomly assigned to conditions in which they 
      were instructed to gesture, or not gesture, as they learnt from novel, 
      paper-based materials about the structure and function of the human heart. 
      Subjective ratings were used to measure levels of intrinsic, extraneous and 
      germane cognitive load. RESULTS: Participants who were instructed to gesture 
      performed better on a knowledge test of terminology and a test of comprehension; 
      however, instructions to gesture had no effect on subjective ratings of cognitive 
      load. CONCLUSIONS: This very simple instructional re-design has the potential to 
      markedly enhance student learning of typical topics and materials in the health 
      sciences and medicine.

TI  - Faculty Perceptions of Workload: A Human Factor's Approach to Instrument 
      Development.
PG  - 56-76
LID - 10.1891/1061-3749.25.1.56 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Research revealed nursing faculty members' perceived 
      workload measures do not adequately capture the complexity of their workload. 
      Using a human factors approach to address the multiple complex dimensions from 
      the subjective perception of the worker, the Nurse Faculty Workload Assessment 
      (NFWA) was developed. METHODS: Survey data from 565 faculty members were used to 
      establish the instrument's psychometric properties. RESULTS: NWFA Sections 1, 2, 
      and 3 demonstrated reliability and internal consistency. Findings supported 
      interrelationships between activity complexity, performance circumstances, and 
      individual characteristics described in human factors workload literature. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The NFWA provides a tool for administrators to evaluate faculty 
      perception of workload expectations. Further study is needed to refine the NFWA 
      and to compare the perception of faculty regarding workload using various 
      workload formula calculations in various nursing programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the effect of advanced preparation and organisation of 
      equipment and drugs for Pre-hospital Emergency Anaesthesia (PHEA) and tracheal 
      intubation on procedural time, error rates, and cognitive load. METHODS: This 
      study was a randomised, controlled experiment with a crossover design. Clinical 
      teams (physician and paramedic) from the Emergency Medical Retrieval Service and 
      the Scottish Air Ambulance Division were randomised to perform a standardised 
      pre-hospital clinical simulation using either unprepared (standard practice) or 
      pre-prepared (experimental method) PHEA equipment and drugs. Following a two-week 
      washout period, each team performed the corresponding simulation. The primary 
      outcome was intervention time. Secondary outcomes were safety-related incidents 
      and errors, and degree of cognitive load. RESULTS: In total 23 experiments were 
      completed, 12 using experimental method and 11 using standard practice. Time 
      required to perform PHEA using the experimental method was significantly shorter 
      than with standard practice (11,45 versus 20:59) minutes: seconds; pâ=â<â0.001). 
      The experimental method also significantly reduced procedural errors (0 versus 9, 
      pâ=â0.007) and the cognitive load experienced by the intubator assistant (41.9 
      versus 68.7 mm, pâ=â0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-preparation of PHEA equipment and 
      drugs resulted in safer performance of PHEA and has the potential to reduce 
      on-scene time by up to a third.

TI  - Clinical consequences of computer-aided colorectal polyp detection.
PG  - 1974-1983
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2024-331943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Randomised trials show improved polyp detection with 
      computer-aided detection (CADe), mostly of small lesions. However, operator and 
      selection bias may affect CADe's true benefit. Clinical outcomes of increased 
      detection have not yet been fully elucidated. METHODS: In this multicentre trial, 
      CADe combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks was used for polyp 
      detection. Blinded endoscopists were monitored in real time by a second observer 
      with CADe access. CADe detections prompted reinspection. Adenoma detection rates 
      (ADR) and polyp detection rates were measured prestudy and poststudy. 
      Histological assessments were done by independent histopathologists. The primary 
      outcome compared polyp detection between endoscopists and CADe. RESULTS: In 946 
      patients (51.9% male, mean age 64), a total of 2141 polyps were identified, 
      including 989 adenomas. CADe was not superior to human polyp detection 
      (sensitivity 94.6% vs 96.0%) but outperformed them when restricted to adenomas. 
      Unblinding led to an additional yield of 86 true positive polyp detections (1.1% 
      ADR increase per patient; 73.8% were <5âmm). CADe also increased non-neoplastic 
      polyp detection by an absolute value of 4.9% of the cases (1.8% increase of 
      entire polyp load). Procedure time increased with 6.6Â±6.5âmin (+42.6%). In 22/946 
      patients, the additional detection of adenomas changed surveillance intervals 
      (2.3%), mostly by increasing the number of small adenomas beyond the cut-off. 
      CONCLUSION: Even if CADe appears to be slightly more sensitive than human 
      endoscopists, the additional gain in ADR was minimal and follow-up intervals 
      rarely changed. Additional inspection of non-neoplastic lesions was increased, 
      adding to the inspection and/or polypectomy workload.

TI  - Evaluation of absenteeism and presenteeism status of factory employees.
PG  - 449-457
LID - 10.3233/WOR-230642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While absenteeism refers to not attending work, presenteeism is 
      defined as not being present at work. These two conditions, which negatively 
      affect employee health, can be indicators of work efficiency, work peace, work 
      safety and work engagement. OBJECTIVE: Several factors were evaluated in this 
      study concerning absenteeism and presenteeism among factory workers. METHODS: 
      This cross-sectional study was conducted among workers in a factory operating in 
      a heavy industry in southern Turkey in 2021. A survey consisting of 57 questions 
      was applied to 152 factory workers by face-to-face interview method. The 
      participants' behaviour over the last month was evaluated regarding absenteeism 
      and presenteeism. RESULTS: It was reported that 24 (15.8%) of all employees were 
      absent from work in the last month (absenteeism), excluding holidays and sick 
      leave, and that 20 (13.2%) employees engaged in presenteeism, working when they 
      should not have been at the workplace. There was a high absenteeism rate among 
      employees who had an acute illness and were dissatisfied with their jobs. Several 
      factors have been associated with presenteeism, including poor economic 
      conditions, family health problems, previous unemployment, working overtime, job 
      dissatisfaction, poor relationships with colleagues and difficulty finding a 
      replacement, acute illness, sleep problems and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: To increase 
      the productivity and commitment of employees, it may be useful to identify the 
      reasons for absenteeism and present behaviours, to facilitate effective 
      interpersonal communication skills by examining the organisational climate of 
      employees, and to regulate workload based on a comprehensive assessment of the 
      health status of employees.

TI  - Activation-based association profiles differentiate network roles across 
      cognitive loads.
PG  - 2800-2812
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24561 [doi]
AB  - Working memory (WM) is a complex and pivotal cognitive system underlying the 
      performance of many cognitive behaviors. Although individual differences in WM 
      performance have previously been linked to the blood oxygenation level-dependent 
      (BOLD) response across several large-scale brain networks, the unique and shared 
      contributions of each large-scale brain network to efficient WM processes across 
      different cognitive loads remain elusive. Using a WM paradigm and functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from the Human Connectome Project, we proposed 
      a framework to assess the association and shared-association strength between 
      imaging biomarkers and behavioral scales. Association strength is the capability 
      of individual brain regions to modulate WM performance and shared-association 
      strength measures how different regions share the capability of modulating 
      performance. Under higher cognitive load (2-back), the frontoparietal executive 
      control network (FPN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network 
      showed significant positive activation and positive associations, whereas the 
      default mode network (DMN) showed the opposite pattern, namely, significant 
      deactivation and negative associations. Comparing the different cognitive loads, 
      the DMN and FPN showed predominant associations and globally shared-associations. 
      When investigating the differences in association from lower to higher cognitive 
      loads, the DAN demonstrated enhanced association strength and globally 
      shared-associations, which were significantly greater than those of the other 
      networks. This study characterized how brain regions individually and 
      collaboratively support different cognitive loads.

TI  - The Effects of Event Rate on a Cognitive Vigilance Task.
PG  - 440-450
LID - 10.1177/0018720818790840 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present experiment sought to examine the effects of event rate on 
      a cognitive vigilance task. BACKGROUND: Vigilance, or the ability to sustain 
      attention, is an integral component of human factors research. Vigilance task 
      difficulty has previously been manipulated through increasing event rate. 
      However, most research in this paradigm has utilized a sensory-based task, 
      whereas little work has focused on these effects in relation to a cognitive-based 
      task. METHOD: In sum, 84 participants completed a cognitive vigilance task that 
      contained either 24 events per minute (low event rate condition) or 40 events per 
      minute (high event rate condition). Performance was measured through the 
      proportion of hits, false alarms, mean response time, and signal detection 
      analyses (i.e., sensitivity and response bias). Additionally, measures of 
      perceived workload and stress were collected. RESULTS: The results indicated that 
      event rate significantly affected performance, such that participants who 
      completed the low event rate task achieved significantly better performance in 
      terms of correction detections and false alarms. Furthermore, the cognitive vigil 
      utilized in the present study produced performance decrements comparable to 
      traditional sensory vigilance tasks. CONCLUSION: Event rate affects cognitive 
      vigilance tasks in a similar manner as traditional sensory vigilance tasks, such 
      that a direct relation between performance and level of event rate was 
      established. APPLICATION: Cognitive researchers wishing to manipulate task 
      difficulty in their experiments may use event rate presentation as one avenue to 
      achieve this result.

AB  - Cognitive control, with a limited capacity, is a core process in human cognition 
      for the coordination of thoughts and actions. Although the regions involved in 
      cognitive control have been identified as the cognitive control network (CCN), it 
      is still unclear whether a specific region of the CCN serves as a bottleneck 
      limiting the capacity of cognitive control (CCC). Here, we used a perceptual 
      decision-making task with conditions of high cognitive load to challenge the CCN 
      and to assess the CCC in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. We found 
      that the activation of the right anterior insular cortex (AIC) of the CCN 
      increased monotonically as a function of cognitive load, reached its plateau 
      early, and showed a significant correlation to the CCC. In a subsequent study of 
      patients with unilateral lesions of the AIC, we found that lesions of the AIC 
      were associated with a significant impairment of the CCC. Simulated lesions of 
      the AIC resulted in a reduction of the global efficiency of the CCN in a network 
      analysis. These findings suggest that the AIC, as a critical hub in the CCN, is a 
      bottleneck of cognitive control.

TI  - Expression of VO2peak in Children and Youth, with Special Reference to Allometric 
      Scaling.

AB  - The aim of this review was to highlight research that has focused on examining 
      expressions of peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in children and youth, with special 
      reference to allometric scaling. VO2peak is considered the highest VO2 during an 
      increasing workload treadmill or bicycle ergometer test until volitional 
      termination. We have reviewed scholarly works identified from PubMed, One Search, 
      EBSCOhost and Google Scholar that examined VO2peak in absolute units (LÂ·min(-1)), 
      relative units [body mass, fat-free mass (FFM)], and allometric expressions 
      [mass, height, lean body mass (LBM) or LBM of the legs raised to a power 
      function] through July 2015. Often, the objective of measuring VO2peak is to 
      evaluate cardiorespiratory function and fitness level. Since body size (body mass 
      and height) frequently vary greatly in children and youth, expressing VO2peak in 
      dimensionless units is often inappropriate for comparative or explanatory 
      purposes. Consequently, expressing VO2peak in allometric units has gained 
      increased research attention over the past 2 decades. In our review, scaling mass 
      was the most frequent variable employed, with coefficients ranging from 
      approximately 0.30 to over 1.0. The wide variance is probably due to several 
      factors, including mass, height, LBM, sex, age, physical training, and small 
      sample size. In summary, we recommend that since skeletal muscle is paramount for 
      human locomotion, an allometric expression of VO2peak relative to LBM is the best 
      expression of VO2peak in children and youth.

AB  - Natural human behavior arises from continuous interactions between the cognitive 
      and motor domains. However, assessments of cognitive abilities are typically 
      conducted using pen and paper tests, i.e., in isolation from "real life" 
      cognitive-motor behavior and in artificial contexts. In the current study, we 
      aimed to assess cognitive-motor task performance in a more naturalistic setting 
      while recording multiple motor and eye tracking signals. Specifically, we aimed 
      to (i) delineate the contribution of cognitive and motor components to overall 
      task performance and (ii) probe for a link between cognitive-motor performance 
      and pupil size. To that end, we used a virtual reality (VR) adaptation of a 
      well-established neurocognitive test for executive functions, the 'Color Trails 
      Test' (CTT). The VR-CTT involves performing 3D reaching movements to follow a 
      trail of numbered targets. To tease apart the cognitive and motor components of 
      task performance, we included two additional conditions: a condition where 
      participants only used their eyes to perform the CTT task (using an eye tracking 
      device), incurring reduced motor demands, and a condition where participants 
      manually tracked visually-cued targets without numbers on them, incurring reduced 
      cognitive demands. Our results from a group of 30 older adults (>65) showed that 
      reducing cognitive demands shortened completion times more extensively than 
      reducing motor demands. Conditions with higher cognitive demands had longer 
      target search time, as well as decreased movement execution velocity and 
      head-hand coordination. We found larger pupil sizes in the more cognitively 
      demanding conditions, and an inverse correlation between pupil size and 
      completion times across individuals in all task conditions. Lastly, we found a 
      possible link between VR-CTT performance measures and clinical signatures of 
      participants (fallers versus non-fallers). In summary, performance and pupil 
      parameters were mainly dependent on task cognitive load, while maintaining 
      systematic interindividual differences. We suggest that this paradigm opens the 
      possibility for more detailed profiling of individual cognitive-motor performance 
      capabilities in older adults and other at-risk populations.

AB  - Previous work focused on cognitive workload assessment suggests EEG spectral 
      content and component amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform 
      may index mental effort and attentional reserve, respectively. Although few 
      studies have assessed attentional reserve and mental effort during 
      upper-extremity performance, none have employed a combined approach to measure 
      cognitive workload during locomotion. Therefore, by systematically considering 
      ERPs, spectral content and importantly their combination, this study aimed to 
      examine whether concurrent changes in spectral content and ERPs could 
      collectively serve as an index of cognitive workload during locomotion. 
      Specifically, ERP and EEG biomarkers were assessed as participants performed a 
      cognitive task under two levels of difficulty (easy or hard) and two conditions 
      (seated or walking). Changes in attentional reserve and mental effort appeared to 
      collectively index cognitive workload under varying demands due to changes in 
      task difficulty or performance conditions. This work can inform cognitive 
      workload assessment in patient populations with gait deficiencies for future 
      applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Work-related stress is a common risk factor among healthcare workers 
      (HCWs). In Iran, the healthcare system has undergone extensive changes to develop 
      services. Organisational change has led to the creation of new working conditions 
      for HCWs. The purpose of this study is to identify job demands that health 
      workers perceive as stressors. DESIGN: As a qualitative study, semistructured 
      interviews, a focus group, and related data were analysed both inductively and 
      deductively with reference to the job demand component based on the job 
      demands-resources model and MAXQDA. SETTING: This investigation was conducted in 
      18 primary healthcare centres in Qazvin, Iran. PARTICIPANT: Twenty-one female 
      HCWs with at least 6 months of work experience and an average age of 34.4 years. 
      RESULTS: The participants identified six key elements as the stressful job 
      demands including organisation's supervisory function, role characteristics, 
      workload, job insecurity, client service challenges and perceived job content. 
      CONCLUSIONS: After organisational changes and development, HCWs were faced with 
      role changes and increased workload. In addition, organisational supervision in 
      terms of quantity and quality and lack of job security intensified the pressures. 
      These factors led to the high level of stress among employees who dealt with 
      people and those who perceived their job content as unfavourable. Perhaps 
      teaching stress control skills and organisational support interventions can be 
      useful to reduce and control stress among HCWs.

AB  - The line bisection task is commonly depicted as a valid diagnostic tool to help 
      differentiate between primary visual field defects and spatial neglect. However, 
      recent studies have addressed possible drawbacks in the acute phase after stroke 
      onset. We investigated these critical assumptions in a large and homogeneous 
      sample of 180 acute stroke patients. Line bisection, cancellation performance, 
      copying, and primary visual field defects were assessed in 180 acute 
      right-hemispheric stroke patients. Effects of visual field defects and concurrent 
      spatial neglect on line bisection were analyzed by multiple regression to account 
      for possible additive and interactive effects. The relation between line 
      bisection and other tests applied in spatial neglect was explored by factorial 
      analysis. We found no evidence for the existence of a contralesional 'hemianopic 
      line bisection error' in acute patients with primary visual field defects. Such 
      patients even showed a more pronounced ipsilesional line bisection error. Second, 
      the factorial analysis revealed that the line bisection task on the one hand and 
      cancellation/copying tasks on the other were represented by different factors, 
      indicating that they make different cognitive demands. In the acute phase of 
      stroke, line bisection does not appear to be a valid task to diagnose neither 
      primary visual field defects nor spatial neglect (the latter as defined by its 
      core symptoms (cf., Karnath and Rorden, 2012) which are typically captured with 
      cancellation/copying tasks).

AB  - BACKGROUND: To understand how surgeon expectation of case difficulty relates to 
      workload for colon and rectal procedures and to identify possible 
      surgeon-perceived drivers contributing to case difficulty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      For 3 mo, surgeons were asked to complete a modified NASA-Task Load Index 
      (NASA-TLX) questionnaire following each surgical case. Questions included items 
      on distractions, fatigue, procedural difficulty, and expectation plus the 
      validated NASA-TLX items. All but expectation were rated on a 20-point scale 
      (0 = low, 20 = high). Expectation was rated on a 3-point scale (i.e., more 
      difficult than expected, as expected, less difficult than expected). Surgeons 
      also reported perceived drivers contributing to case ease or difficulty. Patient 
      and procedural data were analyzed for procedures with completed surveys. RESULTS: 
      Seven surgeons (three female) rated 122 procedures over the research period using 
      a modified NASA-TLX survey. Mean surgeon-perceived workload was highest for 
      effort (mean [M] = 10.83, standard deviation [SD] = 5.66) followed by mental 
      demand (M = 10.18, SD = 5.17), and physical demand (M = 9.19, SD = 5.60). 
      Procedural difficulty varied significantly by procedure type (P < 0.001). 
      Thirty-five percent of cases were considered more difficult than expected. 
      Surgeon-perceived workload and most subscales differed significantly according to 
      expectation level. There was no significant difference in patient factors by 
      expectation level. Surgeons most frequently reported patient anatomy, body 
      habitus, and operative team characteristics as drivers to difficulty and ease of 
      cases. CONCLUSIONS: Procedural difficulty significantly differed across procedure 
      type. More than one-third of cases were more difficult than expected, during 
      which surgeons attributed this to operative team characteristics as well as 
      issues in patient anatomy and body habitus.

AB  - Vigilance, or sustained attention, is the ability to maintain attention for 
      prolonged periods of time. Interestingly, to date, few studies on vigilance have 
      focused on the role of state motivation in sustaining attention. To address this 
      disparity in the literature, the present study examined the effect of two types 
      of state motivation on vigilance performance across task types (cognitive or 
      sensory) and across the number of displays (one, two, or four). A sample of 105 
      participants completed a 24-min overload or underload vigilance task in a 
      research laboratory. Participants were randomly assigned to either a cognitive or 
      sensory vigilance task, and were randomly assigned to monitor one, two, or four 
      displays for target stimuli. The results indicated that intrinsic state 
      motivation predicted correct detection performance and state success motivation 
      predicted sensitivity, but not false alarm performance, response bias, or global 
      workload. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical 
      applications of this research.

TI  - Assessing workload in neuropsychology: An illustration with the Tower of Hanoi 
      test.
PG  - 1022-1029
LID - 10.1080/13803395.2018.1473343 [doi]
AB  - Workload is a common and useful construct in human factors research that has been 
      largely overlooked in other areas of psychology, including neuropsychology, where 
      it could be effectively employed both theoretically and practically. A popular 
      subjective measure of workload, the NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), is 
      illustrated with a computerized version of the Tower of Hanoi (TOH), a typical 
      neuropsychological test of executive function. Reported workload, especially as 
      an overall measure and also for the Mental Demand and Effort subscales, was 
      greater in the more difficult TOH conditions and was positively correlated with 
      number of moves to complete the TOH as well as completion time. Thus, results 
      support the utility or construct validity of the NASA-TLX in reflecting workload 
      states in the individual as well as various demands of the neuropsychological 
      test (the timing, physical demands, etc.). It is argued that workload can be a 
      useful construct in neuropsychological assessment, providing an additional 
      channel of information on patient status. For instance, what does it mean if test 
      performance for a patient is at a typical level (indicating no deficit) but 
      workload is exceptionally high?

AB  - We first tested the effect of differing tactile informational forms (i.e. 
      directional cues vs. static cues vs. dynamic cues) on objective performance and 
      perceived workload in a collaborative human-robot task. A second experiment 
      evaluated the influence of task load and informational message type (i.e. single 
      words vs. grouped phrases) on that same collaborative task. In both experiments, 
      the relationship of personal characteristics (attentional control and spatial 
      ability) to performance and workload was also measured. In addition to objective 
      performance and self-report of cognitive load, we evaluated different 
      physiological responses in each experiment. Results showed a performance-workload 
      association for directional cues, message type and task load. EEG measures 
      however, proved generally insensitive to such task load manipulations. Where 
      significant EEG effects were observed, right hemisphere amplitude differences 
      predominated, although unexpectedly these latter relationships were negative. 
      Although EEG measures were partially associated with performance, they appear to 
      possess limited utility as measures of workload in association with tactile 
      displays. Practitioner Summary: As practitioners look to take advantage of 
      innovative tactile displays in complex operational realms like human-robotic 
      interaction, associated performance effects are mediated by cognitive workload. 
      Despite some patterns of association, reliable reflections of operator state can 
      be difficult to discern and employ as the number, complexity and sophistication 
      of these respective measures themselves increase.

AB  - Brake reaction time is a key component to studying driving performance and 
      evaluating fitness to drive. Although commercial simulators can measure brake 
      reaction time, their cost remains a major barrier to clinical access. Therefore, 
      we developed open-source software written in C-sharp (C#) for measuring driving 
      related reaction times, which includes a subject-controlled vehicle with 
      straight-line dynamics and several testing scenarios. The software measures both 
      simple and cognitive load based reaction times and can use any human interface 
      device compliant steering wheel and pedals. Measures from the software were 
      validated against a commercial simulator and tested for reproducibility. Further, 
      experiments were performed using hand controls in both able-bodied and spinal 
      cord injured patients to determine clinical feasibility for disabled populations. 
      The software demonstrated high validity when measuring brake reaction times, 
      showed excellent test-retest reliability, and was sensitive enough to determine 
      significant brake reaction time differences between able-bodied and spinal cord 
      injured subjects. These results indicate that the proposed simulator is a simple 
      and feasible low-cost solution to perform brake reaction time tests and evaluate 
      fitness to drive.

LID - 10.1037/xhp0000085 [doi]
AB  - Current theoretical models and empirical research suggest that sensorimotor 
      control and feedback processes may guide time perception and production. In the 
      current study, we investigated the role of motor control and auditory feedback in 
      an interval-production task performed under heightened cognitive load. We 
      hypothesized that general associative learning mechanisms enable the calibration 
      of time against patterns of dynamic change in motor control processes and 
      auditory feedback information. In Experiment 1, we applied a dual-task 
      interference paradigm consisting of a finger-tapping (continuation) task in 
      combination with a working memory task. Participants (nonmusicians) had to either 
      perform or avoid arm movements between successive key presses (continuous vs. 
      discrete). Auditory feedback from a key press (a piano tone) filled either the 
      complete duration of the target interval or only a small part (long vs. short). 
      Results suggested that both continuous movement control and long piano feedback 
      tones contributed to regular timing production. In Experiment 2, we gradually 
      adjusted the duration of the long auditory feedback tones throughout the duration 
      of a trial. The results showed that a gradual shortening of tones throughout time 
      increased the rate at which participants performed tone onsets. Overall, our 
      findings suggest that the human perceptual-motor system may be important in 
      guiding temporal behavior under cognitive load.

TI  - A Precuneal Causal Loop Mediates External and Internal Information Integration in 
      the Human Brain.

AB  - Human brains interpret external stimuli based on internal representations. One 
      untested hypothesis is that the default-mode network (DMN), widely considered 
      responsible for internally oriented cognition, can decode external information. 
      Here, we posit that the unique structural and functional fingerprint of the 
      precuneus (PCu) supports a prominent role for the posterior part of the DMN in 
      this process. By analyzing the imaging data of 100 participants performing two 
      attention-demanding tasks, we found that the PCu is functionally divided into 
      dorsal and ventral subdivisions. We then conducted a comprehensive examination of 
      their connectivity profiles and found that at rest, both the ventral PCu (vPCu) 
      and dorsal PCu (dPCu) are mainly connected with the DMN but also are 
      differentially connected with internally oriented networks (IoN) and externally 
      oriented networks (EoN). During tasks, the double associations between the v/dPCu 
      and the IoN/EoN are correlated with task performance and can switch depending on 
      cognitive demand. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) revealed that the 
      strength and direction of the effective connectivity (EC) between v/dPCu is 
      modulated by task difficulty in a manner potentially dictated by the balance of 
      internal versus external cognitive demands. Our study provides evidence that the 
      posterior medial part of the DMN may drive interactions between large-scale 
      networks, potentially allowing access to stored representations for 
      moment-to-moment interpretation of an ever-changing environment.SIGNIFICANCE 
      STATEMENT The default-mode network (DMN) is widely known for its association with 
      internalized thinking processes, e.g., spontaneous thoughts, which is the most 
      interesting but least understood component in human consciousness. The precuneus 
      (PCu), a posteromedial DMN hub, is thought to play a role in this, but a 
      mechanistic explanation has not yet been established. In this study we found that 
      the associations between ventral PCu (vPCu)/dorsal PCu (dPCu) subdivisions and 
      internally oriented network (IoN)/externally oriented network (EoN) are flexibly 
      modulated by cognitive demand and correlate with task performance. We further 
      propose that the recurrent causal connectivity between the ventral and dorsal PCu 
      supports conscious processing by constantly interpreting external information 
      based on an internal model, meanwhile updating the internal model with the 
      incoming information.

AB  - Mental workload is an important component in complex human-machine systems. The 
      limited applicability of empirical workload measures produces the need for 
      workload modeling and prediction methods. In the present study, a mental workload 
      prediction model is built on the basis of attentional resource allocation and 
      information processing to ensure pilots' accuracy and speed in understanding 
      large amounts of flight information on the cockpit display interface. Validation 
      with an empirical study of an abnormal attitude recovery task showed that this 
      model's prediction of mental workload highly correlated with experimental 
      results. This mental workload prediction model provides a new tool for optimizing 
      human factors interface design and reducing human errors.

AB  - The acquisition of sensory information about the world is a dynamic and 
      interactive experience, yet the majority of sensory research focuses on 
      perception without action and is conducted with participants who are passive 
      observers with very limited control over their environment. This approach allows 
      for highly controlled, repeatable experiments and has led to major advances in 
      our understanding of basic sensory processing. Typical human perceptual 
      experiences, however, are far more complex than conventional action-perception 
      experiments and often involve bi-directional interactions between perception and 
      action. Innovations in virtual reality (VR) technology offer an approach to close 
      this notable disconnect between perceptual experiences and experiments. VR 
      experiments can be conducted with a high level of empirical control while also 
      allowing for movement and agency as well as controlled naturalistic environments. 
      New VR technology also permits tracking of fine hand movements, allowing for 
      seamless empirical integration of perception and action. Here, we used VR to 
      assess how multisensory information and cognitive demands affect hand movements 
      while reaching for virtual targets. First, we manipulated the visibility of the 
      reaching hand to uncouple vision and proprioception in a task measuring accuracy 
      while reaching toward a virtual target (n = 20, healthy young adults). The 
      results, which as expected revealed multisensory facilitation, provided a rapid 
      and a highly sensitive measure of isolated proprioceptive accuracy. In the second 
      experiment, we presented the virtual target only briefly and showed that VR can 
      be used as an efficient and robust measurement of spatial memory (n = 18, healthy 
      young adults). Finally, to assess the feasibility of using VR to study perception 
      and action in populations with physical disabilities, we showed that the results 
      from the visual-proprioceptive task generalize to two patients with recent 
      cerebellar stroke. Overall, we show that VR coupled with hand-tracking offers an 
      efficient and adaptable way to study human perception and action.

TI  - Strength of Plantar- and Dorsiflexors Mediates Step Regularity During a High 
      Cognitive Load Situation in a Cross-sectional Cohort of Older and Younger Adults.
PG  - E45-E52
LID - 10.1519/JPT.0000000000000254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Completing simultaneous tasks while standing or walking 
      (ie, a high cognitive load situation [HCLS]) is inevitable in daily activities 
      and can lead to interference in task performances. Age-related physical and 
      cognitive changes may confound performance variability during HCLS in older and 
      younger adults. Identification of these confounding effects may reveal therapy 
      targets to maintain optimal physical function later in life. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the effect of increasing the difficulty levels of an 
      additional motor task and restricting visual information, on gait parameters in 
      younger and older adults while considering the effect of cognitive and physical 
      covariates. METHODS: Fifteen healthy younger and 14 healthy older adults were 
      asked to complete assessments of cognitive function, balance, and strength. They 
      were then asked to walk on a self-paced treadmill with or without carrying a 
      plastic tray. Opaqueness of the tray (vision) and the presence of water in 
      glasses placed on the tray (increasing task difficulty) were varied. Mean, 
      standard deviation, and regularity (sample entropy) of step width and length were 
      compared across conditions and groups using repeated-measures analyses of 
      variance with and without covariate analysis. Only significantly correlated 
      covariates of cognition, balance, and strength were entered into each model. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Older adults had greater step width irregularity compared 
      with younger adults across all conditions when controlling for concentric 
      plantar- and dorsiflexion strength. A decline in strength may likely alter 
      neuromuscular control of gait, specifically control of step width, which has been 
      associated with fall risk in older adults. Adjusting for the same covariates 
      revealed increased regularity of step length, as visual feedback from the feet 
      was restricted. Specifically, step length was more regular while carrying an 
      opaque tray compared with not carrying a tray. Visual restriction was a 
      contributing factor, which led to more predictable gait kinematics, indicating 
      the role of sensory information to enhance the adaptability during walking under 
      HCLS. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of the regularity behavior of human movement can 
      expand physical therapists' treatment approaches to promote further interactivity 
      and coordination across body systems that model behavior of healthy young 
      individuals. Targeting strength during therapy may provide additional benefits 
      for gait performance under HCLS.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Advances in technology are providing new forms of 
      human-computer interaction. The current study examined one form of human-computer 
      interaction, augmented reality (AR), whereby subjects train in the real-world 
      workspace with virtual objects projected by the computer. Motor performances were 
      compared with those obtained while subjects used a traditional human-computer 
      interaction, that is, a personal computer (PC) with a mouse. METHODS: Patients 
      used goal-directed arm movements to play AR and PC versions of the Fruit Ninja 
      video game. The 2 versions required the same arm movements to control the game 
      but had different cognitive demands. With AR, the game was projected onto the 
      desktop, where subjects viewed the game plus their arm movements simultaneously, 
      in the same visual coordinate space. In the PC version, subjects used the same 
      arm movements but viewed the game by looking up at a computer monitor. RESULTS: 
      Among 18 patients with chronic hemiparesis after stroke, the AR game was 
      associated with 21% higher game scores (P = .0001), 19% faster reaching times (P 
      = .0001), and 15% less movement variability (P = .0068), as compared to the PC 
      game. Correlations between game score and arm motor status were stronger with the 
      AR version. CONCLUSIONS: Motor performances during the AR game were superior to 
      those during the PC game. This result is due in part to the greater cognitive 
      demands imposed by the PC game, a feature problematic for some patients but 
      clinically useful for others. Mode of human-computer interface influences 
      rehabilitation therapy demands and can be individualized for patients.

AB  - Understanding the operator's cognitive workload is crucial for efficiency and 
      safety in human-machine systems. This study investigated how cognitive workload 
      modulates cardiac autonomic regulation during a standardized military simulator 
      flight. Military student pilots completed simulated flight tasks in a Hawk flight 
      simulator. Continuous electrocardiography was recorded to analyze time and 
      frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV). After the simulation, a flight 
      instructor used a standardized method to evaluate student pilot's individual 
      cognitive workload from video-recorded flight simulator data. Results indicated 
      that HRV was able to differentiate flight phases that induced varying levels of 
      cognitive workload; an increasing level of cognitive workload caused significant 
      decreases in many HRV variables, mainly reflecting parasympathetic deactivation 
      of cardiac autonomic regulation. In conclusion, autonomic physiological responses 
      can be used to examine reactions to increased cognitive workload during simulated 
      military flights. HRV could be beneficial in assessing individual responses to 
      cognitive workload and pilot performance during simulator training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of occupational footwear and workload on postural 
      stability has been studied previously to prevent fall-related workplace injuries. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of two types of 
      occupational footwear [steel-toed (SB) and tactical (TB) work boots] on human 
      balance, when exposed to physical workload. METHODS: Postural stability was 
      evaluated in eighteen male participants in the following conditions: eyes open 
      (EO), eyes closed (EC), eyes open unstable surface (EOU) and eyes closed unstable 
      surface (ECU). Postural sway parameters were analyzed using a 2Ã3 repeated 
      measures analysis of variance design [prior to (PRE) and twice post-workload 
      (POST1 & POST2) separated by 10 minutes of rest]. RESULTS: Findings revealed that 
      the use of SB resulted in greater postural stability, which could be attributed 
      to the design characteristics of these footwear and that postural stability was 
      negatively impacted immediately after the workload which could be attributed to 
      the physical exertions during the workload. However, significant differences were 
      limited to ECU with no visual and altered somatosensory feedback. CONCLUSION: 
      Design features on occupational footwear can aid postural stability while 
      physical exertional tasks can be detrimental. Findings can offer design and 
      work-rest scheduling suggestions to improve work safety.

TI  - Multimodal Integration and Vividness in the Angular Gyrus During Episodic 
      Encoding and Retrieval.
PG  - 4365-4374
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2102-18.2018 [doi]
AB  - Much evidence suggests that the angular gyrus (AnG) is involved in episodic 
      memory, but its precise role has yet to be determined. We examined two possible 
      accounts within the same experimental paradigm: the "cortical binding of 
      relational activity" (CoBRA) account (Shimamura, 2011), which suggests that the 
      AnG acts as a convergence zone that binds multimodal episodic features, and the 
      subjectivity account (Yazar et al., 2012), which implicates AnG involvement in 
      subjective mnemonic experience (such as vividness or confidence). fMRI was used 
      during both encoding and retrieval of paired associates. During study, female and 
      male human participants memorized picture-pairs of common objects (in the 
      unimodal task) or of an object-picture and an environmental sound (in the 
      crossmodal task). At test, they performed a cued-recall task and further 
      indicated the vividness of their memory. During retrieval, BOLD activation in the 
      AnG was greatest for vividly remembered associates, consistent with the 
      subjectivity account. During encoding, the same effect of vividness was found, 
      but this was further modulated by task: greater activations were associated with 
      subsequent recall in the crossmodal than the unimodal task. Therefore, encoding 
      data suggest an additional role to the AnG in crossmodal integration, consistent 
      with its role at retrieval proposed by CoBRA. These results resolve some of the 
      puzzles in the literature and indicate that the AnG can play different roles 
      during encoding and retrieval as determined by the cognitive demands posed by 
      different mnemonic tasks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We offer new insights into the 
      multiplicity of processes that are associated with angular gyrus (AnG) activation 
      during encoding and retrieval of newly formed memories. We used fMRI while human 
      participants learned and subsequently recalled pairs of objects presented to the 
      same sensory modality or to different modalities. We were able to show that the 
      AnG is involved when vivid memories are created and retrieved, as well as when 
      encoded information is integrated across different sensory modalities. These 
      findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of the AnG to our subjective 
      experience of remembering alongside its role in integrative processes that 
      promote subsequent memory.

AB  - Knowledge about intra-limb coordination (ILC) during challenging walking 
      conditions provides insight into the adaptability of central nervous system (CNS) 
      for controlling human gait. We assessed the effects of cognitive load and speed 
      on the pattern and variability of the ILC in young people during walking. Thirty 
      healthy young people (19 female and 11 male) participated in this study. They 
      were asked to perform 9 walking trials on a treadmill, including walking at three 
      paces (preferred, slower and faster) either without a cognitive task (single-task 
      walking) or while subtracting 1×³s or 3×³s from a random three-digit number (simple 
      and complex dual-task walking, respectively). Deviation phase (DP) and mean 
      absolute relative phase (MARP) values-indicators of variability and phase dynamic 
      of ILC, respectively-were calculated using the data collected by a motion capture 
      system. We used a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance for statistical 
      analysis. The results showed that cognitive load had a significant main effect on 
      DP of right shank-foot and thigh-shank, left shank-foot and pelvis-thigh 
      (p<0.05), and MARP of both thigh-shank segments (p<0.01). In addition, the main 
      effect of walking speed was significant on DP of all segments in each side and 
      MARP of both thigh-shank and pelvis-thigh segments (p<0.001). The interaction of 
      cognitive load and walking speed was only significant for MARP values of left 
      shank-foot and right pelvis-thigh (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). We suggest 
      that cognitive load and speed could significantly affect the ILC and variability 
      and phase dynamic during walking.

AB  - In a human-automation interaction study, automation assistance level (AL) was 
      investigated for its effects on operator performance in a dynamic, multi-tasking 
      environment. Participants supervised a convoy of manned and unmanned vehicles 
      traversing a simulated environment in three AL conditions, while maintaining 
      situation awareness and identifying targets. Operators' situation awareness, 
      target detection performance, workload and individual differences were evaluated. 
      Results show increasing AL generally improved task performance and decreased 
      perceived workload, however, differential effects due to operator spatial ability 
      and perceived attentional control were found. Eye-tracking measures were useful 
      in parsing out individual differences that subjective measures did not detect. At 
      the highest AL, participants demonstrated potentially complacent behaviour, 
      indicating task disengagement. Practitioner Summary: The effect of varying 
      automation assistance level (AL) on operator performance on multiple tasks were 
      examined in a within-subjects experiment. Findings indicated a moderate AL 
      improved performance, while higher levels encouraged complacent behaviour. 
      Effects due to individual differences suggest that effective AL depends on the 
      underlying characteristics of the operator.

TI  - Toward a tactile language for human-robot interaction: two studies of tacton 
      learning and performance.
PG  - 471-90
LID - 10.1177/0018720814548063 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility for 
      robot-to-human communication of a tactile language using a lexicon of 
      standardized tactons (tactile icons) within a sentence. BACKGROUND: Improvements 
      in autonomous systems technology and a growing demand within military operations 
      are spurring interest in communication via vibrotactile displays. Tactile 
      communication may become an important element of human-robot interaction (HRI), 
      but it requires the development of messaging capabilities approaching the 
      communication power of the speech and visual signals used in the military. 
      METHOD: In Experiment 1 (N = 38), we trained participants to identify sets of 
      directional, dynamic, and static tactons and tested performance and workload 
      following training. In Experiment 2 (N = 76), we introduced an extended training 
      procedure and tested participants' ability to correctly identify two-tacton 
      phrases. We also investigated the impact of multitasking on performance and 
      workload. Individual difference factors were assessed. RESULTS: Experiment 1 
      showed that participants found dynamic and static tactons difficult to learn, but 
      the enhanced training procedure in Experiment 2 produced competency in 
      performance for all tacton categories. Participants in the latter study also 
      performed well on two-tacton phrases and when multitasking. However, some 
      deficits in performance and elevation of workload were observed. Spatial ability 
      predicted some aspects of performance in both studies. CONCLUSIONS: Participants 
      may be trained to identify both single tactons and tacton phrases, demonstrating 
      the feasibility of developing a tactile language for HRI. APPLICATION: Tactile 
      communication may be incorporated into multi-modal communication systems for HRI. 
      It also has potential for human-human communication in challenging environments.

AB  - Converging electrophysiological evidence suggests that the alpha rhythm plays an 
      important and active role in cognitive processing. Here, we systematically 
      studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within 
      subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under 
      three experimental conditions - rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back 
      working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha 
      activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency 
      differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and 
      looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both 
      regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and 
      passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a 
      significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back 
      condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency 
      during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha 
      peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3 
      Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9 Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8 Hz. We also 
      measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest, 
      found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak 
      frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases 
      with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a 
      wider frequency range than the 8-12 Hz band many studies tend to include in their 
      analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results 
      against certain subjects and conditions.

TI  - The Complexity of Jokes Is Limited by Cognitive Constraints on Mentalizing.
PG  - 130-40
LID - 10.1007/s12110-015-9251-6 [doi]
AB  - Although laughter is probably of deep evolutionary origin, the telling of jokes, 
      being language-based, is likely to be of more recent origin within the human 
      lineage. In language-based communication, speaker and listener are engaged in a 
      process of mutually understanding each other's intentions (mindstates), with a 
      conversation minimally requiring three orders of intentionality. Mentalizing is 
      cognitively more demanding than non-mentalizing cognition, and there is a 
      well-attested limit at five orders in the levels of intentionality at which 
      normal adult humans can work. Verbal jokes commonly involve commentary on the 
      mindstates of third parties, and each such mindstate adds an additional level of 
      intentionality and its corresponding cognitive load. We determined the number of 
      mentalizing levels in a sample of jokes told by well-known professional comedians 
      and show that most jokes involve either three or five orders of intentionality on 
      the part of the comedian, depending on whether or not the joke involves other 
      individuals' mindstates. Within this limit there is a positive correlation 
      between increasing levels of intentionality and subjective ratings of how funny 
      the jokes are. The quality of jokes appears to peak when they include five or six 
      levels of intentionality, which suggests that audiences appreciate higher 
      mentalizing complexity whilst working within their natural cognitive constraints.

LID - 10.3357/AMHP.4894.2018 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An experiment in a program of research supporting the 
      sense-assess-augment (SAA) framework is described. The objective is to use 
      physiological measures to assess operator cognitive workload in remotely piloted 
      aircraft (RPA) operations, and provide augmentation to assist the operator in 
      times of high workload. In previous experiments, physiological measures were 
      identified that demonstrate sensitivity to changes in workload. The current 
      research solely focuses on the augmentation component of the SAA paradigm. This 
      line of research uses a realistic RPA simulation with varying levels of workload. 
      METHODS: Recruited from the Midwest region were 12 individuals (6 women) to 
      participate in the experiment. The subjects were trained to perform a 
      surveillance task and a tracking task using RPAs. There was also a secondary task 
      in which subjects were required to answer cognitive probes. A within subjects 
      factorial design was employed with three factors per task. Subjective workload 
      estimates were acquired using the NASA-TLX. Performance data were calculated 
      using a composite scoring algorithm. RESULTS: Augmentation significantly improved 
      performance and reduced workload in both tasks. In the surveillance task, 
      augmentation increased performance from 573.78 to 679.04. Likewise, augmentation 
      increased performance in the tracking task from 749.39 to 791.81. Augmentation 
      was more beneficial in high workload conditions than low workload conditions. 
      DISCUSSION: The increase in performance and decrease in workload associated with 
      augmentation is an important and anticipated finding. This suggests that 
      augmentation should only be provided when it is truly needed, especially if the 
      augmentation requires additional assets and/or resources.Gruenwald CM, Middendorf

TI  - Assessment of mental workload based on multi-physiological signals.

LID - 10.3233/THC-209008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental workload is one of the contributing factors to human errors in 
      road accidents or other potentially adverse incidents. OBJECTIVE: This research 
      probes the effects of mental workload on the electroencephalographic (EEG) and 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) of subjects in visual monitoring tasks, based on which a 
      comprehensive evaluation model for mental workload is established effectively. 
      METHODS: Three degrees of mental workload were obtained by monitoring tasks with 
      different levels of difficulty. 20 healthy subjects were selected to take part in 
      the research. RESULTS: The subjective scores showed a significant increase with 
      the increase of task difficulty, meanwhile the reaction time (RT) increased and 
      the accuracy decreased significantly, which proved the validity of three degrees 
      of mental workload induced. For the EEG parameters, a significant decrease of Î¸ 
      energy was found in Frontal, Parietal and Occipital with the increase of level of 
      mental workload, as well as a significant decrease of Î± energy in Frontal, 
      Central and Occipital, meanwhile a significant increase of Î² energy occurred in 
      Frontal and Occipital. There was a significant decrease of Î±/Î¸ in Occipital, and 
      significant increases of Î¸/Î² and (Î±+Î²)/Î¸ in Frontal, Central and Occipital, 
      meanwhile (Î±+Î¸)/Î² and WPE decreased significantly in Frontal and Occipital. Among 
      the ECG parameters, it was shown that Mean RR, RMSSD, HF_norm and SampEn 
      decreased significantly with the increase of task difficulty, while LF_norm and 
      LF/HF showed significant increases. These EEG indictors in Occipital and ECG 
      indictors were chosen and constituted a multidimensional original sample. 
      Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract the principal elements and 
      decreased the dimension of sample space in order to simplify the calculation, 
      based on which an effective classification model with accuracy of 80% was 
      achieved by support vector machine (SVM). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates 
      that the proposed algorithm can be applied to mental workload monitoring.

AB  - According to the limited resources paradigm, prior cognitive effort should result 
      in a temporary depletion of available cognitive resources (Kahneman, 1973). Some 
      recent evidence however has proved an opposite effect of increment in the 
      availability of cognitive resources as a function of prior cognitive effort. In 
      the current study the follow-up effect of cognitive effort on sustained attention 
      was examined. Eighty-nine participants took part in the experiment. The cognitive 
      load was manipulated between subjects using three versions of the DIVA Task 
      (intensive warming-up condition, moderate warming-up condition and the control 
      one). Following the experimental manipulation, the availability of cognitive 
      resources during vigilance task was checked. Some significant effects of 
      experimental manipulation were observed. First, in the context of overall task 
      performance, subjects from the intensive warming-up condition obtained lower 
      total errors rate than subjects from the control one. Some moderate effect of 
      cognitive warming-up on time-on-task performance was also observed, although it 
      was isolated to false alarms rate. Those results, tentatively suggesting the 
      occurrence of the cognitive warming-up effect in vigilance performance, are then 
      discussed. PSYCINFO CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES AND CODES: 2300 Human Experimental

TI  - The interplay between uncertainty monitoring and working memory: Can 
      metacognition become automatic?
PG  - 990-1006
LID - 10.3758/s13421-015-0527-1 [doi]
AB  - The uncertainty response has grounded the study of metacognition in nonhuman 
      animals. Recent research has explored the processes supporting uncertainty 
      monitoring in monkeys. It has revealed that uncertainty responding, in contrast 
      to perceptual responding, depends on significant working memory resources. The 
      aim of the present study was to expand this research by examining whether 
      uncertainty monitoring is also working memory demanding in humans. To explore 
      this issue, human participants were tested with or without a cognitive load on a 
      psychophysical discrimination task that included either an uncertainty response 
      (allowing the participant to decline difficult trials) or a middle-perceptual 
      response (labeling the same intermediate trial levels). The results demonstrated 
      that cognitive load reduced uncertainty responding, but increased middle 
      responding. However, this dissociation between uncertainty and middle responding 
      was only observed when participants either lacked training or had very little 
      training with the uncertainty response. If more training was provided, the effect 
      of load was small. These results suggest that uncertainty responding is resource 
      demanding, but with sufficient training, human participants can respond to 
      uncertainty either by using minimal working memory resources or by effectively 
      sharing resources. These results are discussed in relation to the literature on 
      animal and human metacognition.

TI  - Nursing workload assessment in an intensive care unit: A retrospective 
      observational study using the Nursing Activities Score.
PG  - 288-297
LID - 10.1111/nicc.12854 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nursing Activities Score (NAS) is a promising tool for calculating 
      the nursing workload in intensive care units (ICU). However, data on intensive 
      care nursing activities in Portugal are practically non-existent. AIM: To assess 
      the nursing workload in a Portuguese ICU using the NAS. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study developed throughout the analysis of the electronic 
      health record database from 56 adult patients admitted to a six-bed Portuguese 
      ICU between 1 June-31 August 2020. The nursing workload was assessed by the 
      Portuguese version of the NAS. The study was approved by the Hospital Council 
      Board and Ethics Committee. The study report followed the STROBE guidelines. 
      RESULTS: The average occupancy rate was 73.55% (Â±16.60%). The average nursing 
      workload per participant was 67.52 (Â±10.91) points. There was a correlation 
      between the occupancy rate and the nursing workload. In 35.78% of the days, the 
      nursing workload was higher than the available human resources, overloading nurse 
      staffing/team. CONCLUSIONS: The nursing workload reported follows the trend of 
      the international studies and the results reinforce the importance of adjusting 
      the nursing staffing to the complexity of nursing care in this ICU. This study 
      highlighted periods of nursing workload that could compromise patient safety. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This was one of the first studies carried out 
      with the NAS after its cross-cultural adaptation and validation for the 
      Portuguese population. The nursing workload at the patient level was higher in 
      the first 24âh of ICU stays. Because of the 'administrative and management 
      activities' related to the 'patient discharge procedures', the last 24âh of ICU 
      stays also presented high levels of nursing workload. The implementation of a 
      nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:1 may contribute to safer nurse staffing and to 
      improve patient safety in this Tertiary (level 3) ICU.

TI  - Cardiovascular Biomarkers' Inherent Timescales in Mental Workload Assessment 
      During Simulated Air Traffic Control Tasks.
PG  - 43-59
LID - 10.1007/s10484-020-09490-z [doi]
AB  - One central topic in ergonomics and human-factors research is the assessment of 
      mental workload. Heart rate and heart rate variability are common for registering 
      mental workload. However, a major problem of workload assessment is the 
      dissociation among different workload measures. One potential reason could be the 
      disregard of their inherent timescales and the interrelation between 
      participants' individual differences and timescales. The aim of our study was to 
      determine if different cardiovascular biomarkers exhibit different timescales. We 
      focused on air traffic controller and investigated biomarkers' ability to 
      distinguish between conditions with different load levels connected to prior work 
      experience and different time slots. During an interactive real-time simulation, 
      we varied the load situations with two independent variables: the traffic volume 
      and the occurrence of a priority-flight request. Dependent variables for 
      registering mental workload were the heart rate and heart rate variability from 
      two time slots. Our results show that all cardiovascular biomarkers were 
      sensitive to workload differences with different inherent timescales. The heart 
      rate responded sooner than the heart rate variability features from the frequency 
      domain and it was most indicative during the time slot immediately after the 
      priority-flight request. The heart rate variability parameters from the frequency 
      domain responded with latency and were most indicative during the subsequent time 
      slot. Furthermore, by consideration of biomarkers' inherent timescales, we were 
      able to assess a significant effect of work experience on heart rate and mid/high 
      frequency-band ratio of the heart rate variability. Results indicated that 
      different cardiovascular biomarkers reveal different inherent timescales.

TI  - Diagnostic capabilities of artificial intelligence as an additional reader in a 
      breast cancer screening program.
PG  - 6145-6157
LID - 10.1007/s00330-024-10661-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the early-detection capabilities of AI in a 
      screening program over its duration, with a specific focus on the detection of 
      interval cancers, the early detection of cancers with the assistance of AI from 
      prior visits, and its impact on workload for various reading scenarios. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The study included 22,621 mammograms of 8825 women within a 10-year 
      biennial two-reader screening program. The statistical analysis focused on 5136 
      mammograms from 4282 women due to data retrieval issues, among whom 105 were 
      diagnosed with breast cancer. The AI software assigned scores from 1 to 100. 
      Histopathology results determined the ground truth, and Youden's index was used 
      to establish a threshold. Tumor characteristics were analyzed with ANOVA and 
      chi-squared test, and different workflow scenarios were evaluated using 
      bootstrapping. RESULTS: The AI software achieved an AUC of 89.6% (86.1-93.2%, 95% 
      CI). The optimal threshold was 30.44, yielding 72.38% sensitivity and 92.86% 
      specificity. Initially, AI identified 57 screening-detected cancers (83.82%), 15 
      interval cancers (51.72%), and 4 missed cancers (50%). AI as a second reader 
      could have led to earlier diagnosis in 24 patients (average 29.92âÂ±â19.67 months 
      earlier). No significant differences were found in cancer-characteristics groups. 
      A hybrid triage workflow scenario showed a potential 69.5% reduction in workload 
      and a 30.5% increase in accuracy. CONCLUSION: This AI system exhibits high 
      sensitivity and specificity in screening mammograms, effectively identifying 
      interval and missed cancers and identifying 23% of cancers earlier in prior 
      mammograms. Adopting AI as a triage mechanism has the potential to reduce 
      workload by nearly 70%. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The study proposes a more 
      efficient method for screening programs, both in terms of workload and accuracy. 
      KEY POINTS: â¢ Incorporating AI as a triage tool in screening workflow improves 
      sensitivity (72.38%) and specificity (92.86%), enhancing detection rates for 
      interval and missed cancers. â¢ AI-assisted triaging is effective in 
      differentiating low and high-risk cases, reduces radiologist workload, and 
      potentially enables broader screening coverage. â¢ AI has the potential to 
      facilitate early diagnosis compared to human reading.

TI  - Cognitive effort detection for tele-robotic surgery via personalized pupil 
      response modeling.
PG  - 1113-1120
LID - 10.1007/s11548-024-03108-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Gaze tracking and pupillometry are established proxies for cognitive 
      load, giving insights into a user's mental effort. In tele-robotic surgery, 
      knowing a user's cognitive load can inspire novel human-machine interaction 
      designs, fostering contextual surgical assistance systems and personalized 
      training programs. While pupillometry-based methods for estimating cognitive 
      effort have been proposed, their application in surgery is limited by the pupil's 
      sensitivity to brightness changes, which can mask pupil's response to cognitive 
      load. Thus, methods considering pupil and brightness conditions are essential for 
      detecting cognitive effort in unconstrained scenarios. METHODS: To contend with 
      this challenge, we introduce a personalized pupil response model integrating 
      pupil and brightness-based features. Discrepancies between predicted and measured 
      pupil diameter indicate dilations due to non-brightness-related sources, i.e., 
      cognitive effort. Combined with gaze entropy, it can detect cognitive load using 
      a random forest classifier. To test our model, we perform a user study with the 
      da Vinci Research Kit, where 17 users perform pick-and-place tasks in addition to 
      auditory tasks known to generate cognitive effort responses. RESULTS: We compare 
      our method to two baselines (BCPD and CPD), demonstrating favorable performance 
      in varying brightness conditions. Our method achieves an average true positive 
      rate of 0.78, outperforming the baselines (0.57 and 0.64). CONCLUSION: We present 
      a personalized brightness-aware model for cognitive effort detection able to 
      operate under unconstrained brightness conditions, comparing favorably to 
      competing approaches, contributing to the advancement of cognitive effort 
      detection in tele-robotic surgery. Future work will consider alternative learning 
      strategies, handling the difficult positive-unlabeled scenario in user studies, 
      where only some positive and no negative events are reliably known.

TI  - Blink-Related Oscillations Provide Naturalistic Assessments of Brain Function and 
      Cognitive Workload within Complex Real-World Multitasking Environments.
LID - 10.3390/s24041082 [doi]
LID - 1082
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a significant need to monitor human cognitive performance in 
      complex environments, with one example being pilot performance. However, existing 
      assessments largely focus on subjective experiences (e.g., questionnaires) and 
      the evaluation of behavior (e.g., aircraft handling) as surrogates for cognition 
      or utilize brainwave measures which require artificial setups (e.g., simultaneous 
      auditory stimuli) that intrude on the primary tasks. Blink-related oscillations 
      (BROs) are a recently discovered neural phenomenon associated with spontaneous 
      blinking that can be captured without artificial setups and are also modulated by 
      cognitive loading and the external sensory environment-making them ideal for 
      brain function assessment within complex operational settings. METHODS: 
      Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from eight adult participants 
      (five F, M = 21.1 years) while they completed the Multi-Attribute Task Battery 
      under three different cognitive loading conditions. BRO responses in time and 
      frequency domains were derived from the EEG data, and comparisons of BRO 
      responses across cognitive loading conditions were undertaken. Simultaneously, 
      assessments of blink behavior were also undertaken. RESULTS: Blink behavior 
      assessments revealed decreasing blink rate with increasing cognitive load (p < 
      0.001). Prototypical BRO responses were successfully captured in all participants 
      (p < 0.001). BRO responses reflected differences in task-induced cognitive 
      loading in both time and frequency domains (p < 0.05). Additionally, reduced 
      pre-blink theta band desynchronization with increasing cognitive load was also 
      observed (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study confirms the ability of BRO responses 
      to capture cognitive loading effects as well as preparatory pre-blink cognitive 
      processes in anticipation of the upcoming blink during a complex multitasking 
      situation. These successful results suggest that blink-related neural processing 
      could be a potential avenue for cognitive state evaluation in operational 
      settings-both specialized environments such as cockpits, space exploration, 
      military units, etc. and everyday situations such as driving, athletics, 
      human-machine interactions, etc.-where human cognition needs to be seamlessly 
      monitored and optimized.

TI  - Exploring the SenseMaking Process through Interactions and fNIRS in Immersive 
      Visualization.
PG  - 2714-2724
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2021.3067693 [doi]
AB  - Theories of cognition inform our decisions when designing human-computer 
      interfaces, and immersive systems enable us to examine these theories. This work 
      explores the sensemaking process in an immersive environment through studying 
      both internal and external user behaviors with a classical visualization problem: 
      a visual comparison and clustering task. We developed an immersive system to 
      perform a user study, collecting user behavior data from different channels: AR 
      HMD for capturing external user interactions, functional near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) for capturing internal neural sequences, and video for 
      references. To examine sensemaking, we assessed how the layout of the interface 
      (planar 2D vs. cylindrical 3D layout) and the challenge level of the task (low 
      vs. high cognitive load) influenced the users' interactions, how these 
      interactions changed over time, and how they influenced task performance. We also 
      developed a visualization system to explore joint patterns among all the data 
      channels. We found that increased interactions and cerebral hemodynamic responses 
      were associated with more accurate performance, especially on cognitively 
      demanding trials. The layout types did not reliably influence interactions or 
      task performance. We discuss how these findings inform the design and evaluation 
      of immersive systems, predict user performance and interaction, and offer 
      theoretical insights about sensemaking from the perspective of embodied and 
      distributed cognition.

TI  - Effect of Stress on Sleep Quality among Medical Students: A Cross-sectional Study 
      at Jazan University, Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 586-593
LID - 10.4103/aam.aam_7_24 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has long been understood that sleep is a necessary therapeutic 
      element of human physiology and is crucial for healthy functioning, mental 
      health, and quality of life. Medical students frequently minimize their sleep and 
      habits to cope with their workload and their stressful lives, which has a 
      negative influence on both mental health and academic performance. The purpose of 
      this study was to evaluate the prevalence of stress and its effect on sleep 
      quality among medical students (in both the preclinical and clinical years) at 
      Jazan University in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      research design was applied in this study. The sample constituted medical 
      students at Jazan University, Jazan region, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered 
      online survey was distributed actively to measure the variables of interest. 
      RESULTS: This study examined the sleep quality and psychological distress among 
      347 students. The findings revealed that a significant proportion of students 
      experienced sleep difficulties, with 52.8% reporting mild sleep problems and 
      46.6% reporting moderate sleep difficulties. In addition, a notable percentage of 
      participants (28.2%) reported very high psychological distress, while 27.4% 
      experienced severe psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that 
      medical students had a high level of stress and poor sleep quality, which led to 
      unhealthy habits, such as consuming many energy drinks. Hence, it is recommended 
      that concerns should be addressed to minimize the risk of developing chronic 
      illnesses.

AB  - Mental workload is a key factor influencing the occurrence of human error, 
      especially during piloting and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations, where 
      safety depends on the ability of pilots to act appropriately. In particular, 
      excessively high or low mental workload can lead operators to neglect critical 
      information. The objective of the present study is to investigate the potential 
      of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) - a non-invasive method of 
      measuring prefrontal cortex activity - in combination with measurements of heart 
      rate variability (HRV), to predict mental workload during a simulated piloting 
      task, with particular regard to task engagement and disengagement. Twelve 
      volunteers performed a computer-based piloting task in which they were asked to 
      follow a dynamic target with their aircraft, a task designed to replicate key 
      cognitive demands associated with real life ROV operating tasks. In order to 
      cover a wide range of mental workload levels, task difficulty was manipulated in 
      terms of processing load and difficulty of control - two critical sources of 
      workload associated with piloting and remotely operating a vehicle. Results show 
      that both fNIRS and HRV are sensitive to different levels of mental workload; 
      notably, lower prefrontal activation as well as a lower LF/HF ratio at the 
      highest level of difficulty, suggest that these measures are suitable for mental 
      overload detection. Moreover, these latter measurements point toward the 
      existence of a quadratic model of mental workload.

AB  - Many human motor skills can be represented as a hierarchical series of movement 
      patterns. Awareness of underlying patterns can improve performance and decrease 
      cognitive load. Subjects (n = 30) tapped a finger sequence with changing 
      stimulus-to-response mapping and a common movement sequence. Thirteen subjects 
      (43 %) became aware that they were tapping a familiar movement sequence during 
      the experiment. Subjects who became aware of the underlying motor pattern tapped 
      with greater kinematic and temporal consistency from task onset, but consistency 
      was not sufficient for awareness. We found no effect of age, musical experience, 
      tapping evenness, or inter-key-interval on awareness of the pattern in the motor 
      response. We propose that temporal or kinematic consistency reinforces a pattern 
      representation, but cognitive engagement with the contents of the sequence is 
      necessary to bring the pattern to conscious awareness. These findings predict 
      benefit for movement strategies that limit temporal and kinematic variability 
      during motor learning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human behavior patterns involve mutual interactions among psychology, 
      physiology, and stress, which are all associated with gait at different grades. 
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS: The study aims to reveal the interrelationship among 
      personality, mental workload, and gait patterns by capturing gait variations 
      using inertial sensors. It also assesses individual personality traits and 
      simulates stress to construct a gait classification model. METHODS: Sixty 
      participants were instructed to perform regular, low, and high mental workload 
      walking on the corridor to simulate a natural setting walking. Meanwhile inertial 
      measurement units (IMUs) were placed on eight body parts. Mental workload was 
      induced using the auditory n-back task, and their Big Five personality traits 
      were evaluated. Gait data from IMUs were categorized into nine classifications of 
      average, low, and high Big Five Inventory scores with three levels of mental 
      workload walking. Subsequently, the segmentation gait data were used as input 
      features for classifications in deep learning models, employing a sliding window 
      long short-term memory network for nine classifications for different personality 
      dimensions. RESULTS: The results indicated average accuracies of nine 
      classifications were 83.6â¯% for Openness, 84.4â¯% for Conscientiousness, 82.0â¯% 
      for Extraversion, 85.2â¯% for Agreeableness, and 84.5â¯% for Neuroticism across all 
      IMU placements. Remarkably, gait data from the lower back IMU achieved the 
      highest model performance, with an average accuracy of 92.7â¯%, in classifying the 
      different levels of personality and mental workload walking. In contrast, the 
      left wrist and chest showed several misclassifications among regular, low, and 
      high mental workload walking across personality traits. SIGNIFICANCE: Successful 
      classification can help monitor an individual's mental state in real time and 
      analyze personality dimensions, providing feedback and suggestions. The present 
      study demonstrated that gait characteristics can contribute to more profound and 
      personalized health information.

AB  - Decision aids are commonly used in tactical decision-making environments to help 
      humans integrate base-rate and multi-cue information. However, it is important 
      that users appropriately trust and rely on aids. Decision aids can be presented 
      in many ways, but the literature lacks clarity over the conditions surrounding 
      their effectiveness. This research aims to determine whether a numerical or 
      graphical aid more effectively supports human performance, and explores the 
      relationships between aid presentation, trust, and workload. Participants 
      (N = 30) completed a signal-identification task that required integration of 
      readings from a set of three dynamic gauges. Participants experienced three 
      conditions: unaided, using a numerical aid, and using a graphical aid. The aids 
      combined gauge and base-rate information in a statistically-optimal fashion. 
      Participants also indicated how much they trusted the system and how hard they 
      worked during the task. Analyses explored the impact of aid condition on 
      sensitivity, response bias, response time, trust, and workload. Both the 
      numerical and graphical aids produced significant increases in sensitivity and 
      trust, and significant decreases in workload in comparison to the unaided 
      condition. The difference in response time between the graphical and unaided 
      conditions approached significance, with participants responding faster using the 
      graphical aid without decrements in sensitivity. Significant interactions between 
      aid and signal type indicated that both aided conditions promoted faster 
      responding to non-hostile signals, with larger mean differences in the graphical 
      aid condition. Practically, graphical aids in which suggestions are more salient 
      to users may promote faster responding in tactical environments, with negligible 
      cost of accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aircraft cockpit is a highly intensive human-computer interaction 
      system, and its design directly affects flight safety. OBJECTIVE: To optimize the 
      display interface design in complex flight tasks, the present study aimed to 
      propose a dynamic conceptual framework and a timeline task analysis method for 
      the quantization of the dynamic time effect of mental workload and the 
      influencing factors of task types in the mental workload prediction model. 
      METHODS: The multi-factor mental workload prediction model based on attention 
      resource allocation was integrated to establish the dynamic prediction model of 
      mental workload. The ergonomics simulation experiment was carried out by 
      recording the data on the performance of embedded subtasks, National Aeronautics 
      and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) subjective evaluation, and 
      eye tracking. RESULTS: The results indicated that the prediction model had a good 
      prediction accuracy and effectiveness under different simulated interfaces and 
      complex tasks, and the real-time monitoring of pilots' mental workload state was 
      realized. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the prediction model and the experimental 
      method could be applied to avoid the overload of the pilot throughout the flight 
      phase by optimizing the display interface and adjusting the flight task.

AB  - One of the key questions in the study of human language acquisition is the extent 
      to which the development of neural processing networks for different components 
      of language are modulated by exposure to linguistic stimuli. Sign languages offer 
      a unique perspective on this issue, because prelingually Deaf children who 
      receive access to complex linguistic input later in life provide a window into 
      brain maturation in the absence of language, and subsequent neuroplasticity of 
      neurolinguistic networks during late language learning. While the duration of 
      sensitive periods of acquisition of linguistic subsystems (sound, vocabulary, and 
      syntactic structure) is well established on the basis of L2 acquisition in spoken 
      language, for sign languages, the relative timelines for development of neural 
      processing networks for linguistic sub-domains are unknown. We examined neural 
      responses of a group of Deaf signers who received access to signed input at 
      varying ages to three linguistic phenomena at the levels of classifier signs, 
      syntactic structure, and information structure. The amplitude of the N400 
      response to the marked word order condition negatively correlated with the age of 
      acquisition for syntax and information structure, indicating increased cognitive 
      load in these conditions. Additionally, the combination of behavioral and neural 
      data suggested that late learners preferentially relied on classifiers over word 
      order for meaning extraction. This suggests that late acquisition of sign 
      language significantly increases cognitive load during analysis of syntax and 
      information structure, but not word-level meaning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The farmers cannot help working in outdoor conditions which have high 
      humidity and solar radiation during the harvest period. Wearable items including 
      clothing are the nearest environment of human body, and to understand the current 
      state of them can be a way to set up an active prevention strategy against the 
      health risk from heat stress in summertime agriculture. The aim of this study was 
      to investigate the work wear and accessories which the elderly farmers used 
      during agricultural working. METHODS: One hundred twenty farmers (49 males and 71 
      females) working in nine separate sites on different days took part in this 
      study. The average age of subjects was 61 years old. We examined the types of 
      working posture, clothing, and items that the farmers used and/or wore. We also 
      interviewed the farmers to know why they used such items while working. RESULTS: 
      The results of this study were as follows: (1) Farmers worked in the thermal 
      environment which was over wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) reference value, and 
      the farmers could suffer heat stress due to workload induced from wearing 
      conventional long-sleeved shirts and long trousers which were 0.66 clo in average 
      under this summertime working thermal condition. (2) The farmers tended to change 
      the layer of upper clothing for adapting to weather condition. (3) The types of 
      footwear used seemed to be related with facilities as well as weather, and 
      farmers tended to wear lighter footwear when the weather is hotter or when they 
      work in PVC greenhouse. The majority of elderly farmers wore loafers and rubber 
      shoes which had indistinguishable thin soles. (4) The types of hats showed the 
      difference between facilities as well as gender and only 31.7% of all 
      participants used long brims. (5) Korean elderly farmers did not use any active 
      cooling item as agricultural auxiliary tools in summer harvesting time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Korean elderly farmers worked in poor surroundings which could 
      threaten their health and safety and seemed not to adjust their workload and 
      clothing during summer harvest season. Thus, it would be necessary to monitor 
      individual responses in order to ensure that the risk of heat stress is 
      prevented.

TI  - Driver Vigilance in Automated Vehicles: Effects of Demands on Hazard Detection 
      Performance.
PG  - 474-487
LID - 10.1177/0018720818802095 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated driver vigilance in partially automated 
      vehicles to determine whether increased task demands reduce a driver's ability to 
      monitor for automation failures and whether the vigilance decrement associated 
      with hazard detections is due to driver overload. BACKGROUND: Drivers of 
      partially automated vehicles are expected to monitor for signs of automation 
      failure. Previous research has shown that a driver's ability to perform this duty 
      declines over time. One possible explanation for this vigilance decrement is that 
      the extreme demands of vigilance causes overload and leads to depletion of 
      limited attentional resources required for vigilance. METHOD: Participants 
      completed a 40-min drive in a simulated partially automated vehicle and were 
      tasked with monitoring for hazards that represented potential automation 
      failures. Two factors were manipulated to test the impact of monitoring demands 
      on performance: Spatial uncertainty and event rate. RESULTS: As predicted, hazard 
      detection performance was poorer when monitoring demands were increased, and 
      performance declined as a function of time on task. Subjective reports also 
      indicated high workload and task-induced stress. CONCLUSION: Drivers of partially 
      automated vehicles are impaired by the vigilance decrement and elevated task 
      demands, meaning that safe operation becomes less likely when the demands 
      associated with monitoring automation increase and as a drive extends in 
      duration. This study also supports the notion that vigilance performance in 
      partially automated vehicles is likely due to driver overload. APPLICATION: 
      Developers of automation technologies should consider countermeasures that 
      attenuate a driver's cognitive load when tasked with monitoring automation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) can effectively 
      discriminate the severe/critical state of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) at the prehospital stage remains unknown. We aimed to assess the 
      performance of NEWS2 in rapidly discriminating severe/critical COVID-19 and its 
      relationship with prehospital medical services. METHODS: Six illness severity 
      scores of 414 patients were calculated at the prehospital stage. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curves were generated to explore the ability of these 
      scores to discriminate severe/critical patients from mild/moderate patients. A 
      logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate independent predictors 
      associated with severe/critical state. RESULTS: The age, numbers of 
      comorbidities, prehospital care workload, consumption of medical human resources, 
      and illness severity scores of severe/critical patients were higher than those of 
      mild/moderate patients (pâ<â0.05). When NEWS2 scores >2, the sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 93.5%, 
      90.7%, 74.1%, and 98.0%, respectively. The C-statistic of NEWS2 (0.963) was 
      higher than that of quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (0.680, pâ<â0.001), 
      CRB-65 (0.879, pâ<â0.001), Rapid Acute Physiology Score (0.692, pâ<â0.001), and 
      Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (0.879, pâ<â0.001). NEWS2 was positively 
      correlated with the numbers of prehospital treatment measures (râ=â0.732, 
      pâ<â0.001), numbers of medical staff (râ=â0.615, pâ<â0.001), and total transport 
      time (râ=â0.595, pâ<â0.001). Age â¥65âyears (ORâ=â5.43, pâ=â0.016), hypertension 
      (ORâ=â5.39, pâ<â0.001), active malignancy (ORâ=â5.94, pâ=â0.005), and NEWS2 
      scores >2 (ORâ=â124.88, pâ<â0.001) were independent predictors to discriminate 
      severe/critical patients. Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) (OR =1.87, pâ<â0.001) was 
      the unique independent predictor to discriminate false positive patients from 
      true positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital NEWS2 can accurately and rapidly 
      discriminate severe/critical COVID-19 during the Omicron variant wave. High 
      levels of NEWS2 indicate an increase in prehospital care workload and consumption 
      of medical human resources.

TI  - Drone-Augmented Human Vision: Exocentric Control for Drones Exploring Hidden 
      Areas.
PG  - 1437-1446
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794058 [doi]
AB  - Drones allow exploring dangerous or impassable areas safely from a distant point 
      of view. However, flight control from an egocentric view in narrow or constrained 
      environments can be challenging. Arguably, an exocentric view would afford a 
      better overview and, thus, more intuitive flight control of the drone. 
      Unfortunately, such an exocentric view is unavailable when exploring indoor 
      environments. This paper investigates the potential of drone-augmented human 
      vision, i.e., of exploring the environment and controlling the drone indirectly 
      from an exocentric viewpoint. If used with a see-through display, this approach 
      can simulate X-ray vision to provide a natural view into an otherwise occluded 
      environment. The user's view is synthesized from a three-dimensional 
      reconstruction of the indoor environment using image-based rendering. This user 
      interface is designed to reduce the cognitive load of the drone's flight control. 
      The user can concentrate on the exploration of the inaccessible space, while 
      flight control is largely delegated to the drone's autopilot system. We assess 
      our system with a first experiment showing how drone-augmented human vision 
      supports spatial understanding and improves natural interaction with the drone.

PG  - 47-71
LID - 10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2016016541 [doi]
AB  - Pain is a complex sensory experience, and cognitive factors such as attention can 
      influence its perception. Modulation of pain involves a network of subcortical 
      structures; however, the role and relationship of these regions in cognitive 
      modulation of pain are not well understood. The aims of this research were to 
      evaluate the behavioral effect of cognitive modulation of pain and investigate 
      the neural correlates of this mechanism in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord 
      (SC), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural equation 
      modeling (SEM). We applied noxious thermal stimulation on the C6 dermatome to 12 
      healthy female participants while they performed the n-Back task. Our findings 
      demonstrate a significant attenuation in pain perception across the group as a 
      result of the task, along with high intersubject variability in the degree of 
      modulation. Using fMRI, our studies characterize neural responses in subcortical 
      regions that are involved in the modulation of pain. SEM analysis reveals 
      connectivity between the brainstem and SC at the group and individual levels, 
      depending on cognitive load and degree of pain modulation, respectively. All 
      together, our research demonstrates the behavioral effect of cognitive modulation 
      on pain and provides insight into the subcortical neural response to the process.

AB  - Common goals in the development of human-machine interface (HMI) technology are 
      to reduce cognitive workload and increase function. However, objective and 
      quantitative outcome measures assessing cognitive workload have not been 
      standardized for HMI research. The present study examines the efficacy of a 
      simple event-related potential (ERP) measure of cortical effort during 
      myoelectric control of a virtual limb for use as an outcome tool. Participants 
      trained and tested on two methods of control, direct control (DC) and pattern 
      recognition control (PRC), while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was 
      recorded. Eighteen healthy participants with intact limbs were tested using DC 
      and PRC under three conditions: passive viewing, easy, and hard. Novel auditory 
      probes were presented at random intervals during testing, and significant 
      task-difficulty effects were observed in the P200, P300, and a late positive 
      potential (LPP), supporting the efficacy of ERPs as a cognitive workload measure 
      in HMI tasks. LPP amplitude distinguished DC from PRC in the hard condition with 
      higher amplitude in PRC, consistent with lower cognitive workload in PRC relative 
      to DC for complex movements. Participants completed trials faster in the easy 
      condition using DC relative to PRC, but completed trials more slowly using DC 
      relative to PRC in the hard condition. The results provide promising support for 
      ERPs as an outcome measure for cognitive workload in HMI research such as 
      prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive devices, and can be used to 
      evaluate and guide new technologies for more intuitive HMI control.

TI  - Effects of Euglena gracilis Intake on Mood and Autonomic Activity under Mental 
      Workload, and Subjective Sleep Quality: A Randomized, Double-Blind, 
      Placebo-Controlled Trial.

AB  - While the human body maintains homeostasis by altering the balance in the 
      autonomic nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, a prolonged imbalance in these 
      systems can result in physical and mental symptoms, including a decline in sleep 
      quality and work efficiency. Euglena gracilis (Euglena) is a single-celled 
      microalga with the properties of both plants and animals and contains abundant 
      nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and fatty acids, which have 
      various beneficial health effects. This study evaluated the effects of Euglena 
      intake on the mood states and stress coping under mental workload tasks, and 
      subjective sleep quality. We assigned men and women aged 20 to 64 years to 
      Euglena and placebo intake groups, and measured indices related to the autonomic 
      nervous system, psychological states, and sleep quality together with the 
      application of workload stress before food intake, and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after 
      commencing intake. Euglena intake regulated the autonomic nervous system under a 
      workload and improved psychological parameters and sleep conditions. These 
      results indicate that the consumption of Euglena may regulate the balance of the 
      autonomic nervous system during stress and may have a favorable effect on 
      psychological status and sleep quality.

AB  - Current and foreseeable automated vehicles are not able to respond appropriately 
      in all circumstances and require human monitoring. An experimental examination of 
      steering automation failure shows that response latency, variability and 
      corrective manoeuvring systematically depend on failure severity and the 
      cognitive load of the driver. The results are formalised into a probabilistic 
      predictive model of response latencies that accounts for failure severity, 
      cognitive load and variability within and between drivers. The model predicts 
      high rates of unsafe outcomes in plausible automation failure scenarios. These 
      findings underline that understanding variability in failure responses is crucial 
      for understanding outcomes in automation failures.

AB  - Limb amputation can lead to significant functional challenges in daily 
      activities, prompting amputees to use prosthetic devices (PDs). However, the 
      cognitive demands of PDs and usability issues have resulted in user rejections. 
      This study aimed to create a Human Performance Model for Upper-Limb Prosthetic 
      Devices (HPM-UP). The model used formulations of learnability, error rate, memory 
      load, efficiency, and satisfaction to assess usability. The model was validated 
      in an experiment with 30 healthy participants using a bypass prosthetic device. 
      Findings indicated that the HPM-UP successfully predicted the usability of 
      prosthetic devices, aligning with human subject data. This research proposes a 
      quantitative approach to predict upper limb prosthetic device usability by 
      quantifying each dimension and computationally connecting them. The model, 
      available on Github and executable with Rstudio, could enable clinicians to 
      assess and analyze the human performance of various commercial prostheses, aiding 
      in recommending optimal devices for patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a great 
      challenge to health systems and their most accessible assets-community 
      pharmacies. Pharmacists faced many challenges such as incorporating safety 
      measures, changes in working schedule and workload, and meeting specific 
      patients' needs. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore and compare the 
      community pharmacists' roles, practices, implemented safety measures, and 
      psychological toll in Croatia and Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study employing an online survey was conducted in 2 countries 
      over a period of 6 weeks during 2020. The survey consisted of 65 items that 
      explored sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their workplaces, 
      including safety measures, pharmaceutical care, and their psychology while 
      working during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 574 pharmacists 
      participated in the study, of which, 90% were female, with a mean age of 38 years 
      (interquartile range 30.5-47). The study identified new pharmacists' roles that 
      evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic: manufacturing hand sanitizers in community 
      pharmacies, online patient counseling, and home delivery of medicines. Croatian 
      and Serbian pharmacists exhibited disparities in their incorporated safety 
      measures (higher for Croatia; P â¤ 0.001) and satisfaction with work organization 
      and counseling activities (higher for Serbia; P < 0.001). Serbian participants 
      were less satisfied with the public perception of their role during the pandemic, 
      and overall satisfaction was low, with a negative impact on mood and 
      productivity. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the implications for community 
      pharmacists during the pandemic in both countries. The extent of systematic and 
      logistical support provided to them during the pandemic could be an explanation 
      for the highlighted differences. It is imperative to develop a more effective 
      strategy to counter potential health crises to ensure a better response from 
      primary care pharmacists in the future.

AB  - The neural systems that afford our ability to evaluate rewards and punishments 
      are impacted by a variety of external factors. Here, we demonstrate that 
      increased cognitive load reduces the functional efficacy of a reward processing 
      system within the human medial-frontal cortex. In our paradigm, two groups of 
      participants used performance feedback to estimate the exact duration of one 
      second while electroencephalographic (EEG) data was recorded. Prior to performing 
      the time estimation task, both groups were instructed to keep their eyes still 
      and avoid blinking in line with well established EEG protocol. However, during 
      performance of the time-estimation task, one of the two groups was provided with 
      trial-to-trial-feedback about their performance on the time-estimation task and 
      their eye movements to induce a higher level of cognitive load relative to 
      participants in the other group who were solely provided with feedback about the 
      accuracy of their temporal estimates. In line with previous work, we found that 
      the higher level of cognitive load reduced the amplitude of the feedback-related 
      negativity, a component of the human event-related brain potential associated 
      with reward evaluation within the medial-frontal cortex. Importantly, our results 
      provide further support that increased cognitive load reduces the functional 
      efficacy of a neural system associated with reward processing.

TI  - Distractions in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory: impact for cardiologists 
      and patient safety.
LID - 10.1136/openhrt-2020-001260 [doi]
LID - e001260
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand human factors (HF) contributing to disturbances during 
      invasive cardiac procedures, including frequency and nature of distractions, and 
      assessment of operator workload. METHODS: Single centre prospective observational 
      evaluation of 194 cardiac procedures in three adult cardiac catheterisation 
      laboratories over 6 weeks. A proforma including frequency, nature, magnitude and 
      level of procedural risk at the time of each distraction/interruption was 
      completed for each case. The primary operator completed a National Aeronautical 
      and Space Administration (NASA) task load questionnaire rating mental/physical 
      effort, level of frustration, time-urgency, and overall effort and performance. 
      RESULTS: 264 distractions occurred in 106 (55%) out of 194 procedures observed; 
      80% were not relevant to the case being undertaken; 14% were urgent including 
      discussions of potential ST-elevation myocardial infarction requiring emergency 
      angioplasty. In procedures where distractions were observed, frequency per case 
      ranged from 1 to 16 (mean 2.5, SD Â±2.2); 43 were documented during high-risk 
      stages of the procedure. Operator rating of NASA task load parameters 
      demonstrated higher levels of mental and physical workload and effort during 
      cases in which distractions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this first description of 
      HF in adult cardiac catheter laboratories, we found that fewer than half of all 
      procedures were completed without interruption/distraction. The majority were 
      unnecessary and without relation to the case or list. We propose the introduction 
      of a 'sterile cockpit' environment within catheter laboratories, as adapted from 
      aviation and used in surgical operating theatres, to minimise non-emergent 
      interruptions and disturbances, to improve operator conditions and overall 
      patient safety.

TI  - Reflexive intergroup bias in third-party punishment.
PG  - 1448-1459
AB  - Humans show a rare tendency to punish norm-violators who have not harmed them 
      directly-a behavior known as third-party punishment. Research has found that 
      third-party punishment is subject to intergroup bias, whereby people punish 
      members of the out-group more severely than the in-group. Although the prevalence 
      of this behavior is well-documented, the psychological processes underlying it 
      remain largely unexplored. Some work suggests that it stems from people's 
      inherent predisposition to form alliances with in-group members and aggress 
      against out-group members. This implies that people will show reflexive 
      intergroup bias in third-party punishment, favoring in-group over out-group 
      members especially when their capacity for deliberation is impaired. Here we test 
      this hypothesis directly, examining whether intergroup bias in third-party 
      punishment emerges from reflexive, as opposed to deliberative, components of 
      moral cognition. In 3 experiments, utilizing a simulated economic game, we varied 
      participants' group relationship to a transgressor, measured or manipulated the 
      extent to which they relied on reflexive or deliberative judgment, and observed 
      people's punishment decisions. Across group-membership manipulations (American 
      football teams, nationalities, and baseball teams) and 2 assessments of reflexive 
      judgment (response time and cognitive load), reflexive judgment heightened 
      intergroup bias, suggesting that such bias in punishment is inherent to human 
      moral cognition. We discuss the implications of these studies for theories of 
      punishment, cooperation, social behavior, and legal practice. (PsycINFO Database

TI  - Investigating the relationship between physical, cognitive, and environmental 
      factors of ergonomics with the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders: A case 
      study in a car-parts manufacturing industry.
PG  - 215-229
LID - 10.3233/WOR-230155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) is a multi-factorial 
      disorder in most occupational setting and it has increased significantly in 
      recent years. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between 
      physical, cognitive, and environmental factors of ergonomics with the prevalence 
      of WRMSDs in a car-parts manufacturing industry. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      study was performed among 220 workers in a milling unit of a car parts 
      manufacturing company in 2021-2022. The prevalence of WRMSDs was assessed using 
      the Extended Version of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Noise exposure 
      was evaluated using dosimetry method. Mental and physical workload were evaluated 
      by the NASA-TLX and key index methods (KIM-MHO and KIM-LHC), respectively. Data 
      analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.0. RESULTS: The subjects' mean age 
      and work experience were 36.3Â±6.5 and 8.35Â±6.41 years, respectively. Eighty-five 
      percent of the subjects reported WRMSDs in at least one area of the body. The 
      results of mental workload assessment revealed a high workload mean range 
      (73.23Â±14.89) in all of the subjects. Mean score of KIM-LHC and KIM-MHO were 
      738.18Â±336.42 and 201.86Â±36.41, respectively with odds ratio of 1.32 for KIM-LHC 
      in creating the WRMSDs. There was a significant relationship between the noise 
      exposure, mental and physical workload and the prevalence of WRMSDs 
      (p-valueâ<â0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study revealed that 
      environmental, physical and cognitive factors can simultaneously be effective in 
      the prevalence of WRMSDs. Therefore, performing effective control measures 
      requires comprehensive attention to physical, environmental, and cognitive 
      ergonomics in the algorithm of ergonomics management in the workplace.

AB  - The human capability to learn new motor skills depends on the efficient 
      engagement of cognitive-motor resources, as reflected by mental workload, and 
      psychological mechanisms (e.g., self-efficacy). While numerous investigations 
      have examined the relationship between motor behavior and mental workload or 
      self-efficacy in a performance context, a fairly limited effort focused on the 
      combined examination of these notions during learning. Thus, this study aimed to 
      examine their concomitant dynamics during the learning of a novel reaching skill 
      practiced throughout multiple sessions. Individuals had to learn to control a 
      virtual robotic arm via a human-machine interface by using limited head motion 
      throughout eight practice sessions while motor performance, mental workload, and 
      self-efficacy were assessed. The results revealed that as individuals learned to 
      control the robotic arm, performance improved at the fastest rate, followed by a 
      more gradual reduction of mental workload and finally an increase in 
      self-efficacy. These results suggest that once the performance improved, less 
      cognitive-motor resources were recruited, leading to an attenuated mental 
      workload. Considering that attention is a primary cognitive resource driving 
      mental workload, it is suggested that during early learning, attentional 
      resources are primarily allocated to address task demands and not enough are 
      available to assess self-efficacy. However, as the performance becomes more 
      automatic, a lower level of mental workload is attained driven by decreased 
      recruitment of attentional resources. These available resources allow for a 
      reliable assessment of self-efficacy resulting in a subsequent observable change. 
      These results are also discussed in terms of the application to the training and 
      design of assistive technologies.

LID - 10.1177/0018720818759356 [doi]
AB  - Objective An experiment used workload capacity analysis to quantify automation 
      usage strategy across different task difficulty and display format types in a 
      speeded task. Background Workload capacity measures the efficiency of concurrent 
      information processing and can serve as a gauge of automation usage strategy in 
      speeded decision tasks. The present study used workload capacity analysis to 
      investigate automation usage strategy while information display format and task 
      difficulty were manipulated. Method Subjects performed a speeded judgment task 
      assisted by an automated aid that issued decision cues at varying onset times. 
      Response time distributions were converted to measures of workload capacity. 
      Results Two variants of a workload capacity measure, C(zOR) and C(zAND), gave 
      evidence that operators moderated their own decision times both in anticipation 
      of and following the arrival of the aid's diagnosis under difficult task 
      conditions regardless of display format. Conclusion Assistance from an automated 
      decision aid may cause operators to delay their own responses in a speeded 
      decision task, producing joint response time distributions that are slower than 
      optimal. Application Even when it renders its own judgments quickly and with high 
      accuracy, an automated decision aid may slow responses from a user. Automation 
      designers should consider the relative costs and benefits of response accuracy 
      and time when choosing whether and how to implement an automated decision aid.

AB  - This paper seeks to elicit and structure the factors that shape the execution 
      and, in particular, the coordination of work in Out of Hours care. Evenings and 
      weekends in UK hospitals are managed by specific Out of Hours (OoH) care 
      arrangements, and associated technology. Managing care within the constraints of 
      staff availability and demands is a key concern for both patient care and staff 
      wellbeing, yet has received little attention from healthcare human factors. A 
      study of sixteen clinical staff used Critical Decision Method to understand how 
      work is coordinated and the constraints and criteria that are applied by the 
      roles managing OoH care. The analysis identified ten types of coordination 
      decision that, in turn, underpinned three types of adaptive behaviour - 
      pre-emption, information augmentation and self-organisation - that were crucial 
      for the effective performance in OoH care. These behaviours explain how OoH staff 
      manage the task demands placed on them, individually and as a team.

AB  - A crucial aim in neuroscience is to understand how the human brain adapts to 
      varying cognitive demands. This study investigates network reconfiguration during 
      controlled semantic retrieval in differing contexts. We analyze brain responses 
      to two semantic tasks of varying difficulty - global association and feature 
      matching judgments - which are contrasted with non-semantic tasks on the cortical 
      surface and within a whole-brain state space. Demanding semantic association 
      tasks elicit activation in anterior prefrontal and temporal regions, while 
      challenging semantic feature matching and non-semantic tasks predominantly 
      activate posterior regions. Task difficulty also modulates activation along 
      different dimensions of functional organization, suggesting different mechanisms 
      of cognitive control. More demanding semantic association judgments engage 
      cognitive control and default mode networks together, while feature matching and 
      non-semantic tasks are skewed towards cognitive control networks. These findings 
      highlight the brain's dynamic ability to tailor its networks to support diverse 
      neurocognitive states, enriching our understanding of controlled cognition.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to reporting medical device-related pressure ulcers: A 
      qualitative exploration of international practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are a complex healthcare issue. Hospital-acquired 
      pressure ulcers are used as proxy measurements for the quality and safety of 
      nursing care. Medical device-related pressure ulcers are mostly facility 
      acquired, but their reporting has only recently been widely adopted. 
      Consequently, we do not yet know what factors impact their reporting by 
      registered nurses. OBJECTIVES: To identify and systematically report determinants 
      of the practice of medical device-related pressure ulcers reporting using the 
      Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases checklist. DESIGN: Descriptive, 
      explorative design using semi-structured interviews to explore barriers and 
      facilitators to reporting medical device-related pressure ulcers. SETTING: We 
      undertook online, telephone, and face-to-face interviews with participants from 
      11 different countries. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 17 participants who 
      represented acute care (Adult, Paediatrics), academia, and industry. Eleven 
      participants were healthcare professionals with more than 10â¯years' experience in 
      wound care. METHODS: The interview recordings were transcribed and coded by the 
      lead researcher. Data were analysed thematically using the codebook approach, and 
      themes were developed inductively and deductively. RESULTS: Participants 
      identified determinants of practice which clustered around four domains of the 
      Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases checklist i) individual health 
      professional factors, ii) professional interactions, iii) incentives and 
      resources, and iv) capacity for organisational change. Knowledge, attitudes, 
      workload, time, staffing, and perception of consequences, including financial, 
      were identified as the main barriers to reporting. Factors supporting the 
      practice were education, openness, and teamwork. Device procurement could take on 
      characteristics of a barrier or facilitator depending on the organisation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Reporting medical device-related pressure ulcers has been adopted in 
      healthcare institutions worldwide. Understanding what drives the reporting 
      practice enables improvements in incident reporting, which consequently can lead 
      to improvements in the quality of nursing care and patient safety.

TI  - Reducing the Costs of Automation Failure by Providing Voluntary Automation 
      Checking Tools.
PG  - 1817-1829
LID - 10.1177/00187208231190980 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the extent to which a voluntary-use range and bearing 
      line (RBL) tool improves return-to-manual performance when supervising 
      high-degree conflict detection automation in simulated air traffic control. 
      BACKGROUND: High-degree automation typically benefits routine performance and 
      reduces workload, but can degrade return-to-manual performance if automation 
      fails. We reasoned that providing a voluntary checking tool (RBL) would support 
      automation failure detection, but also that automation induced complacency could 
      extend to nonoptimal use of such tools. METHOD: Participants were assigned to one 
      of three conditions, where conflict detection was either performed: manually, 
      with RBLs available to use (Manual + RBL), automatically with RBLs (Auto + RBL), 
      or automatically without RBLs (Auto). Voluntary-use RBLs allowed participants to 
      reliably check aircraft conflict status. Automation failed once. RESULTS: RBLs 
      improved automation failure detection - with participants intervening faster and 
      making fewer false alarms when provided RBLs compared to not (Auto + RBL vs 
      Auto). However, a cost of high-degree automation remained, with participants 
      slower to intervene to the automation failure than to an identical manual 
      conflict event (Auto + RBL vs Manual + RBL). There was no difference in RBL 
      engagement time between Auto + RBL and Manual + RBL conditions, suggesting 
      participants noticed the conflict event at the same time. CONCLUSIONS: The cost 
      of automation may have arisen from participants' reconciling which information to 
      trust: the automation (which indicated no conflict and had been perfectly 
      reliable prior to failing) or the RBL (which indicated a conflict). APPLICATIONS: 
      Providing a mechanism for checking the validity of high-degree automation may 
      facilitate human supervision of automation.

TI  - NASA-Task Load Index Differentiates Surgical Approach: Opportunities for 
      Improvement in Colon and Rectal Surgery.
PG  - 906-912

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgeon workload, or human "cost" of performing a procedure, is not 
      well understood in light of emerging surgical technologies. This pilot study 
      quantified surgeon workload for colorectal procedures and identified patient, 
      surgeon, and procedural factors impacting workload. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: 
      Innovative technologies and procedures in surgery have generally been promoted 
      for the advancement of patient care. The resulting surgeon workload is poorly 
      studied with little knowledge of the contributing factors impacting workload. 
      METHODS: Surgeons completed NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaires to 
      self-assess workload following abdominopelvic colon and rectal procedures. 
      Corresponding patient data were retrieved from the medical record. Descriptive 
      statistics, correlations, and ANOVA were performed to compare surgeon and patient 
      factors, procedure type, and surgical approach on workload overall and by 
      subscales. RESULTS: Seven attending surgeons rated 238 surgeries, of which 218 
      (92%) had corresponding patient data. Surgeon experience and patient demographics 
      had inconsistent effects on workload. A statistically significant 3-way 
      interaction was identified among disease process, procedure type, and surgical 
      approach on workload (F(9, 146) = 2.17, P = 0.027), but was limited to open 
      procedures for neoplasia and inflammatory bowel disease patients. Proctectomy and 
      colectomy procedures compared across open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches 
      showed significant differences in overall workload and subscales, where the 
      robotic procedures required significantly less mental demand, physical demand, 
      and effort, than open or laparoscopic (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient 
      characteristics, disease process, and surgical experience had inconsistent 
      effects on surgeon workload. Major differences in workload were identified for 
      procedure type and surgical approach, where robotic procedures required less 
      mental demand, physical demand, and effort.

TI  - Look Hear! The Prefrontal Cortex is Stratified by Modality of Sensory Input 
      During Multisensory Cognitive Control.
PG  - 2831-2840
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhw131 [doi]
AB  - Parsing multisensory information from a complex external environment is a 
      fundamental skill for all organisms. However, different organizational schemes 
      currently exist for how multisensory information is processed in human 
      (supramodal; organized by cognitive demands) versus primate (organized by 
      modality/cognitive demands) lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging results from a large cohort of healthy controls (N = 64; 
      Experiment 1) revealed a rostral-caudal stratification of LPFC for auditory 
      versus visual attention during an audio-visual Stroop task. The stratification 
      existed in spite of behavioral and functional evidence of increased interference 
      from visual distractors. Increased functional connectivity was also observed 
      between rostral LPFC and auditory cortex across independent samples (Experiments 
      2 and 3) and multiple methodologies. In contrast, the caudal LPFC was 
      preferentially activated during visual attention but functioned in a supramodal 
      capacity for resolving multisensory conflict. The caudal LPFC also did not 
      exhibit increased connectivity with visual cortices. Collectively, these findings 
      closely mirror previous nonhuman primate studies suggesting that visual attention 
      relies on flexible use of a supramodal cognitive control network in caudal LPFC 
      whereas rostral LPFC is specialized for directing attention to auditory inputs 
      (i.e., human auditory fields).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores the influence of mobile phone secondary tasks on 
      driving from the perspective of visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor 
      (VACP) multiple resource theory, and it is anticipated to benefit the 
      human-centered design of mobile phone use while driving. METHODS: The present 
      study investigated 6 typical phone use scenarios while driving and analyzed the 
      effects of phone use distractions on driving performance. Thirty-six participants 
      were recruited to participate in this experiment. We abandoned traditional 
      secondary tasks such as conversations or dialing, in which cognitive resources 
      can become interference. Instead, we adopted an arrow secondary task and an 
      n-back delayed digit recall task. RESULTS: The results show that all mobile phone 
      use scenarios have a significant influence on driving performance, especially on 
      lateral vehicle control. The visual plus psychomotor resource occupation scenario 
      demonstrated the greatest deterioration of driving performance, and there was a 
      significant deterioration of driving speed and steering wheel angle once the 
      psychomotor resource was occupied. CONCLUSIONS: Phone use distraction leads to 
      visual, cognitive, and/or motor resource functional limitations and thus causes 
      lane violations and traffic accidents.

AB  - The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is crucial for motivation, reward- 
      and error-guided decision-making, yet its excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms 
      remain poorly explored in humans. In particular, the balance between excitation 
      and inhibition (E/I), demonstrated to play a role in animal studies, is difficult 
      to measure in behaving humans. Here, we used functional 
      magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy ((1)H-fMRS) to measure the brain's major 
      inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (Glutamate) neurotransmitters during 
      reinforcement learning with three different conditions: high cognitive load 
      (uncertainty); probabilistic discrimination learning; and a control 
      null-condition. Participants learned to prefer the gain option in the 
      discrimination phase and had no preference in the other conditions. We found 
      increased GABA levels during the uncertainty condition, potentially reflecting 
      recruitment of inhibitory systems during high cognitive load when trying to 
      learn. Further, higher GABA levels during the null (baseline) condition 
      correlated with improved discrimination learning. Finally, glutamate and GABA 
      levels were correlated during high cognitive load. These results suggest that 
      availability of dACC inhibitory resources enables successful learning. Our 
      approach helps elucidate the potential contribution of the balance between 
      excitation and inhibition to learning and motivation in behaving humans.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive load (CogL) is increasingly recognized as an important 
      resource underlying operative performance. Current innovations in surgery aim to 
      develop objective performance metrics via physiological monitoring from wearable 
      digital sensors. Surgeons have access to consumer technology that could measure 
      CogL but need guidance regarding device selection and implementation. To realize 
      the benefits of surgical performance improvement these methods must be feasible, 
      incorporating human factors usability and design principles. This paper aims to 
      evaluate the feasibility of using wearable sensors to assess CogL, identify the 
      benefits and challenges of implementing devices, and develop guidance for 
      surgeons planning to implement wearable devices in their research or practice. 
      METHODS: We examined the feasibility of wearable sensors from a series of 
      empirical studies that measured aspects of clinical performance relating to CogL. 
      Across four studies, 84 participants and five sensors were involved in the 
      following clinical settings: (i) real intraoperative surgery; (ii) simulated 
      laparoscopic surgery; and (iii) medical team performance outside the hospital. 
      RESULTS: Wearable devices worn on the wrist and chest were found to be 
      comfortable. After a learning curve, electrodermal activity data were easily and 
      reliably collected. Devices using photoplethysmography to determine heart rate 
      variability were significantly limited by movement artifact. There was variable 
      success with electroencephalography devices regarding connectivity, comfort, and 
      usability. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use wearable sensors across various 
      clinical settings, including surgery. There are some limitations, and their 
      implementation is context and device dependent. To scale sensor use in clinical 
      research, surgeons must embrace human factors principles to optimize wearability, 
      usability, reliability, and data security.

AB  - Under high cognitive demands, older adults tend to resort to simpler, habitual, 
      or model-free decision strategies. This age-related shift in decision behavior 
      has been attributed to deficits in the representation of the cognitive maps, or 
      state spaces, necessary for more complex model-based decision-making. Yet, the 
      neural mechanisms behind this shift remain unclear. In this study, we used a 
      modified 2-stage Markov task in combination with computational modeling and 
      single-trial EEG analyses to establish neural markers of age-related changes in 
      goal-directed decision-making under different demands on the representation of 
      state spaces. Our results reveal that the shift to simpler decision strategies in 
      older adults is due to (i) impairments in the representation of the transition 
      structure of the task and (ii) a diminished signaling of the reward value 
      associated with decision options. In line with the diminished state space 
      hypothesis of human aging, our findings suggest that deficits in goal-directed, 
      model-based behavior in older adults result from impairments in the 
      representation of state spaces of cognitive tasks.

TI  - Estimating Systemic Cognitive States from a Mixture of Physiological and Brain 
      Signals.
PG  - 485-526
LID - 10.1111/tops.12669 [doi]
AB  - As human-machine teams are being considered for a variety of mixed-initiative 
      tasks, detecting and being responsive to human cognitive states, in particular 
      systematic cognitive states, is among the most critical capabilities for 
      artificial systems to ensure smooth interactions with humans and high overall 
      team performance. Various human physiological parameters, such as heart rate, 
      respiration rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance, as well as brain activity 
      inferred from functional near-infrared spectroscopy or electroencephalogram, have 
      been linked to different systemic cognitive states, such as workload, 
      distraction, or mind-wandering among others. Whether these multimodal signals are 
      indeed sufficient to isolate such cognitive states across individuals performing 
      tasks or whether additional contextual information (e.g., about the task state or 
      the task environment) is required for making appropriate inferences remains an 
      important open problem. In this paper, we introduce an experimental and machine 
      learning framework for investigating these questions and focus specifically on 
      using physiological and neurophysiological measurements to learn classifiers 
      associated with systemic cognitive states like cognitive load, distraction, sense 
      of urgency, mind wandering, and interference. Specifically, we describe a 
      multitasking interactive experimental setting used to obtain a comprehensive 
      multimodal data set which provided the foundation for a first evaluation of 
      various standard state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with respect to 
      their effectiveness in inferring systemic cognitive states. While the 
      classification success of these standard methods based on just the physiological 
      and neurophysiological signals across subjects was modest, which is to be 
      expected given the complexity of the classification problem and the possibility 
      that higher accuracy rates might not in general be achievable, the results 
      nevertheless can serve as a baseline for evaluating future efforts to improve 
      classification, especially methods that take contextual aspects such as task and 
      environmental states into account.

TI  - Designing a medication timeline for patients and physicians.
PG  - 95-105
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy143 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most electronic health records display historical medication 
      information only in a data table or clinician notes. We designed a medication 
      timeline visualization intended to improve ease of use, speed, and accuracy in 
      the ambulatory care of chronic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 
      information needs for understanding a patient medication history, then applied 
      human factors and interaction design principles to support that process. After 
      research and analysis of existing medication lists and timelines to guide initial 
      requirements, we hosted design workshops with multidisciplinary stakeholders to 
      expand on our initial concepts. Subsequent core team meetings used an iterative 
      user-centered design approach to refine our prototype. Finally, a small pilot 
      evaluation of the design was conducted with practicing physicians. RESULTS: We 
      propose an open-source online prototype that incorporates user feedback from 
      initial design workshops, and broad multidisciplinary audience feedback. We 
      describe the applicable design principles associated with each of the prototype's 
      key features. A pilot evaluation of the design showed improved physician 
      performance in 5 common medication-related tasks, compared to tabular 
      presentation of the same information. DISCUSSION: There is industry interest in 
      developing medication timelines based on the example prototype concepts. An open, 
      standards-based technology platform could enable developers to create a 
      medication timeline that could be deployable across any compatible health IT 
      application. CONCLUSION: The design goal was to improve physician understanding 
      of a patient's complex medication history, using a medication timeline 
      visualization. Such a design could reduce temporal and cognitive load on 
      physicians for improved and safer care.

AB  - This study examines the effects of noise and the use of an Intelligent Virtual 
      Assistant (IVA) on the task performance and workload of office workers. Data were 
      collected from forty-eight adults across varied office task scenarios (i.e., 
      sending an email, setting up a timer/reminder, and searching for a phone 
      number/address) and noise types (i.e., silence, non-verbal noise, and verbal 
      noise). The baseline for this study is measured without the use of an IVA. 
      Significant differences in performance and workload were found on both objective 
      and subjective measures. In particular, verbal noise emerged as the primary 
      factor affecting performance using an IVA. Task performance was dependent on the 
      task scenario and noise type. Subjective ratings found that participants 
      preferred to use IVA for less complex tasks. Future work can focus more on the 
      effects of tasks, demographics, and learning curves. Furthermore, this work can 
      help guide IVA system designers by highlighting factors affecting performance.

TI  - Exercise increases sphingoid base-1-phosphate levels in human blood and skeletal 
      muscle in a time- and intensity-dependent manner.
PG  - 993-1003
LID - 10.1007/s00421-014-3080-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) regulates cardiovascular function and 
      plays an important role in muscle biology. We have previously reported that 
      cycling exercise increased plasma S1P. Here, we investigated the effect of 
      exercise duration and intensity on plasma and skeletal muscle S1P levels. 
      METHODS: In the first experiment, 13 male athletes performed a 60-min exercise at 
      65 % of VO2max and a graded exercise until exhaustion on a rowing ergometer. 
      Samples of the venous blood were taken, and plasma, erythrocytes and platelets 
      were isolated. In the second experiment, ten male moderately active subjects 
      performed three consecutive periods of one-leg knee extension exercise (at 25, 55 
      and 85 % of the maximal workload). Muscle biopsies and blood samples from the 
      radial artery and femoral veins were taken. RESULTS: Under basal conditions, S1P 
      was released from the leg, as its concentration was lower in the arterial than in 
      the venous plasma (p < 0.01). Exercise until exhaustion increased plasma S1P and 
      sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P) concentration (p < 0.05), whereas 
      moderate-intensity exercise elevated only SA1P (p < 0.001). Although knee 
      extension increased muscle S1P content (p < 0.05), it was not released but taken 
      up across the leg during exercise. However, sphingosine was released from both 
      working and resting leg at the highest workload (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma 
      S1P concentration is elevated only by high-intensity exercise which results, at 
      least in part, from increased availability of sphingosine released by skeletal 
      muscle. In addition, exercise markedly affects S1P dynamics across the leg. We 
      speculate that S1P may play an important role in adaptation of skeletal muscle to 
      exercise.

AB  - Language in its highest complexity is a unique human faculty with simultaneous 
      translation being among the most demanding language task involving both 
      linguistic and executive functions. In this context, bilingually grown up 
      individuals as well as simultaneous interpreters (SIs) represent appropriate 
      groups for studying expertise-related neural adaptations in the human brain. The 
      present study was performed to examine if a domain-specific neural network 
      activation pattern, constituted by brain regions involved in speech processing as 
      well as cognitive control mechanisms can be detected during a task-free resting 
      state condition. To investigate this, electroencephalographic (EEG) data were 
      recorded from 16 SIs and 16 age and gender-matched multilingual control subjects. 
      Graph-theoretical network analyses revealed interhemispheric hyperconnectivity 
      between the ventral part of the prefrontal cortex (pars opercularis and pars 
      triangularis) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in language experts 
      compared to multilingual controls in the alpha frequency range. This finding 
      suggests that the high cognitive demands placed on simultaneous interpreting lead 
      to an increased neural communication between prefrontal brain regions essentially 
      engaged in supporting executive control-a neural fingerprint that is even 
      detectable during rest.

TI  - Learning a Motor Skill from Video and Static Pictures in Physical Education 
      Students-Effects on Technical Performances, Motivation and Cognitive Load.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17239067 [doi]
LID - 9067
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of a video and 
      three different formats of static pictures (simultaneous-permanent pictures, 
      sequential-transient pictures and sequential-permanent pictures) on the 
      acquisition and retention of a complex judo skill in novice young adults. One 
      hundred and thirty-three first-year students in the certificate in Physical 
      Education (PE) were randomly assigned to either: a static-simultaneous-permanent 
      pictures condition (n = 30), a static-sequential-transient pictures condition (n 
      = 29), a static-sequential permanent pictures condition (n = 36) or a video 
      condition (n = 38). They were instructed to observe and reproduce a complex judo 
      technique (Ippon-Seoi-Nage) immediately after the learning phase (including a 
      sequence of three trials-the acquisition phase) and after one week without 
      observation (the retention phase). The results showed that the continuous video 
      generated better learning performances than all static pictures formats. 
      Moreover, it has been shown that sequential-permanent pictures presentation was 
      more effective than static simultaneous-permanent pictures and 
      sequential-transient pictures. In addition to the human movement effect, 
      complementary explanations in terms of cognitive load theory, perceptual 
      continuity, mental animation and intrinsic motivation are suggested. Implications 
      of the results for the effective design of instructional materials within PE 
      context are discussed.

TI  - "Postural first" principle when balance is challenged in elderly people.
PG  - 558-66
LID - 10.3109/00207454.2013.864288 [doi]
AB  - Human cognitive processing limits can lead to difficulties in performing two 
      tasks simultaneously. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of cognitive load 
      on both simple and complex postural tasks. Postural control was evaluated in 128 
      noninstitutionalized elderly people (mean age = 73.6 Â± 5.6 years) using a force 
      platform on a firm support in control condition (CC) and mental counting 
      condition (MCC) with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). Then, the same tests 
      were performed on a foam support. Sway path traveled and area covered by the 
      center of foot pressure were recorded, low values indicating efficient balance. 
      On firm support, sway path was higher in MCC than in CC both in EO and EC 
      conditions (p < 0.001). On foam support, sway path was higher in CC than in MCC 
      in EC condition (p < 0.001), area being higher in CC than in MCC both in EO (p < 
      0.05) and EC (p < 0.001) conditions. The results indicate that cognitive load 
      alters balance control in a simple postural task (i.e. on firm support), which is 
      highlighted by an increase of energetic expenditure (i.e. increase of the sway 
      path covered) to balance. Awareness may not be increased and the attentional 
      demand may be shared between balance and mental task. Conversely, cognitive load 
      does not perturb the realization of a new complex postural task. This result 
      showed that postural control is prioritized ("postural first" principle) when 
      seriously challenged.

TI  - AI-based Strategies to Reduce Workload in Breast Cancer Screening with 
      Mammography and Tomosynthesis: A Retrospective Evaluation.
PG  - 57-65
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2021203555 [doi]
AB  - Background The workflow of breast cancer screening programs could be improved 
      given the high workload and the high number of false-positive and false-negative 
      assessments. Purpose To evaluate if using an artificial intelligence (AI) system 
      could reduce workload without reducing cancer detection in breast cancer 
      screening with digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). 
      Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and 
      DBT images acquired from January 2015 to December 2016 were retrospectively 
      collected from the CÃ³rdoba Tomosynthesis Screening Trial. The original reading 
      settings were single or double reading of DM or DBT images. An AI system computed 
      a cancer risk score for DM and DBT examinations independently. Each original 
      setting was compared with a simulated autonomous AI triaging strategy (the least 
      suspicious examinations for AI are not human-read; the rest are read in the same 
      setting as the original, and examinations not recalled by radiologists but graded 
      as very suspicious by AI are recalled) in terms of workload, sensitivity, and 
      recall rate. The McNemar test with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical 
      analysis. Results A total of 15â987 DM and DBT examinations (which included 98 
      screening-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15â986 women (mean age Â± 
      standard deviation, 58 years Â± 6) were evaluated. In comparison with double 
      reading of DBT images (568 hours needed, 92 of 113 cancers detected, 706 recalls 
      in 15â987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 72.5% less workload (P < 
      .001, 156 hours needed), noninferior sensitivity (95 of 113 cancers detected, P = 
      .38), and 16.7% lower recall rate (P < .001, 588 recalls in 15â987 examinations). 
      Similar results were obtained for AI with DM. In comparison with the original 
      double reading of DM images (222 hours needed, 76 of 113 cancers detected, 807 
      recalls in 15â987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 29.7% less workload 
      (P < .001), 25.0% higher sensitivity (P < .001), and 27.1% lower recall rate (P < 
      .001). Conclusion Digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis screening 
      strategies based on artificial intelligence systems could reduce workload up to 
      70%. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

TI  - Inadequate human resources, equipment and training: A qualitative assessment of 
      the objectives of the NUHELP end-of-life care programme in the context of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 1252-1262
LID - 10.1177/02692163221103099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had a particularly severe impact on nursing 
      homes, exposing numerous pre-existing deficiencies in end-of-life care. AIM: To 
      describe how the COVID-19 pandemic affected nursing home and primary care 
      professionals' attempts to achieve the objectives of a pre-existing end-of-life 
      programme and to explore their personal experiences of end-of-life care in these 
      facilities. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study using thematic analysis. 
      SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted from March 
      to November 2020 with professionals from nursing homes and primary care 
      facilities who participated in the development of the NUHELP programme. RESULTS: 
      Six main themes were identified: (1) Comprehensive assessments of residents at 
      the homes were not conducted due to excessive workload and high staff turnover. 
      (2) New technologies and changes to professional roles were used to meet 
      relatives' needs for information. Residents only received information when they 
      requested it. (3) Advance care planning was not carried out and was limited to 
      potential hospital transfer. (4) Arrangements were made to allow relatives to 
      spend time with residents during their final moments, but complicated grief among 
      relatives and professionals is anticipated. (5) Management of complexity varied 
      depending on the degree of coordination with primary care facilities. (6) Nursing 
      home professionals felt abandoned, with a lack of human resources, equipment and 
      training. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic cast light on existing shortcomings in 
      nursing homes in terms of comprehensive assessments, communication, decision 
      making, grief management and palliative care complexity. Nursing homes need more 
      human, material and training resources, as well as improved coordination with the 
      public healthcare system.

      under a wide range of mechanical demands.

LID - 10.1152/jn.00765.2015 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the influence of cycle frequency and workload on muscle 
      coordination and the ensuing relationship with mechanical efficiency and power 
      output of human limb movement. Eleven trained cyclists completed an array of 
      cycle frequency (cadence)-power output conditions while excitation from 10 leg 
      muscles and power output were recorded. Mechanical efficiency was maximized at 
      increasing cadences for increasing power outputs and corresponded to muscle 
      coordination and muscle fiber type recruitment that minimized both the total 
      muscle excitation across all muscles and the ineffective pedal forces. Also, 
      maximum efficiency was characterized by muscle coordination at the top and bottom 
      of the pedal cycle and progressive excitation through the uniarticulate knee, 
      hip, and ankle muscles. Inefficiencies were characterized by excessive excitation 
      of biarticulate muscles and larger duty cycles. Power output and efficiency were 
      limited by the duration of muscle excitation beyond a critical cadence (120-140 
      rpm), with larger duty cycles and disproportionate increases in muscle excitation 
      suggesting deteriorating muscle coordination and limitations of the 
      activation-deactivation capabilities. Most muscles displayed systematic phase 
      shifts of the muscle excitation relative to the pedal cycle that were dependent 
      on cadence and, to a lesser extent, power output. Phase shifts were different for 
      each muscle, thereby altering their mechanical contribution to the pedaling 
      action. This study shows that muscle coordination is a key determinant of 
      mechanical efficiency and power output of limb movement across a wide range of 
      mechanical demands and that the excitation and coordination of the muscles is 
      limited at very high cycle frequencies.

AB  - AIMS: The role of laparoscopy in rectal cancer has been questioned. 3D 
      laparoscopic systems are suggested to aid optimal surgical performance but have 
      not been evaluated in advanced procedures. We hypothesised that stereoscopic 
      imaging could improve the performance of laparoscopic total mesorectal excision 
      (TME). METHODS: A multicentre developmental randomised controlled trial comparing 
      2D and 3D laparoscopic TME was performed (ISRCTN59485808). Trial surgeons were 
      colorectal consultants that had completed their TME proficiency curve and 
      underwent stereoscopic visual testing. Patients requiring elective laparoscopic 
      TME with curative intent were centrally randomised (1:1) to 2D or 3D using Karl 
      Storz IMAGE1 S D3-Linkâ¢ and 10-mm TIPCAMÂ®1S 3D passive polarising laparoscopic 
      systems. Outcomes were enacted adverse events as assessed by the observational 
      clinical human reliability analysis technique, intraoperative data, 30-day 
      patient outcomes, histopathological specimen assessment and surgeon cognitive 
      load. RESULTS: 88 patients were included. There were no differences in patient or 
      tumour demographics, surgeon stereopsis, case difficulty, cognitive load, 
      operative time, blood loss or conversion between the trial arms. 1377 
      intraoperative adverse events were identified (median 18 per case, IQR 14-21, 
      range 2-49) with no differences seen between the 2D and 3D arms (18 (95% CI 
      17-21) vs. 17 (95% CI 16-19), pâ=â0.437). 3D laparoscopy had non-significantly 
      higher mesorectal fascial plane resections (94 vs. 77%, pâ=â0.059; OR 0.23 (95% 
      CI 0.05-1.16)) but equal lymph node yield and circumferential margin distance and 
      involvement. 30-day morbidity, anastomotic leak, re-operation, length of stay and 
      readmission rates were equal between the 2D and 3D arms. CONCLUSION: Feasibility 
      of performing multicentre 3D laparoscopic multicentre trials of specialist 
      performed complex procedures is shown. 3D imaging did not alter the number of 
      intraoperative adverse events; however, a potential improvement in mesorectal 
      specimen quality was observed and should form the focus of future 3D laparoscopic 
      TME trials.

AB  - Previous evidence suggests that changes in spontaneous eye blink rate (EBR) in 
      human adults might reflect the amount of attentional demand (i.e. cognitive load) 
      during cognitive tasks. However, the actual direction of this relation is 
      uncertain, since most studies investigated the role of cognitive load on EBR by 
      employing visual tasks only. Here we aimed at elucidating the relationship 
      between EBR and cognitive load in non-visual tasks. Sixteen healthy participants 
      performed two auditory oddball tasks, i.e. passive listening to auditory tones 
      versus active counting of target tones; each oddball task was immediately 
      followed by a rest phase. Throughout the oddball tasks we assessed EBR and 
      recorded the P300 on ERPs as an electrophysiological measure of attention. The 
      results showed that participants' EBR increased during the active task compared 
      to the respective rest phase. Amplitude and latency of the P300 too differed 
      between passive and active tasks, but changes in EBR and P300 features were not 
      correlated with each other. Our findings demonstrated that an increase in 
      cognitive load is associated with an increase in EBR in cognitive tasks not 
      involving visual attention. These findings are consistent with previous evidence 
      suggesting shared neurobiological bases between attention and EBR.
