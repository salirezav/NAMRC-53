AB  - Industrial manufacturing is often organized in assembly lines where a product is assembled on a sequence of stations, each of which executes some of the assembly tasks. A line is balanced if the maximum total execution time of any station is minimal. Commonly, the task execution order is constrained by precedences, and task execution times are independent of the station performing the task. Here, we consider a recent variation, called the “(Calzedonia) Workload Allocation Problem” (WAP), where the precedences form a chain, and the execution time of a task depends on the worker executing it. This problem was recently proposed by Battarra et al. (2020) and it is a special case of the Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Balancing Problem Miralles et al. (2007) where precedence relations are arbitrary. In this paper we consider the computational complexity of the problem and prove its NP-hardness. To solve the problem, we provide different lower bounds and exact and heuristic procedures. The performance of the proposed methods is tested on previously proposed instances and on new, larger instances with the same characteristics. The results show that the proposed methods can solve instances with up to about 4000 tasks and 29 workers, doubling the size of the instances that previously could be solved to optimality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Worker' work-rotation between the workstations of an assembly line is a common task to an assembly line manager, to manage the workload between the assembly line workers. Usually, worker work rotation makes an interruption to a continuous production system. It is a desire of an assembly line manager to avoid the worker's work-rotation, at least between the work breaks. This work aims to protect the manager's interest by predicting the comfortable work-duration time of an assembly line worker for a given work, based on the working condition and the instantaneous physical & mental status of the worker. The comfortable work-duration time can be used during the worker's work assignment to reduce interruptions. Factors, which influence the longevity of workers' comfortable work duration time are identified. IIoT based sensors are proposed here to monitor the relevant factors for diagnostics. Machine Learning techniques are used as a part of prognostics to predict the comfortable work-duration time of a worker, based on his/her physical & mental status. Implementation methodology is explained along with a simulated experiment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of multi-robot systems is increasing in disaster response, industry, transport, and logistics. Humans will remain indispensable to control and manage these fleets of robots, particularly in safety-critical applications. However, a human operator's cognitive capacities can be challenged and exceeded as the sizes of autonomous fleets grow, and more sophisticated AI techniques can lead to opaque robot control programs. In a user study (n = 40), we explore how autonomous swarm intelligence algorithms and novel tangible interaction modalities relate to subjective and physiological indices of operator cognitive load (i.e., NASA Task Load Index, heart rate variability). Our findings suggest that there are differences in workload across conditions; however, subjective and cardiac measures appear to be sensitive to different aspects of cognitive state. The results hint at the potential of both tangible interfaces and automation to engage operators and reduce cognitive load, yet show the need for further validation of workload measures for use in studying and optimizing human-swarm interactions. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - With the introduction of more and more autonomous machines into the work environment, the role of a worker changes from the sole executor of a task to the observer and supervisor of a system that carries out tasks on her behalf. Often, the transparency and predictability of these systems decrease, making it difficult to comprehend underlying processes for the worker. Moreover, monitoring tasks can impose different levels of workload on the human operator leading to an increased risk of making serious errors. The present research aims at developing an adaptive assistance system for these types of tasks that is able to monitor a worker's current level of mental workload and provides support without reducing the worker's autonomy and sense of responsibility. We report results of an experiment using a monitoring task incorporating repeated event sequences to simulate underlying workings of a complex system. Results show that performance in connection with eye-Tracking measures are suitable indicators of the level of mental workload and that making the worker aware of underlying structures may reduce workload. Further steps towards an adaptive assistance system for monitoring tasks are discussed.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In this competitive era, there are no more manufacturing organizations that want to produce products in large volumes with low variations. The company is now shifting toward the idea of producing more variations that are of interest to consumers. Increased demand and production targets cannot be avoided. however, the increase must be adjusted to the worker's resources according to their function. If it is not balanced, it will cause a bottleneck on the production flow caused by the operating time at a workstation exceeding the takt time. then we need to balance the assembly line to get optimum and efficient results. Assembly line balancing (ALB) is used to flatten workload on all processes in a cell or value stream to eliminate bottlenecks and excess capacity, with a limitation of slowing down process time and excess capacity. The completion of this case study uses a combination of Priority Rule-Based/heuristic methods and Genetic Algorithm methods. © 2020 IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering.

AB  - Manual work is a cornerstone of manufacturing. This holds true today, as well as for future factories of the Industry 4.0 era. Use cases of manual work are small series or highly customized products. Assistance systems that support workers in dealing with such diverse assembly processes are developed and evaluated. This paper presents an evaluation of an Augmented Reality-based assistance system which is integrated in a manual workstation. This system is compared with video-based assistance regarding performance, user acceptance and mental workload. It shows a significantly reduced number of errors and scored better regarding time and mental workload. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The customization of final products in the automotive industry involves a large number of optional parts and leads to a huge variety of operation times at the various stations of the assembly line. The master production scheduling problem (MPS) for high-variant mixed-model assembly lines is to assign the individual customer-defined models of a basic product type to short-term production periods while anticipating the negative impacts of an unbalanced model sequence at the lower planning level. We propose a mathematical model formulation for the MPS and develop heuristic solution procedures that attempt to minimize the workload variability. Specifically, these procedures anticipate decisions on the mixed-model sequence and the resulting work overload at stations which has to be balanced by the assignment of utility workers. Furthermore, an integrated planning approach for solving the MPS and the production sequencing problem is proposed. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The transition to Industry 5.0 emphasizes the human-centric perspective and pushes for ergonomic risks prevention and mitigation. The diffusion of the production paradigms of mass customization and mass personalization also increases the need for methods and tools to support workers in manufacturing activities. The growing number of product variants requires a higher cognitive load and increases the likelihood of human errors. Work instructions become fundamental, as well as their digitalization. The technologies enabling industry 4.0 have opened up new scenarios for the use of this information, from extended reality to digital assistance systems. This work deals with the human-centered redesign of a workstation for the wire harness assembly with the aim of mitigating the ergonomic risks for operators, both physical and cognitive. Four different scenarios for using the work instructions were implemented and tested: paper-based instructions, workstation display, mixed reality application usable with a head-mounted display, and augmented reality application that only requires a projection system. The experimentation involved user experience evaluation, performance assessment, and objective postural analysis through inertial sensors. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Modern manufacturing systems typically require high degrees of flexibility, in terms of ability to customize the production lines to the constantly changing market requests. For this purpose, manufacturing systems are required to be able to cope with changes in the types of products, and in the size of the production batches. As a consequence, the human-machine interfaces (HMIs) are typically very complex, and include a wide range of possible operational modes and commands. This generally implies an unsustainable cognitive workload for the human operators, in addition to a non-negligible training effort. To overcome this issue, in this paper we present a methodology for the design of adaptive human-centred HMIs for industrial machines and robots. The proposed approach relies on three pillars: measurement of user's capabilities, adaptation of the information presented in the HMI, and training of the user. The results expected from the application of the proposed methodology are investigated in terms of increased customization and productivity of manufacturing processes, and wider acceptance of automation technologies. The proposed approach has been devised in the framework of the European project INCLUSIVE. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), pivotal in the Industry 4.0 revolution, has transformed manufacturing, particularly assembly lines, by enabling real-time process monitoring and data analysis to enhance productivity. Yet, its potential impact on worker well-being has been less explored. As the National Association of Manufacturers anticipates an opening of 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, the necessity for frameworks that not only understand but also improve employee well-being becomes apparent. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive visual emotion recognition framework that incorporates facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotional body posture recognition (EBPR) to assess workers’ psychological states. This initiative aims to mitigate human errors and accidents linked to stress or high cognitive load, thereby enhancing the manufacturing environment. Strategies such as optimized break time planning, line balancing, procedure modifications, and improved training are proposed to ensure both employee well-being and stakeholder benefits. This framework indirectly supports the industry's efforts to address the looming challenge of unfilled jobs by fostering a supportive work environment that enhances job satisfaction, potentially making positions more appealing and retaining valuable talent. By bridging the gap between technological advancements and human-centric considerations, our approach underscores the significance of integrating IIoT solutions with employee welfare initiatives to address both productivity and workforce sustainability challenges. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper proposes a new genetic algorithm approach for solving a multi-objective assembly line balancing problem. The objectives concern the minimization of the number of workstations and the workload variance, typically faced by most systems presented in literature, but also the minimization of three further aspects, not simultaneously treated in literature and very important in manual assembly lines: the number of skilled workers among workstations, the number of assembly equipment (e.g.: automatic screwdrivers, pressing machines, etc.) and the number of assembly direction changes along the sequence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding optimized assembly sequences, a classical case study taken from the literature is finally discussed. © 2017 CIRP

AB  - The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing systems has accelerated in recent years, with a shift towards understanding operators’ well-being and resilience within the context of creating a human-centric manufacturing environment. In addition to measuring physical workload, monitoring operators’ cognitive workload is becoming a key element in maintaining a healthy and high-performing working environment in future digitalized manufacturing systems. The current approaches to the measurement of cognitive workload may be inadequate when human operators are faced with a series of new digitalized technologies, where their impact on operators’ mental workload and performance needs to be better understood. Therefore, a new method for measuring and determining the cognitive workload is required. Here, we propose a new method for determining cognitive-workload indices in a human-centric environment. The approach provides a method to define and verify the relationships between the factors of task complexity, cognitive workload, operators’ level of expertise, and indirectly, the operator performance level in a highly digitalized manufacturing environment. Our strategy is tested in a series of experiments where operators perform assembly tasks on a Wankel Engine block. The physiological signals from heart-rate variability and pupillometry bio-markers of 17 operators were captured and analysed using eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant differences in both cardiac and pupillometry-based cognitive load indices across the four task complexity levels (rest, low, medium, and high). Notably, these developed indices also provide better indications of cognitive load responding to changes in complexity compared to other measures. Additionally, while experts appear to exhibit lower cognitive loads across all complexity levels, further analysis is required to confirm statistically significant differences. In conclusion, the results from both measurement sensors are found to be compatible and in support of the proposed new approach. Our strategy should be useful for designing and optimizing workplace environments based on the cognitive load experienced by operators. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - A human-robot hybrid cell is developed for performing assembly in flexible manufacturing in collaboration between a robot and its human co-worker. Robot trust in human is considered, a computational model for the trust is derived, and a method to measure and display the trust in real-time is developed. The collaborative assembly includes robot-to-human handovers of payloads (assembly tools). A novel trust-based compliant handover motion planning strategy for the robot is derived. The robot varies its handover configuration and motion based on robot trust in human through kinematic redundancy with the aim of reducing potential impulse forces on human body through payload during handover. A comprehensive scheme is developed to evaluate the collaborative assembly including the trust-based handover strategy. The evaluation results show that consideration of robot trust in human during the assembly and adjustment in handover configuration and motion based on robot's trust levels in human significantly improve human-robot interaction and assembly performance through increasing safety, human trust in robot, handover success rate, and the overall assembly efficiency by 20%, 37.58%, 30% and 6.73% respectively and reducing cognitive workload by 25.63%, with a minor reduction in the handover efficiency by 1.87%. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution, as the others, has introduced a new paradigm. This new paradigm refers to the set of digital innovations that are changing the manufacturing systems. The growing adoption of innovative devices in the production process has radically changed operator's work. 'New' operator is required to interact with the new technological devices. This means that the operator is employed in more cognitive than physical task. If on one hand the tasks are changing, on the other ones the existing models, already adopted in workload evaluation, are mainly focused on motor performances rather than cognitive ones. Therefore, in many cases they could not be applied. Further strong limitations are highlighted by scientific literature, on the existing methods adopted for the cognitive workload evaluation, in most of cases the evaluation is strictly related to a specific task, a large number of data samples is required, the data elaboration is quite complex and high computation times are required. Consistently with the issues above mentioned, the purpose of this paper consists in develop a numerical mathematical model allowing to evaluate the cognitive workload in smart manufacturing systems, in order to quantify the cognitive workload to assign to worker, avoiding a high rate brain occupancy, as well as a high psychological pressure lead to performance reduction in terms of reliability and safety. The model developed is applied to a full case-study, the results shown the effectiveness of the methodology introduced to predict the cognitive workload and provide a valuable tool for a preliminary evaluation of the human performance in production systems. © 2020, AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professor.

AB  - Despite the predicted growth of the amount of collaborative robots, little attention has been paid to the attitudes and needs of potential future users of these robots (e.g. factory workers). The main goal of our study was to identify recommendations to improve collaboration between robots and factory workers. We used the collaborative robot Baxter as a probe to elicit repsonses from factory workers in order to explore their perceptions regarding working with robots. We conducted four interviews with two factory workers simultaneously participating in each interview (n = 8). These interviews were analyzed and our findings suggest that workers believe robots can and have taken people's jobs. However, they also believe that robots can decrease their workload. © 2017 Authors.

AB  - Objective: This study investigates the effect of cognitive overload on assembly task performance and muscle activity. Background: Understanding an operator’s cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human–machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. Method: Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. Results: Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by the n-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times. Application: Results are applicable to the assessment of the effects of high cognitive workload in manufacturing. © Copyright 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we describe an experimental study that investigated the effects of electronic work instructions and AR based instructions (projected work instructions) on productivity, product quality and human operator workload. In a simulated assembly task, projected instructions on the work spot and operator guidance picking the correct component lead to significantly higher productivity and quality rates compared to instructions presented on a screen. Remarkably, at these higher levels of performance, the work load on the operator was not increased, but instead significantly decreased. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is presented for the solution of the bi-criteria assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem (ALWABP). This problem consists of determining the best assignment of the assembly tasks to workers as well as the workers to workstations in accordance with some desired objectives. Task times differ depending on worker skills. Two optimization criteria are considered to be minimized, the cycle time and the smoothness index of the workload of the line. The efficiency of the proposed MOEA is evaluated over a set of benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature. A suitable performance analysis is deployed concerning the quality of the Pareto solutions. The results demonstrate a very satisfactory performance in terms of solution quality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent advances in robotics and artificial intelligence have influenced the broader adoption of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare, but the same cannot be said about construction due to the dynamic nature of the work environment. To facilitate informed decision-making in HRC adoption, there is a need to evaluate the potential benefits of incorporating robots in construction activities. This study evaluates the impact of HRC on construction workers' workload. Experiments involving human-robot collaborative wood assembly tasks were conducted, and workload levels of humans in different scenarios were evaluated using physiological data collected with a wearable sensing device. Thereafter, a survey was administered to participants to assess their mental workload. Findings show that HRC posed less workload on workers compared to human-human collaboration, which demonstrates the potential benefits of HRC in the aspect of workload or fatigue reduction among construction workers, and thus could help enhance productivity. © ASCE 2023.All rights reserved.

AB  - Collaborative robots (cobots) have largely replaced conventional industrial robots in today's workplaces, particularly in manufacturing setups, due to their improved performance and intelligent design. In the framework of Industry 5.0, humans are working alongside cobots to accomplish the required level of automation. However, human-robot interaction has brought up concerns regarding human factors (HF) and ergonomics. A human worker may experience cognitive stress as a result of cobots' irresponsive nature in unpredictably occurring situations, which adversely affects productivity. Therefore, there is a necessity to measure stress to enhance a human worker's performance in a human-robot collaborative environment. In this study, factory workers' mental workload was assessed using physiological, behavioural, and subjective measures. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were collected to acquire brain signals and track hemodynamic activity, respectively. The effect of task complexity, cobot movement speed, and cobot payload capacity on the mental stress of a human worker were observed for a task designed in the context of a smart factory. Task complexity and cobot speed proved to be more impactful. As physiological measures are unbiased and more authentic means to estimate stress, eventually they may replace the other conventional measures if they prove to correlate with the results of traditional ones. Here, regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were utilised to determine the correlation between physiological data and subjective and behavioural measures. Regression performed better for most of the targets and the best correlation (rsq-adj = 0.654146) was achieved for predicting missed beeps, a behavioural measure, using a combination of multiple EEG and fNIRS predictors. The k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm was used to evaluate the accuracy of correlation between traditional measures and physiological variables, with the highest accuracy of 77.8% achieved for missed beeps as the target. Results show that physiological measures can be more insightful and have the tendency to replace other biased parameters.

AB  - In the automotive industry, a great challenge of production scheduling is to sequence cars on assembly lines. Among a wide variety of scheduling approaches, academics and manufacturers pay close attention to two specific models: Mixed-Model Sequencing (MMS) and Car Sequencing (CS). Whereas MMS explicitly considers the assembly line balance, CS operates with sequencing rules to find the best car sequence fulfilling the assembly plant requirements, like minimising work overload for assembly workers. Meanwhile, automakers including Renault Group are increasingly willing to consider other requirements, like end-to-end supply chain matters, in production planning and scheduling. In this context, this study compares MMS- and CS-feasible solution spaces to determine which workload-oriented sequencing model would be the most appropriate to later integrate new optimisation. We introduce two exact methods based on Dynamic Programming to assess the gap between both models. Numerical experiments are carried out on real-life manufacturing features from a Renault Group assembly plant. They show that MMS generates more feasible sequences than CS regardless of the sequencing rule calculation method. Only the sequencing rules used by real-life production schedulers result in a higher number of distinct feasible sequences for CS, highlighting that the plant might select a sequence with work overload situations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In comparison to the traditional usage of robots, Cobotization (Human-Robot collaboration) can be considered as an effective way to increase the productivity of assembly lines while ensuring job security and flexibility. However, successful implementation of human-robot collaboration scenarios requires adapted decision support tools. Workforce diversity can be mentioned as one of the factors that should be included to study its impact on both the performance of the production system and on ergonomics. Accordingly, in this research, a new bi-objective optimization model for the collaborative assembly line with Cobots is proposed to simultaneously minimize the cycle time and the physical workload of human operators. The workforce diversity of human operators is modeled through experience level and physical ability. To analyze the benefits of the developed model, a comparison between the different solutions from the Pareto front is conducted. The results show that the utilization of Cobots can reduce both cycle time and physical workload in the assembly line. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Production lines, designed in a serial manner, have attracted the attention of researchers for many years. Line efficiency, throughput time and workload balancing are the main concerns regarding assembly lines, due to the high volume production. Recently, specific assembly line configurations, such as two-sided and parallel lines, have been addressed by researchers within the operational levels of production. Parallel two-sided assembly lines, rather a new research area, allocate more flexible workers and reduce throughput time by incorporating the advantages of two-sided and parallel assembly lines. Since parallel two-sided assembly lines are utilized to produce large-scale products, such as automobiles, trucks, and buses in industry; they also require a significant worker movement between parallel lines because of the unavoidable walking distances between lines. In this respect, different from the existing literature, walking distances have been included in parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem with walking times and to propose the implementation of Bees Algorithm and Artificial Bee Colony algorithm due to the NP-hardness of the problem. An extensive computational study is also carried out and the comparative results are presented. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a case study aims to redesign a hand bag assembly line to reach maximum line efficiency with an optimum number of workstation for a constant cycle time. Three heuristic assembly line balancing algorithms known as "Kilbridge and Wester Column", "Rank Positional Weight" and "Largest Candidate Rule" are applied to design this single model assembly line. Yamazumi chart is used to the visual representation of workload on each workstation. Best two solution models are then simulated in Arena to check the feasibility. By comparing analytical and simulation report one best solution model is recommended to implement. The evaluation of the proposed solution model shows that the production line efficiency increased from 49 percent to 77 percent, number of manpower reduced from 23 workers to 16 workers and provides more balanced workload on each worker. Therefore, this paper can contribute to meet the same amount of customer demand with a minimized operator cost by higher utilization of worker. © IEOM Society International.

AB  - Exoskeletons, also known as wearable robots, are being studied as a potential solution to reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in construction. The exoskeletons can help enhance workers' postures and provide lift support, reducing the muscular demands on workers while executing construction tasks. Despite the potential of exoskeletons in reducing the risk of WMSDs, there is a lack of understanding about the potential effects of exoskeletons on workers' psychological states. This lack of knowledge raises concerns that exoskeletons may lead to psychological risks, such as cognitive overload, among workers. To bridge this gap, this study aims to assess the impact of back-support exoskeletons (BSE) on workers' cognitive load during material lifting tasks. To accomplish this, a physiologically based cognitive load assessment framework was developed. This framework used wearable biosensors to capture the physiological signals of workers and applied Autoencoder and Ensemble Learning techniques to train a machine learning classifier based on the signals to estimate cognitive load levels of workers while wearing the exoskeleton. Results showed that using BSE increased workers' cognitive load by 33% compared to not using it during material handling tasks. The findings can aid in the design and implementation of exoskeletons in the construction industry. © 2024 ASCE.

AB  - The delivery industry has seen dramatic growth in demand and scale in China. Due to the stock limitations and delivery time restrictions, the couriers may commit traffic violations while delivering, resulting in a pessimistic road safety situation. This study aims to reveal critical factors that influence delivery vehicle crash risks. A cross-sectional structured questionnaire survey is conducted to collect demographic attributes, workload, work emotions, risky driving behavior, and road crash involvement data among 824 couriers in three developed regions of China. The collected data is then analyzed through an established path model to identify the contributing factors of delivery road crash risks and risky behaviors. The road crash risk level (RCRL) indicator is defined by taking into consideration both frequency and severity. While the risky behaviors are defined by both their frequency and correlations to crash risks. The results indicate that 1) Beijing-Tianjin Urban Agglomeration has the highest road crash frequency and RCRL; 2) distracted driving and wrong-lane-use are among the top three risky behaviors for both Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration and Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration. For Beijing-Tianjin Urban Agglomeration, distracted driving, aggressive driving, and lack of protection are the top three risky behaviors; 3) time demand and personal efforts are important factors contributing to the cognitive workload of couriers; 4) objective workload can affect the cognitive workload and both workloads influence drivers’ emotions (anxiety and anger); 5) the objective, cognitive workload, drivers’ emotions influence the RCRL through their impacts on risky behavior but in different paths for three agglomerations. The findings highlight the importance of developing targeted countermeasures to reduce the delivery workers’ workload, improve their performance on roads, and mitigate severe crash risks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The frequently changing order stream and high product variety require robust planning and control approaches, as well as a flexible system structure in order to fulfill the highest possible customer service level and to keep the production costs on a reasonable level. In the paper, a combined production planning and capacity control method for assembly lines is proposed aiming at balancing the workload of the human operators and decreasing the overall production costs on a given time horizon. Instead of using the idealistic cycle times and simple manufacturing control rules, the proposed planning and control methodology is based on adaptive calculations taken from continuously updated historical production data. The manufacturing execution-level data is applied for building regression models predicting the capacity requirements of the future production scenarios. Besides, the historical data is also used as direct input of discrete-event simulations, to determine the proper control policies of human operator allocations for the different scenarios mentioned above. In order to calculate reliable and feasible production plans, the regression models and control policies are integrated in a mathematical programming model that minimizes a cost function representing the total production costs. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Manual assembly environments featuring the new Industry 5.0 concepts feature higher complexity, mass customization and less linear assembly lines, increasing expectations and demands on the human operator. Cognitive assistance systems can be implemented to provide information and support learning in real time. They help the user with information processing and with work execution. Providing a cognitive load assistance system can contribute to reducing the cognitive load exerted on manual assembly workers. This effort describes an evaluation of a Manual Assembly 5.0 Cognitive Load Assistance System, in the form of work instruction delivery methods. Participants were tasked with performing a manual assembly process using LEGO® bricks and taking and recording measurements, and then executing a 3D printing command for a predesigned SOLIDWORKS® model. The study simulated some of the major Industry 5.0 elements, including a single workstation with one worker, both pure manual and hybrid assembly production, a coding interface to automate the robot, controlled ergonomic settings, and mass customization. Eye tracking measurements, performance and NASA-TLX scores were used for evaluation of cognitive workload. Preliminary results show a difference in workload variables of fixation duration and NASA-TLX scores. © IISE and Expo 2023.All rights reserved.

AB  - Automatization, robotics and Industry 4.0 are deeply modifying the working condition with an expected reduction of the number of workers employed in traditional job and an increasing request of new professions. Despite these technologies could limit the involvement of workers, in some sectors humans are still widely employed, as in assembly line of manufacturing companies. As a consequence of this, the Human Factor (HF) will still have relevant influence in term efficiency, quality and safety performances. This paper approached the HF analysis into the manufacturing field in an assembly line. This study was focused on the analysis of those human-skills that are mainly solicited by the workload of the task that a worker has to perform during his own working activity. A set of practical test was designed and used to measure those skills during the real working activity. Results showed a wide range of performances reflecting different levels of skills between workers. This kind of information can support the human resources management because it allowed a worker classification based on their own skills. This classification can be directly applied to optimize the allocation of workers in assembly line with the using of Human Performance model and it can lead the way to a personalized risk assessment based on personal skills evaluation.

AB  - A worker assignment job rotation problem with the heterogeneous workers and the jobs with different workload level is presented in this paper. Both productivity and ergonomic criteria are considered in the problem and a multi-objective mixed-integer mathematical model is proposed to implement an ergonomic job rotation in a production system. The main objective of the model is to balance the daily workload that the workers are exposed together with reducing the production cycle time in the studied system. The proposed mathematical model is applied to a part of a truck assembly line. The model is programmed by GMPL mathematical modeling language and is solved by employing Gurobi solver. The computational results show the capability of the proposed model to optimize both objectives of the job rotation. © 2018

AB  - Despite the deployment of sophisticated automation and control mechanisms in modern industries, accidents continue to occur. According to the literature, human error is the predominant contributor to these accidents. This depicts the deteriorating cognitive functions of human operators in managing abnormal situations. To proactively prevent human error, this study proposes information theory-enabled eye metrics to quantify the cognitive workload of the operator. The proposed metrics are based on gaze entropy and are evaluated using experimental studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed metrics reliably measure the cognitive dynamics of the operator during various abnormal situations. A case study on Electric Overhead Travelling (EOT) crane operations is presented to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Teaching new assembly instructions at manual assembly workplaces has evolved from human supervision to digitized automatic assistance. Assistive systems provide dynamic support, adapt to the user needs, and alleviate perceived workload from expert workers supporting freshman workers. New assembly instructions can be implemented at a fast pace. These assistive systems decrease the cognitive workload of workers as they need to memorize new assembly instructions with each change of product lines. However, the design of assistive systems for the industry is a challenging task. Once deployed, people have to work with such systems for full workdays. From experiences made during our past project motionEAP, we report on design challenges for interactive worker assistance at manual assembly workplaces as well as challenges encountered when deploying interactive assistive systems for diverse user populations.

AB  - The philosophy of production without waste is the fundamental belief behind lean manufacturing that should be adopted by enterprises. One of the waste elimination methods is assembly line balancing for lean manufacturing, i.e. Yamazumi. The assembly line balancing is to assign tasks to the workstations by minimizing the number of workstations to the required values. There should be no workstation with the excessively high or low workload, and all workstations must ideally work with balanced workloads. Accordingly, in this study, the axiomatic design method is applied for assembly line balancing in order to achieve maximum output with the installed capacity. In order to achieve this aim, all improvement opportunities are defined and utilized as an output of the study. Computational results indicate that the proposed method is effective to reduce operators’ idle time by 12%, imbalance workload between workstations by 38%, and the total number of workers by 12%. As a result of these improvements, the production volume is increased by 23%. © 2020 American Mathematical Society

AB  - The flexibility and responsiveness of seru production have caught the attention of manufacturing and electronics industries. However, multi-skilled worker assignment poses a crucial and challenging decision-making problem for seru production systems. The existing literature on this problem for pure seru production systems primarily focuses on improving efficiency indexes, which often leads to an unbalanced workload among workers. To address this issue, this article investigates multi-skilled worker assignment for a hybrid assembly line-seru production system that comprises divisional serus and a short assembly line. To balance workload and optimize production efficiency, a bi-objective integer nonlinear programming model is developed. This model jointly optimizes worker-to-seru, worker-to-line, batch-to-seru, task-to-worker, and the processing sequence of each batch. A meta-heuristic method, combining Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA), NSGA-II-MOSA, is designed to solve the model. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model and solving method can greatly reduce workload imbalance while maintaining production efficiency. Moreover, NSGA-II-MOSA provides better Pareto solutions than three well-known multi-objective optimization approaches.  © 2024 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assembly line balancing problems aim to assign production tasks to workstations or people while satisfying some constraints and optimizing various criteria such as production rate or number of workstations needed. One specific instance is Simple Assembly Line Workload Smoothing Problem (SALBP-WS) that focuses on smoothing workloads of all workstations. This is important for establishing equity among workers or maintaining sustainable conditions for workstations. In this work, we develop several Answer Set Programming encodings for solving SALBP-WS. The performed experiments showcase better scalability results compared to problem specific exact methods based on branch and bound technique. Additionally, we propose a new criterion that handles the workstation idle times hierarchically, as a measure of smoothness of an assignment. © 2020 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Order picking is a difficult and cognitively demanding task. Traditionally textual instructions are helping new workers to learn different picking routines. However, the textual instructions are sometimes not written in the workers' native languages. In the area of Industry 4.0, where digital functions are finding their way into manufacturing processes, language-independent instructions are possible. Through a user study with 15 participants, we compare textual feedback in the workers' native language, textual feedback that is written in an unknown foreign language, and visual Augmented Reality (AR) feedback. We found that AR feedback is significantly faster and leads to a lower perceived cognitive load. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The ongoing trend toward Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary workplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production chain. Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing the operator's physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator's performance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for online assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate the workers’ attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers’ mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics in manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Incorporating ergonomic considerations into an assembly-line balancing problem (ALBP) enhances productivity and minimizes ergonomic concerns. The assembly process, characterized by repetitive motions and handling numerous components, can lead to worker overload. Consequently, the inclusion of ergonomic aspects results in an appropriate distribution of assembly operations and relative workloads. This study investigates a multi-objective ALBP aimed at minimizing the number of workstations, overall skill level required, and variance in workers' energy expenditure across workstations. To address the ALBP while considering the ergonomic aspects, this study proposes an approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) using Pareto optimality. A comparative analysis of the NSGA-II and MOSA is conducted in single- and multiproduct production scenarios, and a computational study involving various factors is performed to identify the dominant algorithm. The computational analysis indicates that the runtime performance of MOSA is 73.287% better than that of NSGA-II; therefore, MOSA outperforms NSGA-II. This study aims at applying scientific knowledge concerning manufacturing ergonomics to assist manufacturing industries in enhancing their productivity. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The increasing complexity and demands of assembly operations in manufacturing has been shown to lead to increased cognitive load in assembly workers. Previous work has outlined the complexity of an assembly worker's situation both in terms of difficulty and speed of work and there have been a few attempts at creating frameworks and methods for understanding the key aspects of what creates increased cognitive load. This paper presents the development of an analytic method, denoted CLAM (Cognitive Load Assessment for Manufacturing), and a tool for assessing cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly. It outlines the journey of the development as well as discusses and problematizes relevant meta-methodological issues paired with method development. The intended contribution of the work is to make a difference in reducing the cognitive load of assembly workers on the shop floor, thus focusing the development on applicability and usability of the tool in practice. With this purpose in mind, focus of the method development has been on the practitioners, i.e. the method should not require any expert knowledge to be applied. The CLAM method and accompanying documentation such as a handbook containing instructions towards using the method and interpreting the results, is available in an online tool. © 2019

AB  - With the rapid development of smart manufacturing technologies, machines as primary productivity have come into intelligent era. In current industrialization, workers play an significant role in PCB manufacturing and gradually become the bottleneck of the whole manufacturing process. However, the workers in factories have been ignored for a long time. There are not any intelligent method to organize, coordinate and manage them efficiently. In this paper, based on CPSS and ACP theory, we propose a digital worker system to facilitate biological workers to perform human resource management, largely reducing workload, improving working performance, and taking care of physical and mental health of human workers. In this CPSS system, we leverage ACP method to construct a super brain between digital workers, implementing descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence, thus providing personal guidance and management strategies for each biological worker. Consequently we could relieve job burnout and reduce turnover rate for PCB manufacturers.  © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This study sets out to extend the use of blink rate and pupil size to the assessment of cognitive load of completing common automotive manufacturing tasks. Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks. © 2022

AB  - Manufacturing systems are socio-technical systems, with explicit interactions between humans and technologies in shared workspaces. These shared workspaces could also be called hybrid collaborative manufacturing systems, which involve workers as well as technological equipment and combine the benefits of human workers and new Industry 4.0 technologies, such systems are particularly useful in a context requiring flexibility and adaptability. Furthermore, the new Industry 5.0 approach has the objective to shift toward more human-centric and resilient manufacturing systems. The key problems to solve in the design of collaborative manufacturing systems are the combinatorial assembly line balancing problem and the equipment selection problem. An efficient and sustainable line requires a cost-effective choice of equipment while improving the ergonomics and the safety of workers. Both decisions of balancing workload and the assignment of equipment impact the ergonomics of a collaborative system and present conflicting criteria. To this end, we propose a multi-objective approach, the objectives are the optimisation of the investment costs and the ergonomics with a fatigue and recovery criterion. We propose to linearise the fatigue and recovery to formulate a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation. We developed an exact multi-objective solving algorithm based on the ϵ-constraint to obtain the trade-off between these objectives. We conducted numerical experiments with different instances from the literature with promising results for instances with up to 45 operations. Finally, we discuss insightful managerial conclusions and future research perspectives. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increasing demands on the flexibility of assembly workers has led to numerous times of high exposure rates within one workday. Inflexible processing times in synchronized assembly lines mismatch the individual, circadian variable work capacities of operators. As a result, frequent performance peaks due to limited possibilities for individualization elevate physiological and psychological workloads. This paper’s main objective is an individualization of assembly system performance requirements aimed at providing the opportunity to adapt current processing times to individual work capacities for reactively levelling the operators’ workload. On the one hand, the authors focus on defining requirements to enable a company to record valid current processing times within a synchronized assembly line. The authors provide a checklist aimed at generating sets of raw data specifying the necessary requirements. This checklist can be applied by the user of the approach. The authors provide an approach of statistical data processing to eliminate non-valid data-sets which do not allow inference on human performance fluctuations. On the other hand, the paper provides an approach for planning synchronized assembly lines taking into consideration human performance fluctuations. Based on defining performance and time characteristics, the authors methodically deduce one exemplary recommendation for the examined synchronized assembly lines quantifying the expected value for production periods. As a result, this combination leads to the possibility of methodically adapting systems’ performance requirements to fluctuating operators’ work capacity. Moreover, application of the presented approaches within a field study leads to an analysis and evaluation of significant production periods in a German car manufacturer’s engine assembly. © 2014, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).

AB  - The benefits of automation in human-operated assembly lines are well known. Despite the rapid progress made in the field, complete automation is not always possible. Often robots cannot replace workers' flexibility, and sometimes there is no economically viable option for automation. A combined production system with both manual and automated parts could be the best configuration in such circumstances. Even with partial automation the number of workers in the line could be decreased, and workers' safety and health conditions could be dramatically improved. In this paper, MILP models are suggested to compare the total workload of workers when different numbers of robots are applied in an assembly line with partial automation and the minimum possible number of workers. The proposed MILP model is implemented in the AIMMS modelling environment and solved using CPLEX. The presented models can help evaluate the impact of adding robots to the line on total workers' workload and may assist decision makers in finding the best possible line configuration. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - A new Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread globally since 2019. Consequently, businesses from different sectors were forced to work remotely. At the same time, research in this area has seen a rise in studying and emerging technologies that allow and promote such a remote working style; not every sector is equipped for such a transition. The manufacturing sector especially, has faced challenges in this respect. This paper investigates the mental workload (MWL) of two groups of participants through a human-machine interaction task. Participants were required to bring a robotised cell to full production by tuning system and dispensing process parameters. Following the experiment, a self-assessment of the participants’ perceived MWL using the raw NASA Task Load Index (RTLX) was collected. The results reveal that remote participants tend to have a lower perceived workload compared to the local participants, but mental demand was deemed higher while performance was rated lower. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The automotive industry contributes high income to most of the countries. The assembly line is an essential part of the automotive industry because it combines all the components into a complete body unit. Assembly lines often experience delays in meeting production targets, requiring overtime to complete. Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) complaints among assembly workers predominantly lie in trimming, chassis, and finishing processes. Improvements are needed to reduce complaints according to the priority process. This study aims to prioritize the process on the assembly line with the parameters of work position, workload, work layout and equipment. This study implements the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to achieve the objectives of the decision-making process. Preliminary weighting priorities for chassis, finishing and trimming are 0.6153, 0.2313 and 0.1533; respectively highest weight is in the chassis process and will be a priority for this study in optimizing solutions. © 2022 CIRP

AB  - Purpose: Rabbit chase (RC) is used as one of the most effective techniques in manufacturing systems, as such systems have high level of adaptability and increased productivity in addition to providing uniform workload balancing and skill improving environment. In assembly systems, RC inspires the development of walking worker assembly line (WWAL). On the other hand, U-type assembly lines (UALs) may provide higher worker utilization, lower space requirement and more convenient internal logistics when compared to straight assembly lines. In this context, this study aims to improve assembly line performance by generating RC cycles on WWAL with respect to task assignment characteristics of UAL within reasonable walking distance and space requirement. Therefore, a novel line configuration, namely, segmented rabbit chase-oriented U-type assembly line (SRCUAL), emerges. Design/methodology/approach: The mathematical programming approach treats SRCUAL balancing problem in a hierarchical manner to decrease computational burden. Firstly, segments are generated via the first linear programming model in the solution approach for balancing SRCUALs to minimize total number of workers. Then, stations are determined within each segment for forward and backward sections separately using two different pre-emptive goal programming models. Moreover, three heuristics are developed to provide solution quality with computational efficiency. Findings: The proposed mathematical programming approach is applied to the light-emitting diode (LED) luminaire assembly section of a manufacturing company. The adaptation of SRCUAL decreased the number of workers by 15.4% and the space requirement by 17.7% for LED luminaire assembly system when compared to UAL. Moreover, satisfactory results for the proposed heuristics were obtained in terms of deviation from lower bound, especially for SRCUAL heuristics I and II. Moreover, the results indicate that the integration of RC not only decreased the number of workers in 40.28% (29 instances) of test problems in U-lines, but also yielded less number of buffer points (48.48%) with lower workload deviation (75%) among workers in terms of coefficient of variation. Practical implications: This study provides convenience for capacity management (assessing capacity and adjusting capacity by changing the number of workers) for industrial SRCUAL applications. Meanwhile, SRCUAL applications give the opportunity to increase the capacity for a product or transfer the saved capacity to the assembly of other products. As it is possible to provide one-piece flow with equal workloads via walking workers, SRCUAL has the potential for quick realization of defects and better lead time performance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, forward–backward task assignments in U-type lines have not been adapted to WWALs. Moreover, as workers travel overall the line in WWALs, walking time increases drastically. Addressing this research gap and limitation, the main innovative aspect of this study can be considered as the proposal of a new line design (i.e. SRCUAL) which is sourced from the hybridization of UALs and WWAL as well as the segmentation of the line with RC cycles. The superiority of SRCUAL over WWAL and UAL was also discussed. Moreover, operating systematic for SRCUAL was devised. As for methodical aspect, this study is the first attempt to solve the balancing problem for SRCUAL design. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Competitiveness in the aircraft manufacturing industry requires continuous improvement and modernization of its manufacturing processes, in order to keep the companies competitive in the market. In this context, the use of advanced manufacturing technologies and systems has been incessantly pursued to achieve productivity gains, sustainability and reduction of production costs, as well as being important in the individuals’ quality of life. Autonomous robotic systems such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) have been used on shop floor to assist the aggregation of these competitive advantages to the business. Coupled to the use of these vehicles, other technologies such as the internet, digital factory and cloud-computing have been integrated into manufacturing in direction of the so-called advanced manufacturing, or Industry 4.0. Thus, this work aims to apply the concepts of digital factory in an example of aircraft manufacturing system, to analyze the efficiency and workload of the AGVs that transport materials from the warehouse to the assembly stations. Based on a theoretical approach by discrete-event simulation method and guided by the principles of Industry 4.0, analysis related to needed amount of AGVs, cycle times, deliveries and downtime of the vehicles were performed for different situations. Thus, it searches for better results in terms of productivity and decision-making support regarding adding-value related to materials transporting and information over long distances, delays, waiting and unnecessary movement of workers, in order to obtain improvement and profits for the aircraft manufacturing system. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Nowadays, end customers require personalized products to match their specific needs. Thus, production systems must be extremely flexible. Companies typically exploit assembly lines to manufacture produces in great volumes. The development of assembly lines distinguished by mixed or multi models increases their flexibility concerning the number of product variants able to be manufactured. However, few scientific contributions deal with customizable products, i.e., produces which can be designed and ordered requiring or not a large set of available accessories. This manuscript proposes an original two-step procedure to deal with the multi-manned assembly lines for customized product manufacturing. The first step of the procedure groups the accessories together in clusters according to a specific similarity index. The accessories belonging to a cluster are typically requested together by customers and necessitate a significant mounting time. Thus, this procedure aims to split accessories belonging to the same cluster to different assembly operators avoiding their overloads. The second procedure step consists of an innovative optimization model which defines tasks and accessory assignment to operators. Furthermore, the developed model defines the activity time schedule in compliance with the task precedencies maximizing the operator workload balance. An industrial case study is adopted to test and validate the proposed procedure. The obtained results suggest superior balancing of such assembly lines, with an average worker utilization rate greater than 90%. Furthermore, in the worst case scenario in terms of customer accessories requirement, just 4 line operators out of 16 are distinguished by a maximum workload greater than the cycle time. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Process industries rely on effective decision-making by human operators to ensure safety. Control room operators acquire various inputs from the DCS, interpret them, make a prognosis, and respond through appropriate control actions. In order to perform these effectively, the operator needs to have appropriate mental models of the process. Poor mental models would increase the operator's cognitive workload and make them prone to errors. Traditionally, operator training systems are used to help operators learn appropriate mental models. However, performance assessment metrics used during training do not explicitly account for their cognitive workload while performing a task. In this work, we demonstrate that this leads to an incorrect assessment of operators’ abilities. We propose an Electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral density-based metric that can quantify the cognitive workload and provide detailed insight into the evolution of the operator's mental models during training. To demonstrate its utility, we have conducted training experiments with ten participants performing 438 tasks. Statistical studies reveal that the proposed metric can quantify the cognitive workload and therefore be used to assess operator training accurately. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Ergonomics assessment in the automotive industry has, to date, focused mainly on physical ergonomics, for example, manual handling and posture. However, workload and, in particular, metabolic and cognitive workload, contributes to worker efficiency but has not received sufficient attention to yield practical guidance for industry. Successful workload assessment requires in-depth understanding of the context in which it will be conducted and of the various assessment techniques which will be applied, with consideration given to factors such as feasibility, resources, and skill of the assessor. These requirements are met with challenges within large and complex organizations and are often dealt with in a piecemeal and isolated matter (i.e., reactive workload assessment). The present paper explores these challenges within the automotive manufacturing industry and aims to develop a decision matrix to guide effective selection of workload assessment techniques focused on metabolic and cognitive demands. It also presents the requirements for time, equipment, and knowledge to implement these techniques as part of a participatory ergonomics approach. Early findings suggest that most assessment techniques reviewed require further development, for example, to establish the acceptance criteria for the specific workload scenario. However, five methods (Garg, Borg RPE, IPAQ, SWAT, and NASA-TLX) are ready to use in certain applications. Ultimately, the findings suggest that it is possible to implement a participatory workload evaluation program within large and complex manufacturing plants. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Assembly lines with mixed products present ergonomic risks that can affect productivity of workers and lines. Because of that, the line balancing must consider the risk of injury in regard with the set of tasks necessary to process a product unit, in addition to other managerial and technological attributes such as the workload or the space. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new approach to solve the assembly line balancing problem considering temporal, spatial and ergonomic attributes at once. We formulate several mathematical models and we analyze the behavior of one of these models through case study linked to Nissan. Furthermore, we study the effect of the demand plan variations and ergonomic risk on the line balancing result. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper proposes a new type of assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem (ALWABP) which considers ergonomic risks. ALWABP occurs when task times vary according to the assigned worker. Although the operation time of a task is assumed to be fixed in classical assembly lines, it depends on the operator who executes the task in ALWABP. In ALWABP literature, the primary and secondary objectives are minimizing cycle time and balancing workload among workstations smoothly, respectively. When smoothing workload, only task times are taken into consideration in the relevant literature. However, degree of difficulty of tasks is also very important. Two workers executing two different stations with the same station time are assumed to be equally loaded according to the traditional perception. In fact, even they have the same station time; their workloads are different because of the different tasks they execute, in real life assembly line configurations. In order to close this gap between the real life and the literature, this study introduces an ALWABP problem with considering ergonomic risk factors (ErgoALWABP). Due to the complex nature of the problem, optimum seeking methods are not capable of solving it. So, the proposed problem is tackled with the multiple-rule based constructive randomized search approach. Also, OCcupational Repetitive Action method is used for making ergonomic risk assessment. Performance of the proposed solution procedure is compared with the relevant literature on benchmark data. Experimental results show that ergonomic environment could be improved when ergonomic risk factors are taken into account. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - At the mining industry, human safety and productivity are both desirable in the logistics pipeline. Since the operation of heavy machines requires continued vigilance and mental activity, fatigue caused by long hours of work and constant effort generally occurs in this environment. In general, mental fatigue is related to a loss of efficiency, leading to a decrease in productivity and inducing critical errors, which can provoke equipment breakups or accidents with human victims. At this high cognitive workload environment, there is a need for the development of robust monitoring techniques aiming to predict mental fatigue before workers' movement responses become slower, more variable, and more error-prone. In this work, we introduce a residual multilayer perceptron (MLP) network (ResMLPNet) and assess its performance in the challenging problem of mental fatigue classification from cognitive electrophysiology data, acquired during Virtual Reality (VR) training sessions mimicking a real operation faced by excavator workers at the mining industry. In a three-step training strategy, the ResMLPNet achieved slightly better classification accuracies compared to its plain MLP architecture. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Assembly lines are production lines used to manufacture products, ranging from mass-production products to mass-customisation with low unit products. Assembly lines consume the largest parts of investment funds and involve the largest proportion of companies' labour force. However, workers in assembly lines are exposed to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and ergonomics problems. Poor distribution of workloads reduces the performance of assembly lines and causes workers MSDs and injuries, largely affecting the economics of production systems and resulting in high workers' compensation and absenteeism costs. Furthermore, ergonomics problems and MSDs impact product quality and decrease productivity. We propose a methodology for taking physical ergonomics into account as early as in the design phase of assembly lines. This methodology is based on Integer Linear Programming for the assembly line balancing problem with consideration of ergonomics with a quantitative fatigue and recovery criterion. As solving approach, we develop a dedicated exact algorithm, denoted Iterative Dichotomic Search, to solve low and medium-size instances of the problem. We validate our approach by proposing numerical experiments and analysis on instances from the literature. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Ergonomics is an essential aspect to deal with while solving problems related to manual assembly, for the effects it may have on both productivity and human factor related issues. The frequent execution of repetitive movements and the handling of heavy components are among the main factors that characterize the assembly process, potentially resulting in worker's overload. An appropriate distribution of assembly operations and, therefore of relative workloads, on a production line can improve ergonomic aspects, according to the worker's anthropometric and physiological characteristics. In this paper, a multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving the assembly line balancing problem taking into account ergonomics based on energy expenditure is proposed. The novelty of the contribution relies in the assignment of assembly tasks to workstations considering a set of human operators actually available in a company. The assignment of workers is based on their physical capabilities and limits, evaluated according to their anthropometric and physiological characteristics. The objectives of the problem, besides the minimization of the number of workstations, are related to the human factor; in particular, the distribution of assembly tasks to workstations according to worker technical skills and to worker physical capabilities are optimized. A practical case study taken from the industrial reality is finally tested and discussed. © 2019 CIRP

AB  - The assembly line balancing problem arises from equally dividing the workload among all workstations. Several solution methods explore different variants of the problem, but no model includes all characteristics real assembly lines might contain. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model that solves the Traveling Worker Assembly Line Balancing Problem (TWALBP). In this problem, the tasks’ balancing along with the assignment of workers to one or more workstations is determined for a given layout. The assignment flexibility is solved with a traveling salesman problem formulation integrated in the balancing model. Adapted standard datasets and three real case scenarios are used as benchmark sets. These scenarios present particularities such as human and robotic workers, assignment restrictions, zoning constraints, automatic and common tasks. The model successfully determines the tasks’ assignments and the routing of every worker for a layout aware optimization of assembly lines. Better quality balancing solutions were achieved allowing workers to perform tasks at multiple stations, showing a trade-off between assignment flexibility and movement time. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The last years several methods and sensors have emerged for the assessment of the physical and cognitive loads that human workers experience during the execution of manufacturing tasks. Questionnaires, videos, simulation data, IMU sensors, etc. are some of the data collection methods that can provide important data for the physical (skeleton joint angles, perceived fatigue, covered distance, and so forth), as well as for the cognitive (e.g., perceived user experience, eye movement, latency of movement) workload evaluation. However, there is no commonly accepted method to guide the practitioners in selecting the appropriate method and means to evaluate their task of interest. This paper goes a step further from the existing formal guidelines by considering aspects such as the stage of development of the manufacturing tasks and weighting the cognitive and physical aspects as per the task's nature. The proposed multi-criteria decision making method will map the custom requirements of each case in terms of cost, time, expertise, and available technology to the ones that each data collection method can meet in order to suggest an appropriate method. The proposed approach is applied in a case study coming from the bus and coach sector, where a mixed task (cognitive and physical effort) is assessed using video recordings and interviews. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is one of the main challenges for companies today. Despite the trend on collaborative robots, use cases within manufacturing systems seem to be still rare. Although collaborative robots are promised to be one of the crucial innovations for ergonomically assistance for blue collar workers, the integration process into the production process and the preoccupation of workers against robot assistance alike, can be assumed as biggest challenges for companies. One of the reason might be the missing methodology and simulation tools for quick analysis of workplaces, in order to detect possible workloads for robots. The given article presents a developed learning factory seminar for students as well as industrial participants on how to integrate collaborative robots into manual assembly lines. This approach focuses on the problem based learning structure of the seminar and on the essential methods and developed concepts which are necessary to analyze workplaces, simulate robot integration with the possibility of analyzing the distributed workload between the worker and the robot. Tools as a "quick check" analysis for HRC and the simulation software Editor of manual work activities (ema) will be integrated during this concept. Besides the technological implementation and the different organization of work by implementing HRC in a production process, the participants will also discuss the affects and changes for the employees. This will cover the T-O-P (technology-organization-employee) approach [1] and will help to design an implementation project for HRC. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In modern plants with high levels of automation, acquiring an adequate mental model of the process has become a challenge for operators. Studies indicate that sub-optimal decisions occur when there is a mismatch between the demands of the process and the human's capability. This mismatch leads to high cognitive workload in human operators, often a precursor for poor performance. Recently, researchers in various safety critical domains (aviation, driving, marine, NPP, etc.) have started to explore the use of physiological measurements from humans to understand their cognitive workload and its effect. In this work, we evaluate the potential of EEG to measure cognitive workload of human operators in chemical process control room. We propose a single dry electrode EEG based methodology for identifying the similarities and mismatch between the operators’ mental model of the process and the actual process behaviour during abnormal situations. Our results reveal that SƟ(ω), the power spectral density of theta (ɵ) waves (frequency range 4–7 Hz) in the EEG signal has the potential to identify such mismatches. Results indicate that SƟ(ω) is positively correlated with workload and hence can be used for assessing the cognitive workload of operators in process industries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Line balancing and job rotation have been recently found to be effective methods to reduce workers’ ergonomic risks since the design/planning phase of assembly lines, and at the same time to limit performances deterioration and/or costs increments. As far as we know, there are no papers in the literature that deals with the problem of assigning rest times to workers in assembly lines with the aim to reduce their ergonomic workload. In the paper the problem of assigning rest times to workers in assembly lines is considered (Rest Time Assignment Problem). We show how rest times assignment affects ergonomic risk of workers in mixed-model assembly lines when this is evaluated through the Occupational Repetitive Action index (OCRA), and suggest and approach to simultaneously find solutions for the Assembly Line Balancing Problem and the Rest Time Assignment Problem. © 2018

AB  - Consideration is given to the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) in production lines employed collaborative robots. Human–robot collaboration promises high advantages in manufacturing regarding automation, productivity, accuracy as well as flexibility in production. This technology is really challenging but requires redesigning of assembly lines to effectively involve the available human- and robot-resources. As robots can collaborate with humans sharing the assembly tasks in the same workstation, production managers experience an increasingly complex ALBP setting. Moreover, a crucial issue raised within this context is the variance and uncertainty in processing times for manual (human) work. Processing times for human work are subject to the nature and skills of the human worker. We explore the heuristic solution of this NP-hard problem using a problem-specific metaheuristic. Our aim is to investigate the effects of utilizing collaborate robots in manual assembly lines with respect to both production rate and workload smoothing. Simulation experiments on a real-life case study borrowed from the literature show how to tackle the problem under uncertainty (fuzziness) in task processing times. © 2023

AB  - The concepts of Smart Production and Industry 4.0 refer to the connection of physical production with digital technology and advanced analytics to create a more holistic and flexible ecosystem. The human worker is a central element, who is mentally supported in her daily routine and decision-making processes by data-based assistive systems. Currently, there are few studies that scientifically demonstrate the effectiveness of these systems. While behavioral methods and self-report instruments are commonly used to assess cognitive workload, mental fatigue, and stress, among other variables, neurophysiological tools provide promising complementary insights. This work outlines four important application areas for the use of neurophysiology in smart production and manufacturing. The current work has the goal to instigate further research in the study domain, both theoretical and empirical. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0, the integration of human-centric considerations into manufacturing processes becomes vital. This study advances beyond conventional Industry 4.0 frameworks by introducing a novel fatigue model that emphasizes ergonomic risk management during the design phase of robotic assembly lines. Utilizing a hybrid model that employs a fuzzy inference system based on ergonomist knowledge, this fuzzy approach manages the imprecise nature of ergonomic optimization more accurately than deterministic models and effectively reflects real-world complexities. By evaluating fatigue at both task and worker levels, this fuzzy inference mechanism addresses technical aspects through feasibility studies and significantly improves ergonomic outcomes. The integration of supportive robots is explored through scenario-based analysis, highlighting productivity enhancements and substantial ergonomic benefits in line with Industry 5.0’s focus on enhancing worker well-being and operational resilience. The proposed heuristic algorithm enables decision-makers to identify the most efficient solutions tailored to individual preferences, showcasing flexibility and real-world applicability. Empirical validation, enriched with synthesized ergonomic-oriented instances, confirms the superiority of this approach in creating more sustainable and ergonomically optimized assembly lines. Implementing this approach is predicted to decrease system costs by up to 47%, particularly advantageous during human resources crises, by reducing ergonomic risk, recovery needs, and additional capacity requirements for fatigue mitigation. This study contributes to the discourse on the practical implications of Industry 5.0 and demonstrates its applicability in designing ergonomically optimized assembly lines that prioritize long-term productivity and worker satisfaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - In the past few years, collaborative robots (i.e., cobots) have been largely adopted within industrial manufacturing. Although robots can support companies and workers in carrying out complex activities and improving productivity, human factors related to cobot operators have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The present study aims to understand the subjective experience of younger and senior workers interacting with an industrial collaborative robot. Results show that workers' acceptance of cobots is high, regardless of age and control modality used. Interesting differences between seniors and younger adults emerged in the evaluations of user experience, usability, and perceived workload of participants and are detailed and commented in the last part of the work. © Chiara Rossato et al. 2021; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2021.

AB  - Construction project performance is significantly reliant on the effective communication of the project's design to the end construction worker. Spatial design is frequently represented in two-dimensional (2D) drawings of various views. These views must be combined and decoded by the end user to effectively understand all orientations of a building element and can lead to errors. Advances in three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) and 3D printing have provided promising advancements in the presentation of spatial engineering information. This research investigates cognitive-workload demands of each information format. Cognitive workload is the amount of mental resources required to complete a task from the total available mental resources. Asking subjects to complete a reconstructing task of a simple structure using 2D drawings, a 3D CAD interface, and a 3D printed model introduces the individuals to alternative forms of information presentation. After completing the task, the subjects were surveyed on their perceptions of mental workload in six main factors using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). Through a statistical analysis, there was no difference in mental workload between the three types of information presentation, indicating that the cognitive demands of the mediums are similar. However, there were statistically significant differences in workload factors due to demographic influences, such as occupation and CAD experience levels. In addition, mental workload affected the subject's productivity in task completion. The primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the investigation of mental workload as a factor in spatial understanding, and more specifically, identifying cognitive demands of individuals when presented with spatial engineering information in various formats. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Industry 4.0 technologies are key elements for companies’ competitiveness. Among these technologies, Augmented Reality (AR) already shows great potential and results to assist workers through a large panel of industrial processes. Latest research suggests that AR systems should meet the user's needs to deliver a personalized experience and therefore improve the adoption of the technology. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of theoretical guidance to design AR-based assistance capable of delivering both the right level of details of information and the best information design, based on the user's needs. To address this problematic, we developed a methodology describing the principle of adaptive assistance as well as standard characteristics and criteria to design Augmented Reality-based Adaptive Assistance Systems (ARAAS). We applied this methodology on an industrial maintenance use case in the context of landing gears’ overhaul operation. The feedbacks from different profiles of inspectors underline the usefulness of such system and its capacity to deliver an assistance adapted to their needs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In assembly line balancing problems, time is balanced among workers. This does not necessarily balance their physical effort. The effort exerted by workers varies depending on the type of the job, and the size and weight of the component. In the two-sided assembly lines, commonly used for heavy industries, the variation in physical effort among workers is more emphasized. The unbalanced effort leads to fatigue, and may lower productivity and quality. This work aims at balancing the physical effort among workers in the two-sided assembly lines, while considering other conventional objectives. A genetic algorithm and a new decoding scheme are proposed. An effort smoothness index (ESI) is introduced to measure the variation in effort among workers. Results prove that balancing the physical effort is influential and can be achieved at no extra cost for most cases. Effort balancing is harder to achieve in difficult problems; of high order of strength. © 2021 THE AUTHORS

AB  - In this paper we present a method to predict cognitive workload during the interaction with a tablet computer. To set up a predictor that estimates the reflected self-reported cognitive workload we analyzed the information gain of heart rate, electrodermal activity and user input (touch) based features. From the derived optimal feature set we present a Gaussian Process based learner that enables fine-grained and short term detection of cognitive workload. Average inter-subject accuracy in 10-fold cross validation is 74.1 % for the fine-grained 5-class problem and 96.0 % for the binary class problem.

AB  - At manufacturing sites, mass customization is expanding along with the increasing variety of customer needs. This situation leads to complications in production planning for the factory manager, and production plans are likely to change suddenly at the manufacturing site. Because such sudden fluctuations in production often occur, it is particularly difficult to optimize the parts supply operations in these production processes. As a solution to such problems, Industry 4.0 has expanded to promote the use of digital technologies at manufacturing sites; however, these solutions can be expensive and time-consuming to introduce. Therefore, not all factory managers are favorable toward introducing digital technology. In this study, we propose a method to support parts supply operations that decreases work stagnation and fluctuation without relying on the experience of workers who supply parts in the various production processes. Furthermore, we constructed a system that is inexpensive and easy to introduce using both LPWA and BLE communications. The purpose of the system is to level out work in in-process logistics. In an experiment, the proposed method was introduced to a manufacturing site, and we compared how the workload of the site's workers changed. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for workload leveling in parts supply operations. © 2023 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - This paper investigates Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Balancing Problem (ALWABP), focusing specifically on productive workload differences due to age and gender of workers, to minimize the number of workstations. Most of the published papers on assembly line balancing problems (ALBP) are focused only on the task processing times. However, this may cause an overload in work assignments for certain workers. A work-overload may cause fatigue and thus lead to a decrease in line efficiency and factory productivity, and also result in an increase in quality problems and work-related injuries. To avoid the negative implications of work-overload conditions, this paper assigns tasks among workstations without exceeding the cycle time or the age and gender-adjusted physical workload capacity (PWLC). We propose a regression model to determine age and gender-based PWLC. Six different age categories are analyzed to show the impacts of age and gender on PWLC. We propose a binary (0-1) integer linear programming (BILP) for ALWABP, where age and gender-adjusted PWLC is considered. The efficiency of the model is shown on test problems and a real-life application in a textile firm. An ALWABP is considered taking into account the processing times and physical workloads for a textile factory assembly line of 53 tasks. The numbers of stations for ALWABP without and with the physical workload in the textile firm assembly line case are 5 and 6, respectively. All workstations are balanced in terms of physical workload and processing times. The results show that advancing average age increases the number of stations (NS), and this situation triggers a reduction in line efficiency (LE) and PWLC utilization ratio. © International Journal of Industrial Engineering.

AB  - Automatization, robotics and Industry 4.0 are deeply modifying the working condition with an expected reduction of the number of workers employed in traditional job and an increasing request of new professions. Despite these technologies could limit the involvement of workers, in some sectors humans are still widely employed, as in assembly line of manufacturing companies. As a consequence of this, the Human Factor (HF) will still have relevant influence in term efficiency, quality and safety performances. This paper approached the HF analysis into the manufacturing field in an assembly line. This study was focused on the analysis of those human-skills that are mainly solicited by the workload of the task that a worker has to perform during his own working activity. A set of practical test was designed and used to measure those skills during the real working activity. Results showed a wide range of performances reflecting different levels of skills between workers. This kind of information can support the human resources management because it allowed a worker classification based on their own skills. This classification can be directly applied to optimize the allocation of workers in assembly line with the using of Human Performance model and it can lead the way to a personalized risk assessment based on personal skills evaluation. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

AB  - Monitoring and classifying cognitive workload in real time is vital for optimizing human–machine interactions and enhancing performance while ensuring safety, particularly in industrial scenarios. Considering this significance, the authors aim to formulate a cognitive workload monitoring system (CWMS) by leveraging the deep gated neural network (DGNN), a hybrid model integrating bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. In our experimental setup, each of the four virtual users is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W module to ensure efficient data transmission, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficacy of the monitoring process. This seamless monitoring framework utilizes the constrained application protocol (CoAP) and the Things Board platform to evaluate cognitive workload in real time. The most popular EEG benchmark dataset, the STEW is utilized for workload classification in this study. We employ the short-time Fourier transformation (STFT) to extract frequency bands corresponding to users in both high and low cognitive workload modes. The proposed DGNN models achieve a perfect accuracy of 99.45%, outperforming every previous state-of-the-art model. We meticulously monitored critical parameters, including latency, classification processing time, and cognitive workload levels. This research demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring for increasing productivity and safety in industries by introducing a novel method of real-time cognitive workload monitoring. The implementation codes for each experiment are documented and made available for reproducibility. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The forestry industry is one of the most hazardous industries in New Zealand, and the physical and cognitive fatigue of forestry workers has been shown to contribute to this. Physical and cognitive fatigue can be exacerbated by prolonged physical and cognitive workload. As such, we propose that the identification and mitigation of fatigue factors could reduce the risk of incident and injury in hazardous work environments. This paper introduces a semantic model for workload categorization. The model takes as input, a set of multi-modal physiological measurements, and uses parallel processing, complex event processing, and rule-based modelling to categorize a series of workloads (resting, cognitive workload, and physical workload). The model has undergone a set of evaluations, including categorization accuracy, and performance. The model has been tested under three scenarios: when a participant is resting and refraining from any physically or mentally demanding tasks; when a participant is undertaking a cognitively intensive task; and when a participant is walking, jogging, and running. The study has been conducted with participants between the ages of 22 and 39 and has shown an average accuracy of 89% for resting workload, 76% for cognitive workload, and 97% for physical workload. Finally, in this paper we discuss the application and extension of this model to predict fatigue in hazardous industries. The work described in this paper contributes to a larger research project centered on investigating technology uses in hazardous work environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The human‐centered design (HCD) approach places humans at the center of design in order to improve both products and processes, and to give users an effective, efficient and satisfy-ing interactive experience. In industrial design and engineering, HCD is very useful in helping to achieve the novel Industry 5.0 concept, based on improving workers’ wellbeing by providing prosperity beyond jobs and growth, while respecting the production limits of the planet as recently promoted by the European Commission. In this context, the paper proposes an ergonomic assessment method based on the analysis of the workers’ workload to support the design of industrial products and processes. This allows the simultaneous analysis of the physical and cognitive workload of operators while performing their tasks during their shift. The method uses a minimum set of non‐invasive wearable devices to monitor human activity and physiological parameters, in addition to questionnaires for subjective self‐assessment. The method has been preliminarily tested on a real industrial case in order to demonstrate how it can help companies to support the design of optimized products and processes promoting the workers’ wellbeing. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This research discussed balancing operator workload on the automotive industry assembly line by developing a novel job rotation mathematical model using mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) method that aims to obtain optimal job rotation design results by considering ergonomic aspects. The implementation of job rotation in workforce planning is carried out by manufacturing industry to reduce musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) risk factors. Ergonomic analysis was carried out at each workstation to evaluate the physical workload of various jobs, in which the results were used as the parameters of the job rotation mathematical model developed in this research to schedule optimal job rotation and achieve a balanced cumulative workload. Ergonomics aspect was considered in designing the job rotation model to prevent sequentially high workload exposure for an operator and also adjust the operator's capacity to do work at the workstation because it will be related to additional training costs and time consequences. The result of job rotation programming in this research is the optimal work order for each worker so that the global daily workload will be balanced. The job rotation strategy proposed in this research succeeded in reducing the spread and deviation of the cumulative daily workload among workers by decreasing the standard deviation from 10.73 to 0.32, proving that the physical workload is equally distributed among operators. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In the manufacturing industry, assembly processes involve most of the workforce to deal with the many manual operations. Thus, the design of workplaces must take into account ergonomics to promote workers well-being and safeguard their health and safety, also enhancing productivity. The occupational ergonomic risk not only depends on the physical workload of a task, but also on environmental characteristics of the workplace, including noise, the assessment of which may contribute to prevent workers from possible health issues associated to hearing injuries. In this regard, the present study proposes a software tool based on a genetic algorithm for solving the mixed-model assembly line balancing problem with job rotation and collaborative robots to improve workers’ ergonomics, for the evaluation of which noise exposure is also considered. In particular, the objectives of the problem concern economic aspects, which are taken into account through the optimization of the cost of the line, and ergonomics, which is pursued by reducing and smoothing both workers’ energy expenditure and noise exposure for performing operations on the line. To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an industrial case study is finally discussed. © 2022 CIRP

AB  - In stable circumstances, assembly lines have workers with different capabilities assigned to stations. They perform a set of specialised tasks multiple times daily. Under a situation of high demand disruption (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic), the overproduction rate would lead inventory levels to soar. An approach to cope with these demand drops and ongoing workforce costs is to dismiss employees and rebalance the line. Nevertheless, this implies social and economic costs related to rehiring and training. Alternatively, agreements can be made to reduce workload with a proportional wage deduction. These decisions are particularly challenging in heterogeneous workforces. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to address the Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Rebalancing Problem (ALWARP). Our model aims at preserving jobs while minimising labour costs. We consider scenarios with falling demands and impose regularity metrics on workload reductions. Computational tests on benchmark datasets show that our strategy can distribute social costs among workers, with only slightly higher cumulative labour hours, while avoiding inconveniences associated with future renovations. A real-world case study of a truck cabin assembly line is investigated: the model can easily incorporate many realistic features and decide which workers should have their workload reduced and at which rate. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The increasing complexity and demands of assembly operations in manufacturing has been shown to lead to increased cognitive load in assembly workers. Previous work has outlined the complexity of an assembly worker's situation both in terms of difficulty and speed of work and there have been a few attempts at creating frameworks and methods for understanding the key aspects of what creates increased cognitive load. This paper presents a tool for assessing cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly. The paper presents the method and an accompanying tool as well as some insights derived from this method development. The intended contribution of the work is to make a difference in reducing the cognitive load of assembly workers on the shop floor, thus focusing the development on applicability and usability of the tool in practice. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - The shift from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 has led to a greater focus on workers' needs in the workplace. Collaborative robots have been introduced to promote a fair division of tasks and reduce physical and mental strain on workers. However, there is a lack of research on how to implement human-centered task allocation. This study proposes a model for multi-objective task allocation, including minimizing makespan, energy expenditure, and mental workload. The study also suggests a method for evaluating mental workload. Results show that the strictness of task sequence affects makespan and energy expenditure, and a new constraint related to idle times is proposed. The optimal level of worker saturation is one that minimizes makespan while minimizing increases in energy expenditure and mental workload. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Human augmentation technologies can strengthen and compensate for the lack of human abilities associated with aging and physical disabilities. Efforts have been made to apply these technologies in manufacturing and agricultural industries to improve work efficiency, reduce fatigue, and cover differences in workers’ skills. This study proposes a human augmentation hand to assist users in performing intelligent tasks requiring high brain functions, such as cognition, planning, judgment, and memory. Solving a dissection puzzle is used as an example of an intelligent task. The human augmentation hand has a view of the puzzle blocks with an attached camera, and the puzzle blocks required for solving the dissection puzzle are derived using a full-search algorithm. The system can then provide user hints for solving puzzles and assist in handling puzzle blocks. An experiment is conducted to confirm the operation of the system and examine its usefulness. A National Aeronautics and Space Administration task load index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire is used to investigate the subjective workload perceived by users. The experimental results reveal that the proposed system improves task efficiency and reduces workloads that require high brain functions. © 2024, International Society of Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB).

AB  - In a paced aircraft final assembly line, some disturbances can be collected timely on the basis of the cyber-physical production system. In order to reduce the execution deviation, some workers need to switch among stations after a fixed period. Thus, a worker allocation problem with the multistage workstation is introduced first. Then, an integer programming formulation is presented to formulate the problem with the objective of shortest workstation cycle and the workload balance of both stations and workers. Moreover, a modified nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-IV) is proposed to solve it, which tradeoff the convergence and the population diversity in the decision space. Finally, the NSGA-IV algorithm compares with five multiobjective evolutionary algorithms in a real-world case. Compared with manual allocation, the takt time of an aircraft final assembly line is reduced by 20.86% by using the NSGA-IV algorithm. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents an efficient way of monitoring and controlling the stress levels of workers in factories and shop floor, by real time measurement of eye par ameters to avoid accidents and injuries to man and machine. Occupational stresses generate both positive and venomous effect. The Index of Cognitive Activity is a measure of cognitive work load that can be determined by analyzing the pupil data obtained from eye trackers, involving the use of highly sophisticated cameras and eye trackers in MATLAB Wavelet Tool Box. The paper also encompasses a unique hardware and software module, developed and programmed for eye tracking of the workers who are under stress condition. The analysis results are discussed to minimization the accidents caused due to overstress in workers and suggestions are provided to determine the stress level and mental alertness level of workers easily. On implementation of the measurement technique, it must be made mandatory for all workers involved in complex and hazardous manufacturing operations since all these operations have high quantum of risk to them. The workers under stress and those who have excessive cognitive workload can be identified and proper remedial action like relieving the worker or providing assistance to the workers may be done appropriately. © 2014 Research India Publications.

AB  - The aim of study is to suggest a job rotation schedule by developing a mathematical model in order to reduce cumulative workload from the successive use of the same body region. Workload assessment using rapid entire body assessment (REBA) was performed for the model in three automotive assembly lines of chassis, trim, and finishing to identify which body part exposed to relatively high workloads at workstations. The workloads were incorporated to the model to develop a job rotation schedule. The proposed schedules prevent the exposure to high workloads successively on the same body region and minimized between-worker variance in cumulative daily workload. Whereas some of workers were successively assigned to high workload workstation under no job rotation and serial job rotation. This model would help to reduce the potential for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) without additional cost for engineering work, although it may need more computational time and relative complex job rotation sequences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - In response to the demand for mass personalised manufacturing in Industry 5.0, we propose a novel human-centric cognitive assistive assembly system. This system is engineered to enhance assembly efficiency by offering workers contextual instructions. These instructions are dynamically generated based on real-time analysis of worker's actions and task progress, effectively reducing cognitive load and improving workflow efficiency. Leveraging and advancing cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning technologies, our system accurately identifies human activities during assembly. The recognised action integrates with a reference task graph to provide feedback, including step-by-step assembly guidance, future action suggestions, and progress updates via intuitive augmented reality overlays directly on the workbench. Our results demonstrate the capability of our system in assembly activity recognition, thereby ensuring precise guidance tailored to workers' performance. The proposed assistive assembly system enables a human-centric assembly scenario which reduces worker stress through straightforward, intuitive support and improves assembly efficiency through adaptive instructions. This research contributes to the evolving field of personalised manufacturing, highlighting the synergy between human skills and digital augmentation in advanced manufacturing environments. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Collaborative robots are revolutionising the manufacturing industry and the way workers perform their tasks. When designing shared workspaces between robots and humans, human factors and ergonomics are often overlooked. This study assessed the relationship between cognitive workload, workstation design, user acceptance and trust in collaborative robots. We combined subjective and objective data to evaluate the cognitive workload during an assembly task in three different scenarios in which we manipulated various features of the workstation and interaction modalities. Our results showed that participants experienced a reduction in cognitive workload in each of the three trials, indicating an improvement in cognitive performance. Additionally, we found that user acceptance predicted perceived stress across the trials but did not significantly impact the cognitive workload. Trust was not found to moderate the relationship between cognitive workload and perceived stress. This study has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of collaborative assembly systems by providing valuable insights and helping to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners. This study can potentially impact companies looking to improve safety, productivity and efficiency. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Digitalisation and the introduction of smart manufacturing technologies are changing the shape of industrial shop floors. For manufacturing companies, it becomes imperative to assess the operational and economic advantages derived from these technologies. Simultaneously, in alignment with the Industry 5.0 paradigm, understanding the influence of digital technologies on human workers, especially those directly interacting with these technologies, is equally critical. This study focuses on augmented reality (AR) as a specific technology, conducting an experimental campaign to explore its effects on learning curves and cognitive workload. Voluntary participants engaged in learning manual tasks of varying durations and required dexterity. This study evaluates the impact of AR on the mental workload of operators, utilising two main eye-related measures: fixation duration and pupil diameter. Preliminary results indicate that augmented reality increases the cognitive workload of workers undergoing training.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The recent pandemic and associated hybrid work culture reignites the importance of extended reality (XR) technologies for remote collaboration across the world. As different ranges of automation are introduced in the industry with an increasing focus on digitalization, safety, and productivity, it is important to understand the context and physiological metrics of existing human operators. This paper describes the implementation of a virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) interface of a welding process and compares operators' performance using such technologies. Initially, MR and VR were compared with respect to a pointing task followed by a welding task involving trajectory definition and actual robotic arm movement. A plethora of parameters involving ocular data, Electroencephalography (EEG), hand movement, subjective opinion and quantitative measures were recorded and analyzed. The results of physiological parameters such as EEG based Task Load Index, Task Engagement Index, ocular fixation rate and average fixation duration indicated that the VR interaction involved higher levels of engagement, lower mental processing load and distinct visual processing mechanisms in the optical cortex compared to the MR interaction. Similar comparison trends observed in these parameters across both tasks confirmed the reproducibility of the experiment methodology and results. Results from the study can be used in terms of selecting rendering media for other immersive applications such as teleoperation, path planning and navigation scenarios in multiple domains such as manufacturing, robotics, healthcare, and education. The results were used to develop a multi-modal VR interface with a novel collision-based weld path definition method suitable for industrial deployment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - This review paper examines the role of physiological monitoring techniques in the manufacturing industry, particularly through the use of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Electroencephalography (EEG), aligning with the human-centric approach of Industry 5.0. Delving into the current applications and potential of these biometric tools, the paper highlights their significance in enhancing worker well-being, safety, cognitive workload management, and the optimisation of human-machine interactions. A systematic literature search employing the PRISMA framework was conducted, revealing a marked preference for HRV over EEG in current research, although both have been shown to offer substantial benefits. The review underscores the precision of ECG-based HRV measurements as pivotal for assessing autonomic nervous system activity, with implications for employee health outcomes. The analysis of EEG studies reflects its utility in mapping psychological states and fostering advanced Brain-Computer Interface technologies, contributing to safer and more efficient manufacturing processes. As the review concludes, the integration of HRV and EEG monitoring is poised to become a standard practice within the industry, signalling a shift towards manufacturing operations that prioritize the health and satisfaction of the workforce while maintaining operational excellence. The findings advocate for the adoption of these monitoring techniques as part of a larger strategy to ensure a responsive, adaptive, and worker-centric manufacturing environment. This paper paves the way for future research to explore the full spectrum of possibilities that HRV and EEG monitoring hold for the evolution of the manufacturing sector. © (2024), (Penerbit UTHM).

AB  - Industry 5.0 addresses the human challenges of Industry 4.0 as a human-centric solution, placing the worker's well-being at the centre of the production process. If, on the one hand, the last technologies support operator 5.0 to embrace the collaborative potential of human-machine cooperation, on the other hand, the complexity, as well as the rapid evolution of new technologies, could have the potential to produce immediate stress reaction leading to reduce the workers' well-being. Recent studies have proved that the maintenance area is experiencing many innovations in terms of approaches and technologies. In this field, the rapid progress of technological equipment is leading to an increase in the human operators' mental workload. This paper presents preliminary concepts and objectives of a Decision Support System (DSS) for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Maintenance Operations. The DSS intends to assist industrial professionals and stakeholders in maintenance tasks characterised by significant cognitive demands. Considering variables such as task complexity and the mental and physical condition of operators involved in a maintenance task, the DSS will provide real-time recommendations for selecting the most suitable operators by promoting a gradual technology introduction, increasing industrial performance, and ensuring the well-being of the workers.

AB  - In factories of the future, advanced automation systems (e.g., cobots, exoskeletons, cyber physical systems) will reduce the physical effort of workers and compensate their limitations as well as ensure more flexibility, agility, and competitiveness. However, the activities of the operator 4.0 will entail an increased share of complex cognitive tasks. Therefore, monitoring the mental load will be increasingly important to ensure work environments that promote healthy life and wellbeing for all at all ages. For this aim, this paper proposes a framework to analyze heart rate, galvanic skin response and electrooculogram signals in order to extract features able to detect an excessive stress or cognitive load. Two wearable devices are used: Empatica E4 wristband and J!NS MEME electrooculography glasses. The proposed framework has been experimented through a laboratory test focused on LEGO brick-based simulations of manufacturing activities. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The manufacturing sector has always been at the heart of technological advances. In the manufacturing setting, labor's variety addresses a critical challenge for organizations, particularly those characterized by high worker turnover and manual cycles that involve high physical workload like in assembly lines. In this paper, sustainability is addressed in the manufacturing system especially in assembly lines. It is known with its 3 aspects: social, economic and environmental. In this study, social aspect is treated by considering the worker's tiredness in assembly lines. To explain the problem, an illustrative example is given to show the importance of the worker's tiredness in determining their salaries. Two distinct assignment scenarios are examined revealing that opting for a specific type of resource results in cost savings compared to utilizing diverse resources. Additionally, this last choice enhances the operator's working comfort. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The world is now witnessing the 4th industrial revolution technology and this is commonly known as Industry 4.0. This study focuses on developing a prototype to demonstrate the smart production line by using Industry 4.0 elements for apparel manufacturing which captures the cycle times of garment assembly operations and balance workloads. As the key elements. Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Big data were involved to convert a traditional assembly line to a smart assembly line. The developed prototype allows to capture cycle times of operations and sends those data to a cloud through a wireless network. The data stored in the cloud compute the required arithmetic to draw Yamazumi work balance chart which is dynamically updated without human intervention. A computer client application attached to the cloud act as a decision support system which helps production management to make decisions efficiently. As the special features, the proposed system is also compatible with walking worker production lines where operators are moving from one workstation to another, which also captures actual utilization of the worker at different workstations along the production line which is harder to capture accurately in the actual production scenario. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - With the progressive digitalization in industrial manufacturing, the usage of complex robotic systems in both intralogistics and production is expected to increase. This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program-synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the programming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in parallel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid advances in digitization technologies are changing modern working conditions especially in industrial settings. Consequently, employees are confronted with new forms of human–machine interaction. Whether changes in working conditions in general, and the increasing relevance of human–machine interaction in particular, affect psychosocial working conditions, and employee's health is currently matter of debate, but empirical data are lacking. Therefore, we conducted semistructured interviews with 36 employees working in five different companies. The interviews were aimed at identifying potential stressors associated with the introduction and use of modern technologies in the manufacturing industry. The results show that stressors linked to human–machine interaction are technical problems, poor usability, low situation awareness, and increased requirements on employees' qualification. For example, technical problems such as breakdowns or slowdowns were described as a main stressor when employees were not qualified to handle these problems on their own, thus decelerating work flows and causing additional time pressure. Overall, the results show that problems in human–machine interaction, which have been observed in laboratory and nonindustrial settings, also apply to industrial work places with highly automated working conditions and are a potential source of stress. These factors should be considered in psychosocial risk assessment of work-related stressors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This work provides a methodological framework to introduce the CoBots into an assembly line to facilitate an assembly line worker. The CoBots are to facilitate an assembly line worker working long or providing assistance during a work-fatigue condition by sharing their workload. A conceptual framework is given to split an assembly task into seven sub-tasks then collaboration possibilities are proposed to provide sub-task level assistance. An appropriate framework is provided for utilising the collaboration possibilities to increase an assembly line worker's comfortable work duration time and reduce the worker work rotations between work breaks or model changeovers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - When allocating tasks within U-shaped assembly lines, the ignorance of heterogeneous workers may result in the unaccomplishment of workload for the lack of skills and even cause the current task assignment infeasible. Thus, this paper optimizes worker assignment and task allocation within U-shaped assembly lines concurrently via an iterated greedy algorithm. In the algorithm, both task assignment and worker allocation vectors are embedded for the concurrent optimization and multiple heuristic rules are employed to extend the diversity of elements in the initial solution. A specified number of tasks and workers are extracted and reinserted respectively in destruction and construction phases for further exploration and exploitation. And the acceptance criterion is modified based on the temperature in simulated annealing algorithm to avoid trapping into local optima. Compared with optimal solutions by GAMS/Cplex and near-optimal solutions by particle swarm optimization of the benchmark problems, computational studies indicate that the iterated greedy algorithm shows excellent performance for small-scaled, middle-scaled and large-scaled benchmark problems. © 2018, ICIC Express Letters Office.

AB  - A type II line balancing problem with multiple workers in workstations (mALBP-II) is considered given a total number of workers, group workers, and tasks into workstations so as to minimize cycle time. Different from the manufacturing environment where the traditional assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) rises, manual or semimanual manufacturing enjoys much higher flexibility allowing multiple workers to perform the same set of tasks on workpieces in the same workstation in parallel. The freedom of specifying the number of workers in workstations makes the classic NP-hard ALBP even harder to solve. A heuristic-mixed genetic algorithm (hGA) is therefore proposed to solve the problem. The algorithm minimizes cycle time as its first objective and balances workload among workstations as its second objective. A maximum-utilization heuristic and a bisection search are integrated into the decoding process of hGA so that the optimization of task assignment and worker allocation is accomplished simultaneously. Numerical results and a real-life application demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of hGA.  © 2022 Xiongwen Qian.

AB  - Introduction: PT. Pertamina RU IV Cilacap is a national oil and gas industry that has the largest refinery in Southeast Asia that manages raw materials for other refinery units in Indonesia to be reprocessed into fuel. The size of the refinery can illustrate the complexity of the system run by this unit. The HSE Unit in this company has a great responsibility to maintain the worker safety in the refinery. It is necessary to measure mental workload on HSE workers. This is because if the mental workload is not monitored, it can cause fatality, in this case, work accidents as a result of lack of supervision from HSE workers and mental PAK related to HSE workers resulting in excessive mental workload or property loss as an outcome of excessive mentel workload. So, it is important to portray the HSE mental workload because of its responsibility to secure the health, safety and environmental issues. The purpose of this study was to describe the heavy mentei workload on PT. Pertamina RU IV Cilacap. Method: This research was a quantitative descriptive designed study. Data were obtained by conducting interviews and using the NASA-tlx questionnaire on 71 respondents. Results: As many as 35 respondents had heavy mental workloads and 31 respondents had very heavy mental workloads. Conclusion: HSE workers at PT. Pertamina RU IV Cilacap has a heavy mental workload and even tends to be very heavy. © 2020 IJOSH All right reserved.

AB  - In this study, an integrated bi-objective objective U-shaped assembly line balancing and parts feeding problem is explored by considering the heterogeneity inherent of workers. An optimization model is developed to formulate the addressed problem. Since the problem includes two different objectives, namely the minimizing the operational cost and maximum workload imbalance, the Pareto-optimal solutions are found by employing the second version of the augmented ε-constrained (AUGMECON2) method. To investigate the impact of qualification of workers on the system performance, a set of scenarios is constructed based on the worker skill levels. Each scenario is determined based on the nature of the worker pool in which workers are assigned to the stations. The optimization model and implemented method are validated through data taken from water-meter and elevator producers. The computational results reveal that the scenarios have a great impact on system performance. In particular, it is revealed that as the skill levels of workers increases, the quality of the Pareto-optimal solutions increase by up to 30% in terms of the comparison metrics. Therefore, an order release mechanism and worker training activities are suggested to be performed to enhance system performance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The current situation in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 has demonstrated that the most affected category of citizens (in terms of morbidity and mortality) around the world are healthcare workers. High workloads, the risk of infection and death from coronavirus against the background of sometimes insufficient protection, both physically and socially, leads to the fact that the risks of an increase in the outflow of medical workers from the industry and an increase in the personnel shortage. Most of the states agreed to provide medical workers with a wide range of benefits, guarantees and compensations. At the same time, measures to support medical workers are important not only in themselves, but also as a tool for managing personnel in the industry. This publication examines the experience of the Russian Federation in state support for persons associated with the treatment of coronavirus infection, including in comparison with the experience of some other countries. An assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of using various measures to support medical workers is given and the conclusion is substantiated that in order to improve the staffing of health care to improve the quality of provided medical services, it is necessary, if possible, to “monetize” benefits and guarantees. Extensive opportunities for this are opened on the basis of industrial and manufacturing engineering of digital healthcare. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Head-mounted augmented reality (HMD AR) technology in construction has shown promise in enhancing operational efficiency. Concurrently, the critical role of hazard identification (HI) in ensuring worker safety is well-documented. Despite this, studies delving into HMD AR's impact on HI, especially across varying task complexities, are limited. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the influence of HMD AR on construction workers' HI in diverse task environments. The research engaged 48 participants in an experiment to evaluate their hazard situation awareness (HSA), cognitive load (CL), and task performance (TP). These were assessed using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), the Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and measures of task accuracy. Findings indicated that environmental conditions significantly modulate HMD AR's effect on HI. In simple and safe scenes, HMD AR has a negligible impact on HI and might enhance hazard detection capabilities. However, in complex and hazardous situations with intense workloads, HMD AR can impair HI, potentially increasing safety risks. In other words, whether HMD AR brings opportunities or risks for HI depends on the different environmental conditions. This research contributes to the nascent field of cognitive safety in HMD AR, specifically regarding HI in construction, augmenting the current understanding and laying a theoretical groundwork for HMD AR's future safety applications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The insights gained inform the prudent implementation, training, and interface design of HMD AR on construction sites. In the context of HMD AR's rapid evolution, this study underscores the importance of critically assessing safety implications to guide the responsible utilization of new technologies. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Due to high demand for workers and limited technology management in Indonesia, the industries need to focus on increasing worker's productivity in this labour-intensive system. Such system has the inclination to use workers to actuate the economic cycle. But in employing human workers, we will face the problem of fatigue. This research identifies factors affecting fatigue recovery of workers and obtained the mathematical model for it. The model was built using the experimental design method that involved three workers with age ranging from 20 to 22 years and obtained that variable of activity, treatment and operator have closely related to fatigue recovery. The mathematical model was obtained as equation of Y=-13,856+15,515X1+2,736X2+3,674X3 with X1 is variable of activity, X2 is variable of treatment and X3 is variable of operator. The results of this research would become an indicator for the manufacturing industries in Indonesia to increase labour's productivity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Ergonomic aspects have a crucial role in manual assembly systems. They impact on the workers’ health, final product quality and productivity. For these reasons, there is the necessity to integrate them into the assembly line balancing phase as, whereas, only time and cost variables are considered. In this study, human energy expenditures are considered as ergonomic aspects and we integrate them, for the first time, into the assembly line balancing problem type 2 through the rest allowance evaluation. We consider as an objective function the minimization of the smoothness index. Firstly, a new optimal method based on mixed integer linear programming and a new linearization methodology are proposed. Then, a heuristic approach is introduced. To complete the study, a computational experimentation is presented to validate the mathematical model and to compare the methodologies proposed in terms of computational time, complexity and solution. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the impact that rest allowance evaluation can have on productivity comparing the results obtained, taking into account the rest allowance integration before, during and after the assembly balancing process. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Human error is one of the primary reasons for accidents in complex industries like aviation, nuclear power plant management, and health care. Physical and cognitive workload, flawed information processing, and poor decision making are some of the reasons that make humans vulnerable to error and lead to failures and accidents. In many accidents and failures, oftentimes, vulnerabilities that are embedded in the system, in the form of design deficiencies and poor human factors, lead to latent or catastrophic failures, but the last link is a human operator who gets blamed or worse, injured. This paper introduces an early design human performance assessment framework to identify what type of digital prototyping methodologies are appropriate to detect the deviation of the operator's performance due to an emergency condition. Fire in a civilian aircraft cockpit was introduced as a performance shaping factor (PSF). Ergonomics performance was evaluated using two prototyping strategies: (1) a computational prototyping framework includes digital human modeling (DHM) and computer-aided design; and (2) a novel mixed prototyping framework includes motion capture, DHM, and virtual reality. Results showed that the mixed prototyping framework can simulate emergency scenarios with increased realism and also has the potential to incorporate subjective aspects of ergonomics outcomes, overcoming the underlying lack of design knowledge in conventional early design methodologies. © 2020 ASME.

AB  - Due to mass customization product variety increased steeply in the automotive industry, entailing the increment of worker’s cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Although worker assistance methods for cognitive automation already exist, they proof insufficient in terms of usability and achieved time saving. Given the rising importance of simulation towards autonomous production planning, a novel approach is proposed using human simulation data in context of worker assistance methods to alleviate cognitive load during manual assembly tasks. Within this paper, a new concept for augmented reality-based worker assistance is presented. Additionally, a comparative user study (N=24) was conducted with conventional worker assistance methods to evaluate a prototypical implementation of the concept. The results illustrate the enhancing opportunity of the novel approach to save cognitive abilities and to induce performance improvements. The implementation provided stable information presentation during the entire experiment. However, with regard to the recentness, there has to be carried out further developments and research, concerning performance adaptions and investigations of the effectiveness. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - From paper-based and face-to-face workshops to electronic and digital simulated educational programs, vast amounts are spent to train workers to perform assembly-tasks, especially in manufacturing. This need for robust, cost-effective, adaptable learning environments supported the rise of Immersive Training. The phenomenon of utilizing the immersive capabilities of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to construct learning environments, i.e. Immersive Training, has flourished, mainly due to the rise and availability of commercial headsets and applications. In this paper, we describe and analyze two such scenarios, a VR lab experiment created to test the VR capabilities in training and a field study exploring the use of AR in a large manufacturing company. Our results provide a) guidelines on how to set up such experiments, b) indicate the temporal demand, and accuracy as significant improvements in VR and c) indicate the effort, physical demand and the time performance in AR. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This study explores the impact of augmented reality (AR) on worker performance in manufacturing contexts through an analysis of case studies extant in the literature. Two specific analyses were conducted to assess the impacts of AR technologies on worker performance in terms of objective and subjective metrics, and in terms of their age, experience with the task and experience with the AR device. Regarding objective metrics, the results showed that the task completion time was reduced for some AR devices (projectors, monitors, tablets, smartphones), whereas the use of the head-mounted display (HMD) increased task-completion time; moreover, the error rate was reduced with any AR device compared with traditional methods. Regarding subjective metrics, the analysis underlined that operator perceived a lower workload with the HMD or the monitor compared with traditional methods. The age of operators did not influence performance, while the operators’ experience allowed for the improvement of human performance. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Human operator-induced assembly errors affect the quality of car manufacturing. Understanding the factors influencing assembly errors is critical for quality improvement. The sequence of assembly operations, a factor markedly affecting cognitive load, remains largely understudied. We aimed to assess the effect of changing the sequence of assembly operations on error rates through four field experiments conducted in a car manufacturing plant. The parts (and errors) under study were child lock labels (missing labels), sunroofs (missing bolts), windshield wiper arms (loose bolts), and armrests (wrong selection). Parts were chosen based on data from quality records, and they represent different scenarios regarding the sequencing of assembly operations. Minitab was used to conduct the statistical test for two proportions at a significance level of 0.05. The experiments ran for a period varying from 9 to 25 weeks (22292 to 138456 cars). All four experiments exhibited significant differences in the proportion of errors. MODAPTS cycle-time calculations revealed no negative effect of assembly sequence variations on productivity. The study findings show that changing the assembly operation sequence can reduce the error rates, possibly due to the intermediary effect in reducing the operator's cognitive load. Overall, realizing quality improvement requires optimizing the assembly operation sequence in terms of time and productivity while considering its possible impact on error rates.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Collaborative robots represent a clear added value to manufacturing, as they promise to increase productivity and improve working conditions of such environments. Although modern robotic systems have become safe and reliable enough to operate close to human workers on a day-to-day basis, the workload is still skewed in favor of a limited contribution from the robot's side, and a significant cognitive load is allotted to the human. We believe the transition from robots as recipients of human instruction to robots as capable collaborators hinges around the implementation of transparent systems, where mental models about the task are shared between peers, and the human partner is freed from the responsibility of taking care of both actors. In this work, we implement a transparent task planner able to be deployed in realistic, near-future applications. The proposed framework is capable of basic reasoning capabilities for what concerns role assignment and task allocation, and it interfaces with the human partner at the level of abstraction he is most comfortable with. The system is readily available to non-expert users, and programmable with high-level commands in an intuitive interface. Our results demonstrate an overall improvement in terms of completion time, as well as a reduced cognitive load for the human partner. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The research aims to investigate the impact of automation-induced mental workload (MWL) on worker performance and well-being. By leveraging AI techniques, it seeks to develop proactive strategies for managing MWL and optimizing human-machine collaboration in transformative factories. Drawing inspiration from Design Thinking, the development process involves creating a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for an AI-based tool capable of real-time MWL assessment, prediction, and countermeasure suggestion. The PoC framework delineates three stages: real-time MWL assessment, prediction, and countermeasure suggestion. Data collection involves subjective, objective, and scenario-based metrics, including EEG signals and NASA Task Load Index ratings. The experimental protocol includes individual calibration sessions and workload assessments to validate the PoC's feasibility. The research presents a pioneering PoC for AI-driven MWL management, offering real-time insights and interventions to enhance operator performance and well-being. The study advocates for continued collaboration and innovation to address the multifaceted challenges of MWL management in automated environments. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Since ergonomic risks related to the tasks performed by each worker are generally neglected when solving the Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem (SALBP) or partially treated in post-processing, this paper aims to incorporate ergonomic issues natively in the decision process (ErgoSALBP). For such a problem, we present a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that linearizes and incorporates into the SALBP the Occupational Repetitive Action (OCRA). This well-known method gives ergonomic risk indicators for musculoskeletal disorders. A lexicographical approach to address the problem is proposed, where the minimum number of stations is obtained for SALBP and used as a starting point to solve a type-F ErgoSALBP (feasibility problem) focused on satisfying the maximum ergonomic risk workload. Once the exact solution is found, we establish an objective function to smooth the ergonomic risk distribution among stations. We tested a total of 2160 instances with up to 297 tasks. Our method was able to solve 94% of all instances optimally. The share of solutions found with only green stations (the ideal ergonomic condition) was 87%, surpassing the state of the art. For the instances where the model did not converge to a solution within the time limit, we present a procedure to assess the optimality gap. Furthermore, the model can be embedded as a building block for other assembly line configurations. Finally, the results provide trade-off insights for managers: the average OCRA for the line improves as the cycle time increases, which may positively impact workers’ satisfaction and product quality in the long run. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Though Industry 4.0 automation has replaced the human workforce by machines in industries, physical workers are indispensable in many facilities. One primary source of stress in the manufacturing workplace is inappropriate work content (e.g., unreasonable workload and work pace). With workers facing physical activities or machine operations, work-related stress can affect their performance and cause productivity, quality, and safety problems. Industrial managers constantly seek ways to ease stress among workforce, as Healthy Operator is proposed as an essential pillar of the Operator 4.0 concept. As the first step of stress reduction is to identify the stress (if possible, its early signs), heart rate variability (HRV) is widely measured, with different methods adopted to assess the stress levels of workers. Recent technological advancements have developed many non-invasive measurement techniques and systems, offering more convenience and flexibility than traditional clinical methods. Since human centricity is a strategic focus of the forthcoming Industry 5.0 initiative proposed by the European Union, these measurement practices should be disseminated and shared to foster better stress identification and reduction. A systematic literature review is needed to deliver a comprehensive update in the field. Besides synthesizing the relevant development, the review study aims to motivate industrial managers to adopt a similar approach and provide helpful guidance on what to expect with the Heart Rate Variability measurement for the workplace stress assessment. A detailed protocol for the systematic literature review is given.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Ergonomic risk assessment is required to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Some assessment techniques in a broad range of complexity have been suggested. A complex tool quantifies a detailed risk, but it is time-consuming. In this study, a simple risk assessment method is proposed to improve (Kaizen) production line work by lowering the physical load on the worker. This method is based on Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA), but it can be used not only for posture analysis, but also for consecutive repetition work in any production line. A station work unit is divided into work elements. Two posture scores per work element are estimated for the upperlimbs as well as for the head, trunk and legs, respectively. Physical workload on the work unit is obtained from the weighted average of workloads on consecutive work elements applying a tact time. The daily workload is also examined for the workload on work units and production planning. The validity of the proposed method is investigated by an assembly line of vending machines for case study.

AB  - The flow shop scheduling problem (FSP) is a classic shop scheduling problem with a strong engineering background. As an extension of FSP, the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) involves parallel machine scheduling, and the worker assignment problem on assembly lines (WAPAL) involves worker allocation. Parallel machine scheduling and multi-skilled and multilevel worker allocation are both involved in the actual assembly lines of complex products, but few studies have investigated them simultaneously. This work studies a complex product assembly line scheduling problem considering multi-skilled worker assignment and parallel team scheduling and takes the maximum completion time and the imbalance degree of team workload as the optimization objective. An integer programming model is proposed, and a hybrid coding method considers the worker assignment and task order. Three improved strategies based on a multiple objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) are proposed in the local search. Finally, 20 test instances are generated based on actual enterprise labor data, and the results based on the three strategies are compared with six MOEAs. The results show that the three strategies are superior in terms of the quality and distribution of solutions. The inverted generational distance (IGD) index value is increased by 49.97%, 47.89%, 47.08% respectively and the hypervolume (HV) index value is increased by 39.76%, 38.19%, 38.15% respectively. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - The competitiveness of modern manufacturing systems is based on a high production rate and a high level of flexibility. Despite the high level of automation achieved in production systems, flexibility is often provided by human dexterity and the cognitive capabilities of the workforce, as in assembly lines. In the case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In these contexts, a high production rate leads to high physical workload, and job rotation is adopted in order to reduce the ergonomic risk. Traditionally, ergonomics and human performance issues have been investigated separately. However, in the design and scheduling of human-based manufacturing systems, a reliable description of human components is required in order to jointly evaluate production system performance and assess workers risk of MSDs In this paper, the authors propose a model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is a mixed integer programming model allowing for the maximization of production rate jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the OCRA (OCcupational Repetitive Actions) method (ISO 11228-3:2007), widely recognized as an effective tool for the risk assessment of Upper Limb Work related MSDs (UL-WMSDs). Moreover, the different workers performance due to their respective training levels and skills is considered in the problem formulation. The model is applied to an industrial case study. Results show the models capacity to identify optimal job rotation schedules jointly achieving productivity and ergonomic risk goals. Performances of the solutions obtained improve as workforce flexibility increases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of methods for evaluating the environmental and physical loads on workers in manufacturing plants, considering their locations. Participants were employees of DENSO CORPORATION's manufacturing facilities, and environmental sensors (for temperature and humidity) and BLE beacons were installed to cover the work area. Questionnaires were completed by the participants twice to assess their thermal comfort and fatigue in the work environment. The results showed that a regression prediction model with an adjusted R-squared of 0.418 for fixed-point temperature and 0.495 for perceived temperature was developed for thermal comfort. No linear relationship was found between environmental factors and fatigue, and a decision tree analysis was conducted. Relative humidity and activity level, along with temperature, were selected as predictor variables. The findings suggest that it is possible to estimate the work environment and workload without adding additional measurement-related burdens or challenges. This highlights the usefulness of the proposed method, which takes into account the environmental distribution throughout the work area rather than relying solely on conventional fixed-point observation data, for assessing workers' exposure to the environment and preventing occupational accidents.Clinical Relevance-The proposed approach, combining indoor localization with environmental status, can estimate the condition of workers and is expected to be a good solution for preventing occupational accidents and enhancing workers' health. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper discusses the potential benefits of using augmented reality (AR) technology to enhance human–robot collaborative industrial processes. The authors describe a real-world use case at Siemens premises in which an AR-based authoring tool is used to reduce cognitive load, assist human workers in training robots, and support calibration and inspection tasks during assembly tasks. The study highlights the potential of AR as a solution for optimizing human–robot collaboration and improving productivity. The article describes the methodology used to deploy and evaluate the ARContent tool, which demonstrated improved usability, reduced task load, and increased efficiency in the assembly process. However, the study is limited by the restricted availability of workers and their knowledge of assembly tasks with robots. The authors suggest that future work should focus on testing the ARContent tool with a larger user pool and improving the authoring tool based on the shortcomings identified during the study. Overall, this work shows the potential for AR technology to revolutionize industrial processes and improve collaboration between humans and robots. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The advent of new technologies and their implementation in manufacturing is accelerating the progress of Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Among the enabling technologies of I4.0, collaborative robots (cobots) push factory reconfiguration and prompt for worker empowerment by exploiting the respective assets of both humans and robots. Indeed, human has superior dexterity, flexibility, problem-solving ability. Robot excels in strength, endurance, accuracy and is expendable for risky activities. Therefore, task assignment problem in a production line with coexisting humans and robots cannot limit to the workload balancing among workers but should make the most of everyone respective abilities. The outcomes should not be only an increased productivity, but also improved production quality, human safety and well-being. Task assignment strategy should rely on a comprehensive assessment of the tasks from the viewpoint of suitability to humans or robots. As there are several conflicting evaluation criteria, often qualitative, the study defines the set of criteria, their metrics and proposes a method for task classification relying on Fuzzy Inference System to map each task onto a set of collaboration classes. The outcome of the study is the formal description of a set of evaluation criteria with their metrics. Another outcome is a Fuzzy Classification procedure that support production managers to properly consider all the criteria in the assignment of the tasks. The proposed methodology was tested on a case study derived from a manual manufacturing process to demonstrate its application during the process planning. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - For improved prevention of health issues among blue-collar workers, there is a need for an overview of the physical activity at work and leisure using technical long-term measurements in blue-collar sectors investigation of differences between the sectors. Thus, the objective of this paper was to provide an overview and investigate differences in physical activities and body postures at work and leisure among blue-collar sectors. The Dphacto cohort consists of 1087 workers from manufacturing, transportation and cleaning sectors (901 blue-collar and 186 white-collar workers) in Denmark. Eligible workers provided physical activity and heart rate measurements over several days with follow-up on health-related outcomes by self-report and registers. Considerable differences in sitting, standing, time on feet (walking, shuffling and standing combined) and forward bending of the back were found between work and leisure, and between the sectors. This overview of physical activity at work and leisure can be useful for better prevention of work-related health issues among blue-collar workers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper studies the effect of absenteeism in production line. The analysis shows that the number of absentees at production line increases the workload to the available worker and gives effect to the production. Thus, it gives a major potential for generating bottlenecks. To mitigate this problem and ensure that the workload of workers is at optimum level, an appropriate number of production plans need to be investigated. This paper demonstrates the integration of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and System Dynamics (SD) in simulating the effect of absenteeism in production flow at an aircraft composite manufacturing factory. Based on the preliminary result, the effect of the absenteeism is found to influence the amount of throughput, waiting and cycle time. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - To enable Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) level garment manufacturers to measure and monitor the work of individual workers without incurring a large financial burden, a smart sewing work measurement system was developed using an IoT-based power monitoring device and an approximation algorithm. The amount of electric current used in the sewing work was measured, and the measured data was transmitted to a server using Wi-Fi communication. The analysis of the data was conducted through the Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods. The daily workload of each worker derived from the system developed through this study showed an error rate of 8% compared to the actual workload, and the time measured by the sensor was different from the time measured by a manager using a stopwatch. These differences are considered to be due to measurement errors in the stopwatch, human noise from the measurer and the operator, and the relatively few samples relative to the total workload. The IoT-based power monitoring and work measurement system for sewing work developed through this study can be applied to smart garment manufacturing factories at an acceptable cost level, while SMEs can realise high recognition rates and semi-real-time monitoring. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the Industry 4.0 vision, the orchestration of software components plays a crucial role in enabling the continuous reconfiguration, programming, and evolution of the factory floor elements. The objective of an Industry 4.0 software orchestration system is to manage the software elements controlling one or more industrial processes with the purpose of enforcing specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for each connected use case (e.g., cooperative robots and connected workers). The orchestration systems currently available are not equipped to guarantee programmable industrial SLA, making it difficult to meet carrier grade reliability and reduced time to repair required by Operational Technology (OT). This article investigates research directions and use cases to manage programmable SLAs with four criticality levels in order to enable the use of orchestration in industrial scenarios. The main contribution is an approach, differentiated by workload criticality level, that uses proactive and reactive orchestration actions to meet industrial functional and non-functional requirements, and to mitigate SLA violations. The approach is exemplified through Industry 4.0 use-case scenarios.  © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Current construction safety practices heavily rely on the use of multiple safety signs to mitigate potential risks. This study investigates the cognitive load imposed on construction workers by various design characteristics of safety signs, including text-only, pictogram with text, and pictogram-only signs. A comprehensive cognitive assessment of 513 construction workers was conducted to measure recall rates and visual attention. The results revealed that text-only signs led to lower cognitive load compared with pictogram-based signs, with no significant split-attention effect observed when text and pictograms were combined. The average recall rate across all sign types was 3.32 items, with over 95% of participants recalling six or fewer items. Additionally, recall rates for pictogram-based signs decreased significantly when more than nine items were displayed. Visual attention analysis indicated that while color had no significant impact, the order of placement did. These findings highlight the importance of limiting the number of safety signs and carefully designing them to optimize recall and reduce cognitive load. Future research should explore additional factors such as sex, complexity of work, and environmental conditions to develop a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive load in construction settings. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - It is important for construction companies to sustain a productive workforce without sacrificing its health and safety. This study aims to develop a practical judgement method to estimate the workload risk of individual construction workers. Based on studies, we developed a workload model comprising a hygrothermal environment, behavioral information, and the physical characteristics of workers). The construction workers’ heart rate and physical activity were measured using the data collected from a wearable device equipped with a biosensor and an acceleration sensor. This study is the first report to use worker physical activity, age, and the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) to determine a worker’s physical workload. The accuracy of this health risk judgment result was 89.2%, indicating that it is possible to easily judge the health risk of workers even in an environment where it is difficult to measure the subject in advance. The proposed model and its findings can aid in monitoring the health impacts of working conditions during construction activities, and thereby contribute toward determining workers’ health damage. However, the sampled construction workers are 12 workers, further studies in other working conditions are required to accumulate more evidence and assure the accuracy of the models. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Robotic teleoperation is used in various applications, including the nuclear industry, where the experience and intelligence of a human operator are necessary for making complex decisions that are beyond the autonomy of robots. Human-robot interfaces that help strengthen an operators situational awareness without inducing excessive cognitive load are crucial to the success of teleoperation. This paper presents a novel visual interface that allows operators to simultaneously control a 6-DoF camera platform and a robotic manipulator whilst experiencing the remote environment through a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD). The proposed system, Orbital Head-Mounted Display (OHMD), utilizes head rotation tracking to command camera movement in azimuth and elevation directions around a fixation point located at a robot's end-effector. A human factor study was conducted to compare the interface acceptance, perceived workload, and task performance of OHMD with a conventional interface utilizing multiple fixed cameras (Array) and a standard head-mounted display implementation (HMD). Results show that both the OHMD and HMD interfaces significantly improve task performance, reduce perceived workload and increase interface acceptance compared to the Array interface. Participants reported they preferred OHMD due to the increased assistance and freedom in viewpoint selection. Whilst OHMD excelled in usefulness, the standard HMD interface allowed operators to perform robotic welding tasks significantly faster. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The assembly of large and complex products as cars typically involves a huge amount of production resources as workers, pieces of equipment and layout areas. Multi-manned workstations commonly characterize these assembly lines along with some additional features such as compatibility/incompatibility between the different mounting positions, equipment sharing and worker cooperation. The simultaneous management of all such aspects significantly increases the balancing problem complexity. This paper proposes a new mixed integer programming model for such multi-manned assembly line synchronization problem to simultaneously optimize the line efficiency, the line length and the workload smoothness. A customized procedure based on a simulated annealing algorithm is developed to effectively solve this problem. The aforementioned procedure is validated through an industrial case study of an Italian sports car manufacturer distinguished by 665 tasks and numerous synchronization constraints typical of real assembly lines. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although assembly line balancing problem has been an attractive field of research in many industries over the past decades, few researches focused on the problems in shipbuilding. In this contribution, we deal with a more realistic assembly line for sub-block in shipbuilding, through which lots of small different products were produced. Thus, the problem becomes more complex, which can be regarded as a variant of the classical assembly line balancing problem, batch-model assembly line balancing problem with space and sequence constraints. Our goal is to find the optimal division of the total assignment into different production batches based on the balance of the station workloads and higher efficiencies of the workers and equipments. We solve the said problem with a memetic algorithm, which is illustrated in detail. The validity of the proposed algorithms is tested using the real data of the sub-block assembly in shipbuilding, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms highly the existing standard genetic algorithm in terms of ability to find the optimal solutions. © IMechE 2014.

AB  - Meeting the delivery commitments is important for the success of any business. On the other hand, balancing other resources is also essential for business sustainability. This work provides a conceptual framework to make an optimization model to optimize the on-time delivery (OTD) for an Assemble-to-order (ATO) Production System. OTD optimization model is given by considering the delivery penalty, overtime working, manpower cost, and production item set-up time. The proposed model is helpful while making the daily production plan and work schedule of a multi-model assembly line. Furthermore, the optimization model is a integration of prediction and assembly line optimization models. Learning-based techniques are adopted to make the prediction model. Assembly line worker assignment and workload balancing algorithms are adopted to optimize the workforce or manpower cost. A use case illustration is given to understand the research scope better. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Two-Sided Assembly Line Balancing (2S-ALB) is essential to the production of large-sized high-volume products, including automotive production, at assembly plants. The 2S-ALB problem involves different assembly resources such as worker skills, tools, and machines required for the assembly. This research modeled and optimized the 2S-ALB with resource constraints. In the end, besides favorable workload balance, the number of resources can be optimized. For optimization purpose, particle swarm optimization was modified to reduce dependence on a single best solution. This was conducted by replacing the best solution with the top three solutions in the reproduction process. Computational experiment results using 12 benchmark test problems indicated that the 2S-ALB with a resource-constrained model was able to reduce the number of resources for use in an assembly line. Furthermore, the proposed Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) was capable of searching for minimum solutions to 11 out of 12 test problems. The good performance of MPSO was attributed to its ability to maintain particle diversity over iterations. The proposed 2S-ALB model and MPSO algorithm were validated later using an industrial case study. This research makes a two-fold contribution: (a) Proposition of a novel 2S-ALB with resource-constrained model and (b) a modified PSO algorithm with enhanced performance.  © 2022 Sharif University of Technology.

AB  - Inconsistent published findings regarding a proposed buffering role of self-efficacy in stress coping led us to develop a model in which within-person variability in self-efficacy over time affects how individuals' mean levels of self-efficacy moderate the relationship between demands and psychological symptoms. Results from two independent samples (manufacturing workers and college students) supported the hypothesized interaction between demands, self-efficacy mean level, and self-efficacy variability. Demands were more positively associated with psychological strain among those with high and stable self-efficacy than those with high and variable self-efficacy. We discuss the implications of intrapersonal variability in self-efficacy for research on stress coping. © 2015 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The classical distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP) mainly considers factory allocation, machine arrangement, job sequencing and transportation. To date, the relevant literature has not studied the DFJSPs with worker arrangement, which widely exists in practical manufacturing systems. In this paper, we investigate the DFJSP with worker arrangement (DFJSPW), where not only the factories, machines and operations, but the workers are considered simultaneously. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated for this problem. Correspondingly, an improved memetic algorithm (IMA) based on the structure of NSGA-II is proposed for the proposed DFJSPW whose objective is to minimize the makespan, maximum workload of machines and workload of workers simultaneously. In IMA, a simplified two-level encoding and four heuristic decoding methods are designed to encode and decode the individuals. A well-designed adaptive neighborhood search operator is developed to enhance the local search ability of IMA and speed its convergence. Fifty-eight benchmarks are constructed to evaluate the performance of our proposed IMA. Extensive experiments show that in most examples, IMA performs better than four well-known multi-objective algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of IMA in solving the DFJSPW. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The new Industry 5.0 paradigm complements the well-known Industry 4.0 approach by specifically driving research and innovation to facilitate the transition to sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In the manufacturing context, workers' diversity in terms of experience, productivity and physical capacity represents a significant challenge for companies, especially those characterized by high staff turnover and manual processes with high workload and poor ergonomics. In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human-centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limitations, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's implementation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom. The primary goal of our model is to find the most appropriate assignment of job and individual-flexible rest-break plan for each worker. The authors test the model application in an industrial setting. Useful managerial insights emerge and prescriptive recommendations are provided. © 2022

AB  - The responsibilities of occupational health and safety workers are very hard to ensure other workers is safety. The responsibility make the workers of occupational health and safety has some affecting to their job. Some effect can cause over the mental workload. This research aims to determine the score of mental workload from three professions in occupational health and safety, i.e. safetyman contractor, safetyman field and safetyman officer. Six indicators in the NASA-TLX method, i.e. mental demand (MD), physical demand (PD), temporal demand (TD), performance (OP), effort (EF) and frustration level (FR) are used to determine the worker's mental workload. The result shows mental demand (MD) is the most dominant indicators affecting the mental workload between safetyman contractor, safetyman field and safety officer. The highest mental workload score among safety workers is on the safetyman field with WWL score at 62,38, because among the three types safety workers, the highest MD is on the safetyman field due to the responsibility. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

AB  - Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are one of the major cause of injuries and absenteeism at work. These lead to important cost in the manufacturing industry. Human-robot collaboration can help decreasing this issue by appropriately distributing the tasks and decreasing the workload of the factory worker. This paper proposes a novel generic task allocation approach based on hierarchical finite-state machines for human-robot assembly tasks. The developed framework decomposes first the main task into sub-tasks modelled as state machines. Based on capabilities considerations, workload, and performance estimations, the task allocator assigns the sub-task to human or robot agent. The algorithm was validated on the assembly of a crusher unit of a smoothie machine using the collaborative Franka Emika Panda robot and showed promising results in terms of productivity thanks to task parallelization, with improvement of more than 30% of the total assembly time with respect to a collaborative scenario, where the agents perform the tasks sequentially. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This study explores the potential synergy between neurodiversity and advanced technology within Industry 5.0, focusing on the integration of neurodiverse individuals in the workforce through Human-Machine Collaboration and Reciprocal Learning (RL). A cognitive load (CL) assessment procedure is developed using fuzzy logic inference across the dimensions of attention, memory, language, math, logic, and reading. A case study evaluates the effectiveness of RL in assisting assembly tasks. Different error-handling scenarios are compared. Experimental results show how RL can reduce the CL while improving assembly tasks efficiency, underscoring the value of intelligent systems in inclusive manufacturing, enhancing productivity and facilitating the integration of neurodiverse workers. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the multi-skilled workers assignment problem in complex assembly systems such as aircraft assembly lines. An adaptive binary particle swarm optimization (A-BPSO) algorithm is proposed, which is used to balance the workload of both assembly stations and processes and to minimize the human cost. Design/methodology/approach-Firstly, a cycle time model considering the cooperation of multi-skilled workers is constructed. This model provides a quantitative description of the relationship between the cycle time and multi-skilled workers by means of revising the standard learning curve with the "Partition-And-Accumulate" method. Then, to improve the accuracy and stability of the current heuristic algorithms, an A-BPSO algorithm that suits for the discrete optimization problems is proposed to assign multi-skilled workers to assembly stations and processes based on modified sigmoid limiting function. Findings-The proposed method has been successfully applied to a practical case, and the result justifies its advantage as well as adaptability to both theory and engineering application. Originality/value-A novel cycle time model considering cooperation of multi-skilled workers is constructed so that the calculation results of cycle time are more accurate and closer to reality. An A-BPSO algorithm is proposed to improve the stability and convergence in dealing with the problems with higher dimensional search space. This research can be used by the project managers and dispatchers on assembly field. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Industry 5.0 paradigm has renewed interest in the human sphere, emphasizing the importance of workers’ well-being in manufacturing activities. In such context, collaborative robotics originated as a technology to support humans in tiring and repetitive tasks. This study investigates the effects of assembly complexity in Human-Robot collaboration using physiological indicators of cognitive effort. In a series of experiments, participants performed assembly processes of different products with varying complexity, in two modalities: manually and with cobot assistance. Physiological measures, including skin conductance, heart rate variability and eye-tracking metrics were collected. The analysis of physiological signals showed trends suggesting the impact of assembly complexity and cobot support. One key finding of the study is that a single physiological signal usually may not provide a complete understanding of cognitive load. Therefore, a holistic approach should be followed. This approach highlighted the importance of considering multiple measures simultaneously to accurately assess workers’ well-being in industrial environments. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the antecedents of organizational commitment and turnover intentions among apparel manufacturing workers, specifically focusing on the moderating effects of creative behavior and instrumental readiness. Employing the Expectancy– Confirmation Theory, this study conveniently sampled 393 apparel workers from four free zone exporting firms to gather data. The collected data was analyzed using regression in STATA 14. The study revealed that, although workers were not overburdened with workload, factors such as skills obsolescence, entrepreneurship intention, fairness and rewards had predictive effects on their organizational commitment and turnover intentions. Additionally, the study found that creative behavior and instrumental readiness moderated the relationship between entrepreneurship intention and turnover intention. Given the recent adverse impact of inflation on the economic value of workers' wages and the uncertainty stemming from operational changes regarding skills obsolescence, the study provides valuable insights into how these factors may influence workers’ organizational commitment and turnover intentions. The study contributes important insights into contextualizing and examining turnover and organizational commitment within the apparel manufacturing industry using the hypothesized model developed in the context of the Expectancy-Confirmation Theory. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This research proposes an approach for evaluating human-centered work processes by combining Value Stream Mapping and ergonomic assessment of physical workload. Value Stream Mapping is a method used to create a visual representation of the flow of materials and information required to deliver a product, and aids in identifying potential bottlenecks and other constraints. However, it does not consider the effect of physical ergonomics on process execution and planning. To bridge this gap, the Ergonomic Assessment Worksheet screening tool is used to gain insight into unfavourable physical workload situations. The proposed approach follows five main steps: (i) scope definition, (ii) Value Stream Map, (iii) time study, (iv) ergonomic assessment, (v) combined analysis. A case study is conducted at a bicycle manufacturer to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in quantifying the impact of physical ergonomics on process performance. The method enables a systematic analysis of process chains to identify critical steps from both lean and ergonomic perspectives, emphasizing the importance of worker's physical well-being and the ability of ergonomic assessment methods to enhance Value Stream Maps. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The industrial sector is based on several pillars to reach success and achieve its mission and vision, which are mainly the resulted productivity and the human worker. Accordingly, this research aimed to work on solving production problems in one of the garment factories in Jordan by reducing the gap between actual and target production quantity and Improve ergonomics at the same time by reducing the risk levels that exposed to workers. The methodology used in this research is path process chart technique which is a motion and time study (MTS) method that is an advances combination from the process and pathway chart to represent the path that followed by the worker during doing the processes of work to establish the best path based in MTS principles to improve ergonomics side. The study analyzes all processes needed to produce a T-shirt product from two assembly lines. As a result, the production quantity increased from 668 pc to 828 pc to each hour and the efficiency increased from 74.64% to 92.5% and levels of risk have decreased as shown at RULA and REBA assessment tools. It is recommended to use path process chart to analyze the work then eliminate the non-added value motions and reduce risk levels. Also, it is recommended to convert layout from S-shape flow pattern to U-shape flow pattern and redistribute workers to balance workload. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background Workers laboring in steel industries in tropical settings with high ambient temperatures are subjected to thermally stressful environments that can create well-known risks of heat-related illnesses and limit workers’ productivity. Methods A cross-sectional study undertaken in a steel industry in a city nicknamed “Steel City” in Southern India assessed thermal stress by wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and level of dehydration from urine color and urine specific gravity. A structured questionnaire captured self-reported heat-related health symptoms of workers. Results Some 90% WBGT measurements were higher than recommended threshold limit values (27.2–41.7°C) for heavy and moderate workloads and radiational heat from processes were very high in blooming-mill/coke-oven (67.6°C globe temperature). Widespread heat-related health concerns were prevalent among workers, including excessive sweating, fatigue, and tiredness reported by 50% workers. Productivity loss was significantly reported high in workers with direct heat exposures compared to those with indirect heat exposures (χ2 = 26.1258, degrees of freedom = 1, p < 0.001). Change in urine color was 7.4 times higher among workers exposed to WBGTs above threshold limit values (TLVs). Conclusion Preliminary evidence shows that high heat exposures and heavy workload adversely affect the workers’ health and reduce their work capacities. Health and productivity risks in developing tropical country work settings can be further aggravated by the predicted temperature rise due to climate change, without appropriate interventions. Apart from industries enhancing welfare facilities and designing control interventions, further physiological studies with a seasonal approach and interventional studies are needed to strengthen evidence for developing comprehensive policies to protect workers employed in high heat industries. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Human factors play a relevant role in the dynamic work environments of the manufacturing sector in terms of production efficiency, safety, and sustainable performance. This is particularly relevant in assembly lines where humans are widely employed alongside automated and robotic agents. In this situation, operators’ ability to adapt to different levels of task complexity and variability in each workstation has a strong impact on the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the overall production process. This paper presents an application of a theoretical and empirical method used to assess the matching of different workers to various workstations based on a quantified comparison between the workload associated with the tasks and the human capability of the workers that can rotate among them. The approach allowed for the development of an algorithm designed to operationalise indicators for workload and task complexity requirements, considering the skills and capabilities of individual operators. This led to the creation of human performance (HP) indices. The HP indices were utilized to ensure a good match between requirements and capabilities, aiming to minimise the probability of human error and injuries. The developed and customised model demonstrated encouraging results in the specific case studies where it was applied but also offers a generalizable approach that can extend to other contexts and situations where job rotations can benefit from effectively matching operators to suitable task requirements. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Efficiency improvement in manufacturing company is essential to ensure the cycle of continuous improvement. Prior decision was reducing 6 operators in the cold press team work into 5 workers. Thus significant changes, of course, would resulted in the change of the workload experienced by each operator. The research objective in this study is validating from the productivity of the reduction conducted by measuring the workload with combining Full Time Equivalent (FTE) and Cardiovascular Load Percentage (%CVL). The result states that there are differences in measurement results workload from both methods. Based on the FTE method, all Cold Press operator's workload has an index in average of 1.4128 with all was above 1.28 indicating the "Overload" condition. On the other hand, based on the physical workload method obtained that % CVL in average was 8.272% with all operator was below 30% which indicates the workload of all Cold Press operators were in a not experiencing fatigue category.

AB  - The concept of Industry 5.0 is set to revolutionize the landscape of modern manufacturing, emphasizing human-centricity and elevating the well-being of industry workers as a central tenet of the production process. This paper extends this vision by integrating the dimension of health, focusing not only on the well-being of the operator but also on the detection of their health condition, predicting potential issues, and consequently enhancing their overall welfare. Building upon this enhanced perspective, our work explores the role of Operator Digital Twins (ODTs), which are instrumental in creating a symbiotic relationship between human operators and industrial machinery. ODTs act as digital counterparts, reflecting the physical and cognitive states of operators, thus facilitating real-time monitoring of their capabilities, workload, stress levels, and various health-related parameters. The paper delves into the motivations driving the development of ODTs, abstractly models their functions, and outlines the architectural blueprint. We present an initial ODT prototype with wearable technology and simulated data together with a discussion of the experimental insights and outcomes. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The correct interaction between the workforce and augmented, virtual, and mixed reality technologies represents a crucial aspect of the success of the smart factory. This interaction is, indeed, affected by the variability of human behavior and its reliability, which can strongly influence the quality, safety, and productivity standards. For this reason, this paper aims to provide a clear and complete analysis of the impacts of these technologies on the worker’s performance. Design/methodology/approach: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed papers that focused on the implementation of augmented and virtual technologies in manufacturing systems and their effects on human performance. Findings: In total, 61 papers were selected and thoroughly analyzed. The findings of this study reveal that augmented, virtual and mixed reality can be applied for several applications in manufacturing systems with different types of devices, that involve various advantages and disadvantages. The worker’s performances that are influenced by the use of these technologies are above all time to complete a task, error rate, and mental and physical workload. Originality/value: Over the years augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies in manufacturing systems have been investigated by researchers. Several studies mostly focused on technological issues, have been conducted. The role of the operator, whose tasks may be influenced positively or negatively by the use of new devices, has been hardly ever analyzed and a deep analysis of human performance affected by these technologies is missing. This study represents a preliminary analysis to fill this gap. The results obtained from the SLR allowed us to develop a conceptual framework that investigates the current state-of-the-art knowledge about the topic and highlights gaps in the current research. © 2022, OmniaScience.

AB  - In the design of lean manufacturing systems, U-shaped manufacturing cells, also known as U-lines, have been used to address product variety, reduce worker travel distances between stations, and improve productivity levels. However, U-line machine assignments to multiple workers which balance workload are an important aspect of the manufacturing system design. Changes in product demand imply changes to the production plan that would require a rebalancing effort on multiple U-lines. In this paper, a heuristic U-line assignment algorithm has been developed to provide feasible U-line machine/operator assignments. The proposed heuristic can be used to quickly evaluate these different U-line assignment options, and balance workload between multiple cell workers to meet takt time requirements. Different U-line system operating parameters can be specified and used to assign workers to workstations. These include travel time between all possible workstations; setup, processing and inspection time at each workstation; and cells load/unload times at the input/output cell interface. The basic problem is np-hard, and increases dramatically in size as a function of the number of workstations, the number of workers and takt time goals change. The developed heuristic reaches a good feasible solution for all sized problems in a short amount of computation time.

AB  - Ergonomics continues to be relevant in work-places in which a significant amount of manual labor exists, such as in some of the Cellular manufacturing Systems (CMS). In order to distribute the workload evenly over all the workers in the line, some of the industries resorted to the practice of rotating all the workers through all workstations in the cell (Nagare cell) that prevents monotony and boredom. The presence of automated equipment in the cell will hamper this strategy for job rotation. This study aims to demonstrate the application of ergonomically designed looping layout in the assembly cell in the labor demanded lean manufacturing environment. The study was conducted in a process line in an automobile ancillary unit. The current process line which was conventional U-shaped line was simulated and the productivity has been verified and validated with the real life environment. Process map showed that the operators walked long distances, felt stress in certain workstations and that inventory piled up at the bottleneck workstation. We identify sub-cells within the cell. With the same manpower, we develop a new layout (Suzhal) and make workers rotate within each sub-cell. The proposed layout was simulated and results have been compared with the current layout. The analysis shows a reduction in the total operating cycle time, higher alertness among operators, better distribution of workloads in the group and hence higher productivity. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - This paper aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of the affordances of Augmented Reality (AR) as a workplace-based learning and training technology in supporting manual or semi-automated manufacturing tasks that involve both complex manipulation and reasoning. Between-subject laboratory experiments involving 20 participants are conducted on a real-life electro-mechanical assembly task to investigate the impacts of various modes of information delivery through AR compared to traditional training methods on task efficiency, number of errors, learning, independence, and cognitive load. The AR application is developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed. Several insights drawn from the experiments and expert interviews are discussed to inform the design of future AR technologies for both training and assisting incumbent and future manufacturing workers on complex manipulation and reasoning tasks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Owing to the growing number of elderly workers in developed countries, the age-friendly design of production systems is crucial for the success of human-centric manufacturing. To obtain knowledge for designing age-friendly production systems, this study conducted the first characteristic analysis of elderly workers, focusing on the set parts supply process. By combining motion analysis with the subjective mental workload survey, this study clarified the differences in how tasks are performed by elderly and young workers and how such differences affect the mental workload of elderly workers. The findings enable evidence-based design and implementation of age-friendly production systems. © 2023 CIRP

AB  - Within the paradigm of Industry 4.0, digital reconfigurable manufacturing and assembly systems can rapidly adapt to dynamic market demand, modifying their capacity and functionality. In manual or hybrid reconfigurable assembly systems, the rapid and frequent variations in the performed tasks subject workers to a significant cognitive load, making relevant the learning-forgetting phenomenon. In fact, the operators carry out the assigned activities for a short time before a reconfiguration of the system takes place, assigning them tasks often different from those just performed. This paper aims at investigating how the tasks’ execution time varies for operators working along a reconfigurable assembly line, depending on the learning forgetting effect. We applied a Kottas-Lau algorithm, considering the expected execution times updated according to a learning-forgetting curve. A numerical example, considering with five successive reconfigurations, allows to analyse the expected execution time trend for each operator-task pair and the variation in costs obtained as the operators learning rate and the variability of the operations change.

AB  - Understanding how skilled workers interact with assistance systems in manufacturing and how they experience the factory environment is fundamental to modeling human interaction and optimizing the processes correctly. This paper investigates humans’ behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners’ evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multi-criteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human–machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - To achieve sustainable manufacturing of large-scale end-of-life products, disassembly for recycling and remanufacturing has been widely adopted by industries. Disassembly line balancing becomes an important and challenging issue. The disassembly efficiencies of workers are different in the actual disassembly line due to some factors, including disassembly environment, skill level, work enthusiasm, etc. However, efficiency differences are often ignored in previous studies, which ultimately lead to unbalanced workloads among stations. Therefore, this article establishes a disassembly line balancing model that considers workers with different efficiencies and introduces the bucket brigade model into the disassembly line. Its optimization objectives include workload smoothness, cost of workers, disassembly risk, and disassembly demand. To obtain high-quality solutions, a discrete flower pollination algorithm based on problem characteristics is proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing it with 11 algorithms. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to an actual television disassembly case considering workers with different efficiencies, and provide decision makers with multiple disassembly schemes.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Cross-trained worker assignment has become increasingly important for manufacturing efficiency and flexibility in cellular manufacturing system because of the recent increase in labor cost. Researchers mainly focused on assigning skilled workers to tasks for favorable capacity or cost. However, few of them have recognized the need for skill level enhancement through cross-training to avoid excessive training, especially for workload balance across multiple cells. This study presents a new mathematical programming model aimed at minimum training and maximum workload balance with economical labor utilization, to address the worker assignment problem with a cross-training plan spanning multiple cells. The model considers the trade-off between training expenditure and workload balance to achieve a more flexible solution based on decision-maker's preference. Considering the computational complexity of the problem, the classical swarm intelligence optimizers, i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC), are implemented to search the problem landscape. To improve the optimization performance, a superior tracking ABC with an augmented information sharing strategy is designed to address the problem. Ten benchmark problems are employed for numerical experiments. The results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed models as well as the developed algorithms. © 2018 Lang Wu et al.

AB  - The supply of parts to the workstations of assembly lines is a critical design and operational issue. Even though automation and collaborative robots are increasingly used in industry, human operators are frequently employed in the picking and assembly of manual parts. These are time-consuming activities required to be efficiently performed at a high rate and for prolonged periods. Therefore, ergonomic analysis is necessary to reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal injuries due to the biomechanical loads. The proper layout of shelves storing part containers along the production line, and the location of the containers on the shelves, may improve picking efficiency and reduce biomechanical risk. Several manufacturing companies use computer-aided ergonomic tools to improve the design of manual production lines, racking, shelving, and workstations. This paper describes the development of a support tool to configure industrial light shelves for feeding the assembly lines. The approach includes the development of a knowledge base to support the geometrical configuration of the shelving and an ergonomic analysis based on the RULA method, considering the shelf’s position and the operator’s postures. As a test case, the model has been used to evaluate the ergonomic score of some configured shelving based on a prescribed picking sequence. The results show that the proposed approach can help in comparing the ergonomic score of candidate shelving layouts to improve the design of parts storage systems to reduce operators’ workload and ergonomic risk. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) technologies promise to increase the flexibility and productivity of the workforce by providing real-time information to workers right where it is needed. Following Cognitive Load Theory and Attention Theory, AR assistance can reduce the burden on workers’ mental capacity while performing a task, thereby improving task performance. The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Occupational accidents and casualties in the construction industry are ranked first among all industries. Construction workers are urged to avoid increasing workload and fatigue due to work environment factors in the jobsite with specific hazards of high risk. The present study adopts the photoplethysmography (PPG) monitoring technology of the wearable wristband for monitoring the heart rate (HR). The study establishes the heart rate schema of the workers, evaluate their workload levels, and verify the physiological impact of working at elevated jobsite on the workload through a statistical T-test. In this study, the T-test in pairs reaches the results of 15-minute time interval unit is the most suitable data analysis interval. The worker working in an elevated environment increases heart rate due to the afraid of height and relatively reduce the worker’s ability to adapt to tasks with high physical demands. It is estimated that more than 10% of working time increased from moderate to heavy workload. © 2024 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.

AB  - The price war is commercial competition characterized by the repeated cutting of prices below those of competitors. The sugar industry is the country's most important business in Thailand that is facing a price wars competition in the global market. Sugar manufacturers have to eliminate and reduce the cost that occurs from non-value-added activities from processes to compete with the producer from other countries. Then, lean manufacturing (LM) is used to be a systematic approach for the identification and elimination of wastes (non-value-added activities) from processes. It can apply to all types of business organizations to enhance productivity and minimize cost. This study aims to apply lean manufacturing for analyzing, improving and eliminating unnecessary activities through value stream mapping (VSM) in warehouse management of sugar manufacturing company in Thailand. All activities are broken down into smaller activities to can be analyzed via workload analysis. ECRS principle is used to make up new activities after identifying the waste and the optimal workflows. The results illustrated that one operation process was removed, the number of workers was decreased by 3 persons, the cycle time of warehouse management decreased by 36% and the total workload of workers decreased by 48%. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In future manufacturing human-machine interaction will evolve towards flexible and smart collaboration. It will meet requirements from the optimization of assembly processes as well as from motivated and skilled human behavior. Recently, human factors engineering has substantially progressed by means of detailed task analysis. However, there is still a lack in precise measuring cognitive and sensorimotor patterns for the analysis of long-term mental and physical strain. This work presents a novel methodology that enables real-time measurement of cognitive load based on executive function analyses as well as biomechanical strain from non-obtrusive wearable sensors. The methodology works on 3D information recovery of the working cell using a precise stereo measurement device. The worker is equipped with eye tracking glasses and a set of wearable accelerometers. Wireless connectivity transmits the sensor-based data to a nearby PC for monitoring. Data analytics then recovers the 3D geometry of gaze and viewing frustum within the working cell and furthermore extracts the worker's task switching rate as well as a skeleton-based approximation of worker's posture associated with an estimation of biomechanical strain of muscles and joints. First results enhanced by AI-based estimators demonstrate a good match with the results of an activity analysis performed by occupational therapists.  © 2021, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

AB  - The construction industry has been suffering from both low labor productivity growth and safety issues, due to the increasing project site complexities and the lack of skilled labors. As a potential technical solution, Augmented Reality (AR) has been studied to reduce the cognitive workloads in construction job sites by visualizing task-related information in the direct context of the workspace and operations. Instead of using helmets/goggles that may decrease users’ field of views, we advocate mobile projectors for AR (MPAR), and propose a camera-projector system to ensure consistent AR projection even if the projectors may change poses when installed on mobile platforms such as human workers or even construction collaborative robots (co-robot). By obtaining the projector’s pose relative to the projection plane (e.g., a wall or panel on construction site) via composing a series of homography transformations in this system, we could determine how to warp virtual information (images or 3D models) for desired projections, no matter whether human observers’ head poses are needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using two construction AR applications: displaying occluded as-planned or as-built facility information behind a mock-up wall. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

AB  - Manual material handling and occupational tasks demanding physical push-pull activities are very common in various industrial settings regardless of automation. These activities may become the cause of fatigue, accidents and/or different occupational hazards if not properly focused to balance workload as per physical strength and stamina of the worker. This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the isometric pull strength of apparel cart/trolley pullers and muscular activity of upper limbs. Jackson strength evaluation system was used to measure isometric pull strengths while IXTA Data Acquisition System to measure and analyze the muscle activity. The experiments were conducted with twenty work-in-process (WIP) manual material handlers of an apparel manufacturing industry. Electromyographical (EMG) data of muscle activity was collected by placing electrodes on pronator teres, brachial biceps, pectoralis major and lower trapezius muscles during the pull tasks. The results show that torso pull in seated posture has the maximum isometric average value of 62.20 ± 5.91 kg while arm lift has the minimum strength value of 37.10 ± 4.61 kg. Assessment of muscle fatigue caused by pulling force is important in determining job severity of workers and mitigating occupational injuries which help in balancing workloads for effective management. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Nowadays, in the context of Industry 4.0, advanced working environments aim at achieving a high degree of human-machine collaboration. This phenomenon occurs, on the one hand, through the correct interpretation of operators' data by machines that can adapt their functioning to support workers, and on the other hand, by ensuring the transparency of the actions of the system itself. This study used an ad hoc system that allowed the co-registration of a set of participants' implicit and explicit (I/E) data in two experimental conditions that varied in the level of mental workload (MWL). Findings showed that the majority of the considered I/E measures were able to discriminate the different task-related mental demands and some implicit measures were capable of predicting task performance in both tasks. Moreover, self-reported measures showed that participants were aware of such differences in MWL. Finally, the paradigm's ecology highlights that task and environmental features may affect the reliability of the various I/E measures. Thus, these factors have to be considered in the design and development of advanced adaptive systems within the industrial context. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The new industry 4.0 paradigm provides for totally automated and interconnected industrial production processes that require greater human-machine interaction. This involves the onset of new problems related to the stress evaluation of the aged worker which is found to operate in new and more complex work contexts. In literature several works for human stress detection are presented, they use above supervised machine learning with high accuracy level detection, but needed a complicated training phase. Moreover, a relevant issue in the field of stress detection lies in the model validation, indeed the commonly questionnaires used to record perceived stress levels are prone to subjective inaccuracies. To reduce this limitation, in this paper an unsupervised machine learning based stress detection system, in which the labels from perceived stress levels are not needed, is presented. It analyses heart rate, galvanic skin response and electrooculogram signals, relevant for the detection of excessive stress and cognitive load. The developed architecture software has been experimented in laboratory contest and preliminary obtained results appear promising. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The assembly of large and complex products such as cars, trucks, and white goods typi-cally involves a huge amount of production resources such as workers, pieces of equipment, and layout areas. In this context, multi‐manned workstations commonly characterize these assembly lines. The simultaneous operatorsʹ activity in the same assembly station suggests considering com-patibility/incompatibility between the different mounting positions, equipment sharing, and worker cooperation. The management of all these aspects significantly increases the balancing problem complexity due to the determination of the start/end times of each task. This paper proposes a new mixed‐integer programming model to simultaneously optimize the line efficiency, the line length, and the workload smoothness. A customized procedure based on a simulated annealing algorithm is developed to effectively solve this problem. The aforementioned procedure is applied to the balancing of the real assembly line of European sports car manufacturers distinguished by 665 tasks and numerous synchronization constraints. The experimental results present remarkable performances obtained by the proposed procedure both in terms of solution quality and computation time. The proposed approach is the practical reference for efficient multi‐manned assembly line design, task assignment, equipment allocation, and mounting position management in the considered industrial fields. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Since late 2019, a novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally. As a result, businesses were forced to send their workforce into remote working, wherever possible. While research in this area has seen an increase in studying and developing technologies that allow and support such remote working style, not every sector is currently prepared for such a transition. Especially the manufacturing sector has faced challenges in this regard. In this paper, the mental workload of two groups of participants is studied during a human-robot interaction task. Participants were asked to bring a robotised cell used in a dispensing task to full production by tuning system parameters. After the experiment, a self-assessment of the participants' perceived mental workload using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was used. The results show that remote participants tend to have lower perceived workload compared to the local participants. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper proposes a feedback framework that adjusts human workload and productivity by instructing work tempo and personalizes work according to individual differences. For feedback of optimal work tempo, this study proposes a human worker state transition model to investigate the effects of work tempo instructions on workload and productivity. Based on the results obtained, we proposed a feedback policy using our proposed worker state transition model. By testing our proposed framework in a picking task, we showed the possibility to balance productivity and workload. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to construct a task assignment model for U-shaped production lines with collaborative task, which is optimized by minimizing the number of workers and balancing the workload of the operators. The ultimate goal is to increase productivity by increasing the U-line balance and balancing the load on the operators. Design/methodology/approach: First, task selection and update mechanism are analyzed and the task selection mechanism suitable for collaborative task is proposed. Second, M-COMOSAL is obtained by improving the original COMOSAL. Finally, The M-COMOSAL algorithm and the COMAOSAL algorithm are used to perform job assignment on the double-acting clutch U-shaped assembly line. Findings: According to the allocation scheme obtained by M-COMSOAL, the beat can be adjusted according to the change of order demand. The final allocation scheme is superior to the COMSOAL algorithm in terms of number of workers, working time, production tempo and balance rate. In particular, compared with the old scheme, the new scheme showed a decrease of 16.7% in the number of employees and a 18.8% increase in the production line balance rate. Thus, the method is helpful to reduce the number of operators and balance the workload. Originality/value: The new algorithm proposed in this paper for the assignment of collaborative task can minimize the number of workers and balance the load of operators, which is of great significance for improving the balance rate of U-shaped production lines and the utilization of personnel or equipment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Seru production can reduce makespan, labor hours and manpower by improving workers’ workload balance based on the reconfiguration of workers. Therefore, this study focuses on the fundamental principles of seru system balancing. For a seru, we define and formulate seru balance (SB) to describe workloads balance of the workers in the seru. For a seru system containing more serus, the seru system balance (SSB) needs to be evaluated from workloads balance of all workers and workloads balance among all serus. Consequently, we define and formulate intra-seru system balancing (Intra-SSB) and inter-seru system balancing (Inter-SSB) to evaluate the two perspectives respectively. We theoretically develop the lower and upper bounds of Intra-SSB and Inter-SSB respectively. In addition, we define and formulate the seru system balancing problem (SSBP) as a bi-objective model with maximizing Intra-SSB and Inter-SSB simultaneously. The property of solution space for SSBP is analyzed. Finally, we develop an improved algorithm based on ε-constraint for SSBP. The algorithm saves computation time by cutting non-Pareto-optimal solutions before performing ε-constraint. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Manual assembly processes are largely performed today in the industry to benefit from human features of dexterity and flexibility. For this reason, the human factor should be properly regarded when designing assembly processes and systems, where repetitive and physically demanding operations are frequent. This work aims to present and validate a software tool for solving a bi-objective version of the assembly line balancing problem, in which, besides the efficiency of the process, the optimization of ergonomics is pursued. The software, based on a genetic algorithm, aims to distribute assembly tasks on the line to smooth the energetic workload among the different workers assigned to manual workstations, considering their physical capabilities and limits. To validate the system and assess its robustness, tests for different case studies taken from the industrial reality are presented and discussed, together with a sensitivity analysis conducted on problem parameters. Experimental results show that the developed tool optimizes the two objectives in different scenarios, thus demonstrating its profitable use in the industrial reality for planning manual assembly processes that do not overload workers assigned to the line. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The shortage of medical-grade personal protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers is an important issue during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The demand placed on textile manufacturers to rapidly produce products that adhere to a set of standard quality assurance requirements has increased dramatically, leading to increased burden on quality assurance floors and national testing labs. Standardized testing of protective equipment is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that requires human operators to perform tasks that can be automated using various technologies, such as collaborative robots and computer vision systems. The tests we focus on involve evaluating surgical masks and protective materials for blood penetration resistance, flammability, and liquid barrier performance. This work introduces a test cell designed to accommodate human operators in completing various quality assurance tests for protective equipment. The test cell is comprised of custom-designed cases containing test specimens to facilitate robot manipulation and cameras to monitor and characterize the test results. We demonstrate how the system can reduce the workload and reliance on human operators at no expense to the quality assurance process. Based on validation test results and user experience, it is predicted that the human operator will only have to prepare cases with test specimens and handle infrequent failures that occur within the system, without compromising overall completion time. We envision that this system will relieve the strain on textile manufacturing processes requiring human labor to repeatedly perform simple tasks. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Many process improvement initiatives have been performed in response to increasing demands on the United States healthcare system. Some of these initiatives have included Lean manufacturing principles. An important Lean principle is heijunka, which is the balancing of workload. Balanced workload levels are important for human performance and efficiency because they prevent workers from being under or overworked, which aids in increasing motivation, reducing fatigue, and avoiding errors. This study uses simulations to evaluate how task sharing influences the balance of medical staff mental workload in an in-patient unit. The simulation indicates that task sharing in the modeled unit will improve the balance of idle time and time-weighted average workload; however, in this scenario task sharing makes overload time more unbalanced. © 2018 Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).

AB  - Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in the Philippines has become an ordeal in the manufacturing industry. WMSDs are injuries in both muscle and skeletal systems of the body caused by repetitive tasks, prolonged and strenuous range of actions done by most people. Workers experiencing various WMSDs are associated with increased absenteeism, less productivity, and physical and psychological stress. The study aims to identify and analyze statistically significant variables contributing to work-related musculoskeletal disorders, particularly postural related considerations in the lower back, experienced by machinists in a steel manufacturing company. Through correlation and multiple regression analysis, results showed that Height (p-value = 0.001), Weight (p-value = 0.001), Noise (p-value = 0.000), Temperature (p-value = 0.002), Load Weight (p-value = 0.014), BMI (p-value = 0.047), Sleep Quality (p-value = 0.044) and Workload (p-value = 0.007) contributes to the WMSDs experienced by the machinists. Recommendations such as medical examinations, worker's education in the use of PPEs, suitable ventilations, adequate working space, and worker's physical fitness is expected to minimize the risk of WMSDs among workers. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In today's economy, the necessity for responsiveness to variations in customers’ permanent requirements is increasing significantly. Achieving immediate response or success in the competitive market requires boosting flexibility, agility, and efficiency in utilizing available production equipment and workforce. Implementing a Virtual Cellular Manufacturing System (VCSM) prevents the reconfiguration costs and is suitable for many systems where the machines are not removable. Owing to the significant role of human resources in VCMS, this paper assigns the workers based on their skills, interest in cooperation, and workload balancing among cells. The considerable novelty is balancing physical and time workloads simultaneously. Another strength of this research is the consideration of various routes to process each part. A comprehensive linear multi-objective mathematical model is developed for a virtual cellular manufacturing system. This paper develops the model by stating social and technical dimensions, which minimize exceptional elements and voids, maximize the workers' interest in cooperation, and minimize workload deviation. Stemming from uncertain parameters, a robust possibilistic approach is addressed. Due to the multi-objective model, the multi-choice meta-goal programming with the utility function is applied. Afterward, a real-case study is presented to validate the model. Eventually, the outcomes and sensitivity analysis are brought up. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose-Walking-worker assembly lines can be regarded as an effective method to achieve the above-mentioned characteristics. In such systems, workers, following each other, travel workstations in sequence by performing all of the required tasks of their own product. As the eventual stage of assembly line design, efforts should be made for capacity adjustments to meet the demand in terms of allocating tasks to workers via assembly line balancing. In this context, the purpose of this study is to address the balancing problem for multi-model walking-worker assembly systems, with the aim of improving planning capability for such systems by means of developing an optimization methodology. Design/methodology/approach-Two linear integer programming models are proposed to balance a multi-model walking-worker assembly line optimally in a sequential manner. The first mathematical programming model attempts to determine number of workers in each segment (i.e. rabbit chase loop) for each model. The second model generates stations in each segment to smooth workflow. What is more, heuristic algorithms are provided due to computational burden of mathematical programming models. Two segment generation heuristic algorithms and a station generation heuristic algorithm are provided for the addressed problem. Findings-The application of the mathematical programming approach improved the performance of a tap-off box assembly line in terms of number of workers (9.1 per cent) and non-value-added time ratio (between 27.9 and 26.1 per cent for different models) when compared to a classical assembly system design. In addition, the proposed approach (i.e. segmented walking-worker assembly line) provided a more convenient working environment (28.1 and 40.8 per cent shorter walking distance for different models) in contrast with the overall walking-worker assembly line. Meanwhile, segment generation heuristics yielded reduction in labour requirement for a considerable number (43.7 and 49.1 per cent) of test problems. Finally, gaps between the objective values and the lower bounds have been observed as 8.3 per cent (Segment Generation Heuristic 1) and 6.1 (Segment Generation Heuristic 2). Practical implications-The proposed study presents a decision support for walking-worker line balancing with high level of solution quality and computational performance for even large-sized assembly systems. That being the case, it contributes to the management of real-life assembly systems in terms of labour planning and ergonomics. Owing to the fact that the methodology has the potential of reducing labour requirement, it will present the opportunity of utilizing freed-up capacity for new lines in the start-up period or other bottleneck processes. In addition, this study offers a working environment where skill of the workers can be improved within reasonable walking distances. Originality/value-To the best knowledge of the author, workload balancing on multi-model walking-worker assembly lines with rabbit chase loop(s) has not yet been handled. Addressing this research gap, this paper presents a methodology including mathematical programming models and heuristic algorithms to solve the multi-model walking-worker assembly line balancing problem for the first time. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Occupational safety has become a major issue in the construction industry over the years. Studies have shown that work-related accidents are mostly caused by the unsafe behaviors of construction workers, implying that they can be avoided with the appropriate safety training. With emerging technologies being increasingly implemented in the construction industry, there is a growing need to improve pedagogical techniques to equip workers with the multidisciplinary skills required to safely accomplish construction tasks. Construction robots are fine examples of such technologies that necessitate more effective training, as their adoption in the field is closely tied to workers’ safety. However, there is a lack of robust safety training methods for working with robots that can ensure the effectiveness of the training process. To address this issue, this study proposes a virtual avatar-based training platform for collaborating with construction robots. The proposed training platform uses workers' physiological signals to evaluate the training process throughout a human-robot collaboration (HRC) task. Using a deep neural network architecture, workers' cognitive load, a crucial factor of effective learning, was identified and linked to safety performance during the HRC task. The study results highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed training platform and its capability to evaluate the cognitive load during the HRC training in construction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, the automotive industry requires an increased use of intelligent systems to endure. In this paper, we present a new solution for automated task scheduling to help automotive industry in efficiently managing garage employees' time and improving the effectiveness of the servicing and maintenance tasks of vehicles. The developed approach consists in a set of interconnected web applications with a model-view-controller based-on architecture and expert-knowledge temporal logic rules to automate the assignment of the daily workload for engineers working on multiple workstations within an automotive company. The proposed intelligent system prioritises and selects tasks for these engineers; the scheduled tasks being automatically ordered and displayed accordingly on screens visible in the related garage workstations. This automated task scheduling system has been successfully deployed within Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd Company, and the performance of this new application used by a group of engineers under real-world operational conditions have been assessed and analysed.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Industry 5.0 complements Industry 4.0 aiming to create a sustainable, human-centered, and resilient industry. In this context, enabling technologies, such as artificial intelligence, internet of everything, and digital twins, can be used to monitor and enhance the workforce to improve the efficiency and resilience of the entire manufacturing system. By developing socio-technical digital twin architectures, companies will be able in the short future to monitor machines, products, and workers' real-time states as a whole ecosystem. In this study, the authors focus their attention on human digital twin solutions for manufacturing systems, enabling dynamic scheduling of jobs by minimizing the makespan and considering a set of workers' parameters that are continuously monitored through an ergonomic digital platform. This paper proposes the architecture of a real-time monitoring system and how it can help detect awkward postural behavior or unbalanced workload among workers, according to their individual features. At the same time, the system interacts with the human digital twin system which proposes a rescheduling of the jobs whenever it is necessary. Finally, a discussion on the practical limitations of human digital twin implementations in industrial environments is provided. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In the scheduling of assembly lines with human-robot collaboration, variations in workload caused by differences in the available working hours of workers and robots must be minimized. A scheduling method that considers buffers shared by automated guided vehicles and cooperative assembly by multiple workers is proposed herein. In particular, cooperative work requires an assembly schedule that minimizes the make span and satisfies the delivery date, while accounting for the possibility of work partitioning, the number of workers, as well as their available time slots and skills. Hence, it is difficult to obtain an exact optimal solution within a reasonable computation time using existing methods such as mathematical programming. Heuristic or metaheuristic approaches are effective for solving this problem. However, these approaches are not suitable for cooperative assembly by multiple workers. Therefore, a genetic algorithm supported by dispatching rules with four genes is proposed. Computational experiments are conducted based on multiple worker skills. The results showed that when the worker skills are the same, the genetic representation of the job name and part processing order is effective, whereas when the worker skills are different, the genetic representation of the cooperative process with the worker for each operation is effective. © 2023 Korean Society for Precision Engineeing.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is becoming increasingly widespread in today's production systems, as it can contribute to achieving more efficient and flexible production systems. Given the growing importance of HRC, this paper addresses the significance of human workload in HRC. To study workers workload an experiment was conducted using NASA-TLX questionnaire. The experiment featured two scenarios involving the same operation but varying robot motion parameters. Recognizing that individual differences contribute to success of collaboration, the experiment considered worker utilization in relation to robot motion parameters. To ensure the credibility of the experimental results, the robot motion parameters were adjusted to each individual in order to achieve the same conditions and utilization at all participants. Results revealed that worker utilization, in conjunction with robot motion parameters significantly influenced worker workload. The results highlight the need for personalized guidelines in collaborative workplaces that emphasize individual differences in abilities, skills and personalities to increase overall well-being and robot and worker productivity.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of three different sources of social support (supervisor, co-workers, and spouse) on experienced workload and on work-family conflict (WFC) among a population of on-site construction workers in Québec, Canada. The findings of this study contribute to current knowledge by providing evidence of the means by which social support most influences WFC experienced by on-site construction workers (e.g. through workload modulation). More precisely, the study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that social support at work—despite its being limited by so-called masculine culture at the workplace—is instrumental to reduce the adverse effects of workload on WFC. In total, 811 workers in the Québec construction industry took part in this cross-sectional study. Results of mediation analysis show that all sources of social support reduce WFC by diminishing the perception of workload. However, even though workers report less social support from their supervisors than from their spouses, indirect effect analysis shows that supervisor social support is the source that most reduces the perception of workload and, in turn, WFC. Results of the ratio comparison indicate that supervisor and co-worker social support have more important direct impacts on WFC, whereas spousal social support has a more important indirect impact on WFC through a reduction in workload, suggesting that organizations need to foster social support at work (e.g. by promoting a culture of support) in order to ensure that work-family balance is valued at the workplace. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The construction industry is considered one of the world's most demanding, labor-intensive work sectors. Mental workload states of construction workers are known to affect their performance and safety. Previous studies examined construction workers' perceptions and impacts of mental workload on safety and hazard identification. However, there is a need to investigate whether specific task characteristics impact mental workload, and the corresponding impact of the level of mental workload on worker safety when performing tasks. This study is being conducted to evaluate the impacts of task characteristics on mental workload and safety. The study includes an experiment using self-evaluation, galvanic skin response sensors, and observations in a controlled environment to determine participant mental workload and safety impacts. The targeted subject population consists of adults who can perform the study trials. The study findings reveal that task performance differs when subjects are in a hazard-free room compared to when they are located on an elevated work platform, and performance is impacted by increased task complexity. The results can be used to assess the mental workload of workers to improve safety. The study contributes an understanding of how task characteristics impact mental workload experienced by workers and their safety while performing the work. © CRC 2024. All rights reserved.

AB  - Manufacturing industry depend heavily on logistic service provider to distribute their product. Logistic company ussualy work based on order from manufacturer. Depending on the circumtances, orders received by logistic service provider in most cases are uncertain. Fluctuations or uncertainty of order becomes a problem to many logistic companies because it affects the way they have to schedule their workers. Workforce scheduling is hence necessary for allocating appropriate worker in the right place and in the right time. Inappropriate workforce scheduling could imbalance workloads within workers which leads to worker dissatisfaction. This study therefore aims to design a workforce scheduling that consider worker workload of Domestics Freight Forwarding particularly in Company X. The research will first measure the workload, both physical and mental workload. The method used for physical workload measurement is based on calorie consumptions based on Indonesia National Standard (SNI). Whereas NASA-TLX subjective approach method is used to measure mental workload. Then, by using the result of the workload measurements, a workforce scheduling model is designed to balance the workload. Goal programing is used to model the workforce scheduling. The result of workload measurement shows that workers have low productivity but high level of mental workload, while for the physical workload there is no significant difference in each warehouse and shipping. In order to increase the utility of the workers, instead of 3 shifts it is suggested that company apply 2 shifts work systems for Checker. Also, minimizing factors that reduce the productivity such the mobility of outstation (dinas luar). © 2015

AB  - Although the workstations of a Brazilian automotive electrical harness production line are set close to TAKT time (the production rate required to meet demand), factory performance is compromised regarding: (i) sick leaves due to occupational disease (105 employees last year) and (ii) a production rate at only 42% of capacity. Our objective was to simulate the performance of a production line balanced against physical overload by the addition of an extra workstation. Based on ergonomic work analysis, the study applied System Dynamics at the global observation stage to obtain a systemic interpretation of the factors involved in production line performance. According to the indicators, the alternative configuration reduced physical overload by 36%, which would result in a sick leave rate of 50.8 employees/year (51.6% lower than the current configuration), as well as a production rate at 99% of capacity (a 92.7% increase over the current configuration). We found that reducing physical overload allows the “workforce control” loop to govern the system, producing favorable results. We conclude that setting the work cycle overly close to TAKT time leads to overload, due to the shorter recovery times at the end of each cycle. Thus, it is necessary to seek a balance between efficiency gains through downtime reduction and the physiological recovery of workers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Information support systems for coping with and mastering increasing process complexity are becoming a success factor for many companies. The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for reducing the cognitive load for humans working in quality control (QC) for production processes that adhere to the 6σ -methodology. While 100% QC requires every part to be inspected, this task can be reduced when a human-in-the-loop QC process gets supported by an anomaly detection system that only presents those parts for manual inspection that have a significant likelihood of being defective. This approach shows good results when applied to image-based QC for metal textile products. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Introduction: One of the most important factors affecting quality of work-life (QWL) is the workload in the form of mental and physical. The increased workload may reduce the level of performance of workers. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the relation of the mental and physicalworkload with the QWLof workers in the foundry industry. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 218 male workers in a foundry industry and the work units with high work stress were selected. The NASA-TLX, physical load and the Walton questionnaires were used to collect and evaluate the workload and the QWL.The SPSS software was used for data analysis. Results: It was clarified that there was a significant inverse relationship between QWL with physical load (P = 0.001) and mental workload (P = 0.01). The comparison of mean QWL between different groups of demographic variables showed that the only significant relationship was between different age groups and QWL (P = 0.003). Finally, it was found that the variables of physical load, mental workload and age had a significant simultaneous effect on the mean score of QWL (P<0.05). Conclusion: The findings showed that there was a significant relationship between QWL and mental and physical workloads. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - In the technological advancement known as Industry 4.0, the strategic implementation of flow production lines is essential for mass customization. As manual assembly production lines rely on the high flexibility and adaptability of human workers, it is important to consider human-centric, a key value of Industry 5.0, in addition to improving production efficiency. Worker assignment in manual assembly production lines is crucial, as it directly influences both the efficiency of the line and the workload of the workers. However, it is difficult to derive the optimal worker assignment by considering a number of complex factors. Therefore, we propose a data-driven worker assignment methodology using reinforcement learning for multi-objective optimization in manual assembly production lines. A case study is conducted in a laboratory environment that mimics a manufacturing site, and the proposed methodology is validated by comparing it with existing worker assignment methods. It is expected that future research on data-driven multi-objective optimization problems for manual assembly production lines will be diversified based on this paper. © IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2024.All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Fatigue is believed as a common problem that is often encountered by workers including food makers in home industry. Fatigue is caused by various factors such as nutritional status, calories intake and workload. This study is intended to identify the correlation between caloric intake, and workload with fatigue on workers who work at home industry of sumpia, bidaran and tempe in Surabaya. Metods: This study was an observational study with cross sectional design. The samples of this study were all workers in Sinar Kencana Rangkah Home Industry, Sinar Kencana Lebak Jaya Home Industry and Bu Slamet Home Industry in Surabaya. Data were collected by measuring food recall 24 hours, measuring workload, and using questioner of fatigue. Data were presented on the table then were analyzed using Spearman Correlation Test. Results: The result showed that there were correlations between caloric intake (correlation coefficient: 0,530), and workload (correlation coefficient: 0.939) with work fatigue. Conclusion: The lesser the calories intake of the workers, the more severe the work fatigue experienced. The heavier the workload given to the workers, the more severe the work fatigue underwent by the workers. © 2019 IJOSH All right reserved.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR), with its strong ability to enhance how a user interacts with the digital model and the real environment, has great potential to optimize the conventional construction process. Not only the design and planning phase decisions, but also the on-site job accuracy and efficiency can be improved through AR. Furthermore, the development and application of head mounted devices (HMD) provide the workers a new hands-free method to interact with digital model on the site. However, human factor aspects of HMD AR use in construction, such as human computer interaction (HCI) optimization, hardware clumsiness, and safety monitoring are still not well studied. Hence, evaluating the user's mental and physical workload can be an effective way to understand how a worker might react to this new construction mode. Since it is a new attempt to monitor the mental workload during the HMD AR use with construction activities, in this paper, we reviewed the previous studies in mental workload evaluation, and introduced a possible approach to study this problem. Different types of mental workload evaluating methods such as electroencephalogram (EEG), and NASA-TLX were discussed based on their pros and cons in this field. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Construction workers are commonly subject to ergonomic risks due to awkward working postures or lifting/carrying heavy objects. Accordingly, accurate ergonomic assessment is needed to help improve efficiency and reduce risks. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of construction activities makes it difficult to unobtrusively collect worker behavior data for analysis. To address this issue, an automatic workload approach is proposed for the first time to continuously assess worker body joints using image-based three-dimensional (3D) posture capture smart insoles, and biomechanical analysis to provide detailed and accurate assessments based on real data instead of simulation. This approach was tested in an experiment, indicating that the method was able to automatically collect data concerning the workers' 3D posture, estimate external loads, and provide the estimated loads on key body joints with an error rate of 15%. In addition to helping prevent construction workers' ergonomic risks, the method provides a new data collection approach that may benefit various behavior research fields related to construction safety and productivity management. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore how organizational support and quantitative workload influence work-related fatigue. We collected 688 questionnaires from product line workers in 6 Chinese iron and steel factories. Confirmatory factor analysis and bootstrapping were used in the data analysis, and structural equation modeling was adopted to test the hypothetical model. The results showed that intrinsic motivation fully mediates the relationship between organizational support and work-related fatigue, while partly mediating the relationship between quantitative workload and work-related fatigue. The results of this study indicate the potential benefit of improving motivation to alleviate work-related fatigue. Finally, this study puts forward suggestions for future studies. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of workers’ perceived workload, accident experiences, supervisors’ safety leadership, and an organization's safety climate on the cognitive and emotional risk perception. Methods: Six hundred and twenty employees in a variety of manufacturing organizations were asked to complete to a questionnaire. Among them, a total of 376 employees provided valid data for analysis. To test the hypothesis, correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were used. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS program, version 23. Results: The results indicated that workload and accident experiences have a positive influence and safety leadership and safety climate have a negative influence on the cognitive and emotional risk perception. Workload, safety leadership, and the safety climate influence perceived risk more than accident experience, especially for the emotional risk perception. Conclusion: These results indicated that multilevel factors (organization, group, and individual) play a critical role in predicting individual risk perceptions. Based on these results, therefore, to reduce risk perception related with unsafe behaviors and accidents, organizations need to conduct a variety of safety programs that enhance their safety climate beyond simple safety-related education and training. Simultaneously, it needs to seek ways to promote supervisors’ safety leadership behaviors (e.g., site visits, feedback, safety communication, etc.). In addition, it is necessary to adjust work speed and amount and allocate task considering employees’ skill and ability to reduce the workload for reducing risk perception. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The present study describes the development of a wearable device designed to assist those who work in an unstructured posture. In the manufacturing sector, industrial accidents have been steadily on the rise due to poor work environments and excessive workloads imposed on workers. Against this backdrop, the present study aimed to analyze various types of work, especially those performed in unstructured postures by heavy industry workers, who are frequently exposed to high workloads and poor work environments. Based on the analysis results, an attempt was made to develop a shoulder muscle-assistive wearable device capable of assisting a wearer who is working using their shoulder muscles. Various types of unstructured posture work are performed in heavy industries, including activities such as the welding and grinding of ship components and plant structures. They are typically conducted in narrow spaces with limited postures, causing many workers to suffer muscle fatigue. In the present study, as the first step of developing a shoulder muscle-assistive wearable device, different working scenarios were simulated, and the corresponding motion data and required torque values were estimated using motion capture devices. The obtained motion data and required torque values were reflected in the design of the wearable device. The main structural body of the shoulder muscle-assistive wearable device was made of a carbon fiber-reinforced composite to be lightweight. This shoulder muscle-assistive wearable device was designed to fully cover the range of motion for workers working in unstructured postures while generating the torque required for a given job, thereby enhancing the muscular endurance of the workers. The gravity compensation module of the designed shoulder muscle-assistive wearable device generates a support force of 4.47 Nm per shoulder. The shoulder muscle assistive wearable device was developed to provide support for approximately 30% of the shoulder joint’s maximum torque generated in overhead tasks. This shoulder muscle-assistive wearable device is expected to contribute to improving the productivity of field workers, while reducing the occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries arising from the aging of the working-age population. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) solutions are in the process of entering a broad variety of industries to modify the capabilities of workers through (close to) real-time display of context-dependent information. An example for real-time training is the display of instructional materials, such as manuals, for operation and maintenance. Especially in industrial settings, this will allow for the enhancement of workforce capabilities in real-time. However, little is known with respect to the cognitive load that is incurred as a result of this process, which might hinder the realization of desired outcomes. In this paper, we evaluate visual tasks with respect to the cognitive load based on electroencephalography (EEG) employing existing and new metrics utilizing a publicly available data set. In turn, we provide an initial quantified and directly measured approach. We find that overall results are highly subjective, but already available commercial equipment can readily be employed to determine the cognitive load with R2 scores around 0.5 when utilizing k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) approaches directly. More intricate metrics at different measurement points could thus help detect and alleviate undesired stressors in industrial augmented reality settings. © 2017 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press

AB  - The safety of construction workers is always a major concern at construction sites as the construction industry is inherently dangerous with many factors influencing worker safety. Several studies concluded that psychological factors such as workload, organizational relationships, mental stress, job security, and job satisfaction have significant effects on workers' safety. However, research on psychological factors that are characteristic of different age groups have been limited. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of psychological factors on the perception of worker safety for two different age groups. After an extensive literature review, different psychological factors were identified, and a hypothetical research model was developed based on psychological factors that could affect workers' perception of safety. A survey instrument was developed, and data were collected from seven different construction sites in Pakistan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothetical model for both age groups. The results revealed that workload and job satisfaction are significantly dominant factors on workers' perception of safety in older workers, whereas organizational relationships, mental stress, and job security are dominant factors for younger workers at construction sites. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Autonomous systems provide tangible benefits in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) by reallocating work from human operators to suitable machine substitutes. However, improper implementations of autonomy in HCI systems have led to dire consequences. As such, the expansion of autonomy in research and industry must be matched by solutions that properly balance the interaction between human and machine. Early human-computer teams relied on multiple human operators working with one or just a few complex machines. With the growth of technology and improved autonomy, however, this trend has gradually reversed in that multiple complex machines are now supervised and operated by individual human controllers. Past research suggests that simply increasing autonomy fails to address the imbalance between human and machine within a cooperative mission scenario. Instead, adaptive automation has been demonstrated to be a viable solution in balancing the degree of autonomy between human and machine. Previous studies have verified the existence of relationships between levels of autonomy, human cognition, and system performance. In the context of single-operator multiple-agent scenarios, adaptive systems allow the levels of automation to dynamically adapt to the needs of both the human and the machine. This research explores various methods of invoking adaptive automation that aims to balance the level of automation between the human and machine within a simulated multitasking scenario. As such, a military-inspired simulation was designed and implemented to compare the effects of different adaptation mechanisms on objective task performance and operator cognitive workload. Comparisons of four adaptation conditions support the use of adaptive automation as opposed to random or adaptable automation mechanisms for maintaining overall mission performance requirements. Results indicate increased operator utilization and situation awareness over time with decreased subjective workload scores in the adaptive conditions compared to the adaptable and random automation conditions. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Using robot manipulators in contexts where it is undesirable or impractical for humans to physically intervene is crucial for several applications, from manufacturing to extreme environments. However, robots require a high degree of intelligence to operate in those environments, especially if they are not fully structured. Teleoperation compensates for this limitation by connecting the human operator to the robot using human-robot interfaces. The remotely operated sessions can also be used as demonstrations to program more powerful autonomous agents. In this article, we report a thorough user study to characterise the effect of simple vibrotactile feedback on the performance and cognitive load of the human user in performing teleoperated grasping and manipulation tasks. The experiments are performed using a portable and affordable bilateral teleoperation system that we designed, composed of a Leap Motion sensor and a custom-designed vibrotactile haptic glove to operate a 4-fingered robot hand equipped with 3-axis force sensors on the fingertips; the software packages we developed are open-source and publicly available. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback improves teleoperation and reduces cognitive load, especially for complex in-hand manipulation tasks. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Current developments in digitized industrial manufacturing lead to work processes that are highly complex, frequently change and thus increase workload of staff. In this respect, assistive technologies have the potential to aid workers in better coping with increasing workload and requirements and consequently, maintaining good working experience(s). However, existing research on interactive assistive technologies has hitherto largely neglected work experience as a measurable construct. We addressed this shortcoming by conducting a subjective study that assesses different work experience dimensions in the context of interactive augmented reality assembly instructions, in a realistic industrial setting, with a decent sample size (N=48). In this study, we assessed work experience along the dimensions of perceived utility, hedonic user experience, and satisfaction with the assistive technologies used. On behalf of this approach we were able to detect a significant effect between perceived utility and satisfaction. In addition, we summarize lessons learned from this study as well as resulting implications and discuss open challenges for a research agenda on work experience in industry 4.0 contexts. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The increase in automated capabilities of small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) has enabled the human operators to manage larger numbers of vehicles simultaneously. As this happens, the operational paradigm shifts to an m:N configuration where multiple operators (m) are managing multiple vehicles (N) together. However, many questions about how operators will interact with each other and share interaction across the vehicle pool are yet unanswered. Therefore, stakeholders from government and industry have partnered to develop ground control station concepts for such operations. The work presented in this paper aims to identify factors that contribute to operator workload. A supervised machine learning-based method built using Support Vector Machines and K-fold cross-validation was used to create workload prediction models for various NASA TLX subscales by leveraging features related to interactions and their relative timings during m:N operations. Results show that the models yielded fairly high predictive accuracies ranging from ~ 60-75%. © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a novel time-driven mathematical model for trust is developed considering human-multi-robot performance for a Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) framework. For this purpose, a model is developed to quantify human performance considering the effects of physical and cognitive constraints and factors such as muscle fatigue and recovery, muscle isometric force, human (cognitive and physical) workload, workloads due to the robots' mistakes, and task complexity. The performance of multi-robot in the HRC setting is modeled based upon the rate of task assignment and completion as well as the mistake probabilities of the individual robots. The human trust in HRC setting with single and multiple robots is modeled over different operation regions, namely unpredictable region, predictable region, dependable region, and faithful region. The relative performance difference between the human operator and the robot is used to analyze the effect on the human operator's trust in robots' operation. The developed model is simulated for a manufacturing workspace scenario considering different task complexities and involving multiple robots to complete shared tasks. The simulation results indicate that for a constant multi-robot performance in operation, the human operator's trust in robots' operation improves whenever the comparative performance of the robots improves with respect to the human operator performance. The impact of robot hypothetical learning capabilities on human trust in the same HRC setting is also analyzed. The results confirm that a hypothetical learning capability allows robots to reduce human workloads, which improves human performance. The simulation result analysis confirms that the human operator's trust in the multi-robot operation increases faster with the improvement of the multi-robot performance when the robots have a hypothetical learning capability. An empirical study was conducted involving a human operator and two collaborator robots with two different performance levels in a software-based HRC setting. The experimental results closely followed the pattern of the developed mathematical models when capturing human trust and performance in terms of human-multi-robot collaboration. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - We study optimal container unloading and warehouse replenishment at a manufacturing plant. The warehouse inventory is depleted as parts are consumed in the manufacturing process. The inventory level is replenished using the parts stored in sea-containers and trailers available at the plant. Our goal is to determine the optimal team formation, buffer allocation, and job assignment for teams of workers. The teams work at two tandem stations, each with several finite-buffered parallel queues. The objective is to minimize the total time required to process all containers and trailers. There are operational constraints on the number of teams that can be formed, the number of servers in each team, and the number of buffer spaces allotted to each team. We use a simulation-based optimization approach, and the results consistently show a reduction in the processing time. Further, we also observe that the optimal team formation is dependent on the total workload.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In the current 21st century, increasing demand in global markets leads to requirement of high variety of products with reduced manufacturing cost, lesser lead time and perfect quality forcing manufacturing industries to adapt lean concepts since it has proven to be the best manufacturing system. Productivity is a key force and innovation is energy to run and develop an organization well mannered. Lean manufacturing is a production strategy for organizational effectiveness focusing on waste reduction and improving productivity through application of various lean tools. The requirement of lean manufacturing is high due to waste and periodic increase in the cost of manufacturing goods. Value stream mapping is one of the key lean tools used to identify the percentage of value added, non-value added and lead time in processes. Work standardization is important in all manufacturing sectors, which will give better work procedure, manufacturing flow and solution for variability during production. The main objective of this research is to consider the line balancing tool which is carried out in CNC machining chambers for balancing the workload among the workers and helping to increase the employee's utilization. Work standardization is carried out in cycle time of process using time study, video analysis and work study tools and 153 minutes of floor to floor cycle time has been reduced by implementing the same. Simulation using Arena packages was carried out for finding out the amount of productivity improvement in process by eliminating non value added activities. © Totem Publisher, Inc.

AB  - Due to production requirements, solar facilities are usually located in sunny environments where workers face hot weather. Heat is seen as an environmental and occupational hazard with its physiological effects due to high-temperature exposures. Among the heat-related effects are, dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and death. The heat-related impairments on health could also negatively impact the performance of the workers and simultaneously, decrease their productivity. While climate change the already known effects on health could become more frequent, prevalent, and spread. The present investigation provides an analysis of the level of heat stress experienced by a worker based on Wet-bulb Globe Temperature measurements. The study was conducted at a solar energy facility in Mexico. The results show that sometimes workers develop their tasks under conditions above the alert limits of exposure. Solar workers without acclimatization and heavy workload requirements (400 kcal/h) need to rest 75% from an hour and 50% when the workload is moderate (300 kcal/h). Consequently, the percentage of work capacity was established for different scenarios. The period of risk alert during a recorded heat wave, where the worker would mainly require to stop all the physical activities, started at 6:30 am and ended at 6:50 pm. In the final section, preventive measures are suggested. This research aims to contribute with information directed to environmental scientists, standard/policy developers and the solar industry that could improve/develop safety procedures directed toward the heat-related occupational health and safety within solar energy applications under the climate change conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advances in automation and autonomous systems means that the future of work will involve even more cognitive effort. For those in already cognitively demanding work, many of us aim to optimise our effort and productivity to achieve more in work, and ideally to rest outside of work. Neuroergonomics research is concerned with how neurotechnology will help improve work to be manageable and safe, often in e.g. safety critical work, operators experience high demands and mental workload. Meanwhile, Neuroethics is concerned with the largely unregulated future of this industry, involving technologies that are not technically medical devices, but will involve invasive forms of personal data. This work aims to explicate the privacy, trust, and ethical concerns that workers have about employers using neurotechnology to manage their work-forces. An online survey and themes drawn from interviews with factory and office workers are presented. We conclude by discussing these concerns and how they might affect the rapidly expanding neurotechnology industry.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Workload management is of critical concern in the teleoperation of unmanned vehicles because teleoperation is often employed in high-risk industries wherein high workload can lead to sub-optimal task performance and can harm human operators’ long-term well-being. This study aimed to assess the detrimental effects of time delays in teleoperation on operators’ workload and performance, and how a delay compensation aid mitigated such effects. We conducted a human-in-the-loop experiment with 36 participants using a dual-task teleoperation platform, where participants drove a simulated High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and performed a one-back memory task under three conditions: the delay condition, the delay with compensation aid condition, and the ideal no delay condition. A model-free predictor was used as the compensation aid. Results indicate that with a time delay of 0.8-s participants’ workload increased and performance degraded significantly. Moreover, the model-free predictor mitigated the detrimental effects of time delay on workload and task performance. Our findings suggest that participants are more sensitive in their perceived workload compared to the objective and physiological measures of workload. In addition, without any delay compensation algorithms, continuous teleoperation may not be ideal for operations with long time delays. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between collaborative robot (CR) parameters and worker utilization and system performance in human–robot collaboration (HRC) environments. We investigated whether optimized parameters increase workplace efficiency and whether adapting these parameters to the individual worker improves workplace outcomes. Three experimental scenarios with different CR parameters were analyzed in terms of the setup time, assembly time, finished products, work in process, and worker utilization. The main results show that personalized CR parameters significantly improve efficiency and productivity. The scenario in which CR parameters were tailored to individual workers, balanced the workload, and minimized worker stress, resulting in higher productivity compared to non-people-centric settings. The study shows that personalization reduces cognitive and physical stress, promotes worker well-being, and is consistent with the principles of human-centered manufacturing. Overall, our research supports the adoption of personalized, collaborative workplace parameters, supported by the mathematical model, to optimize employee efficiency and health, contributing to human-centered and efficient HRC environments. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Urban air mobility (UAM) is receiving increased attention in aviation as a system for passenger and cargo-carrying new entrants in urban airspace. In order to develop a safe and efficient system, numerous possible concepts of operation for UAM are being explored throughout industry and research domains, the features and assumptions of which may differ according to near, medium and far term operations. Much of the current research into the development of UAM has dominantly focused on technological and engineering capabilities, such as vehicle development. Although these areas of research are essential to furthering UAM, research into the role of the human operator in UAM is limited. The research described in this paper aims to begin to address this gap by investigating the capabilities and implications of human operators as traffic managers in the UAM system, focusing on near-term UAM operations. A human in the loop air traffic control simulation was used to investigate the effect of UAM traffic density, airspace routes and communication procedures on subjective workload and efficiency-related task performance. Findings indicate that medium and high-density operations were associated with high workload. A reduction in verbal communications through a letter of agreement, and optimized routes, were associated with reduced workload and increased performance efficiency. However, even with these adjustments, reported workload remained high, particularly during the high-density scenario. Future research should focus on the human operator roles and responsibilities, and the amount of involvement, in UAM system management. Particular focus should be directed on the impact of reduced human operator involvement and increased automation, on the safety and efficiency of UAM operations and the integration of UAM with traditional air traffic management. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - Product personalization is the global trend driving the development of modern production systems. This in turn creates the need to deploy flexible and reconfigurable assembly systems. New type of factories exploiting the capabilities of multiple resources such as human operators and mobile and / or stationary robot assistants are emerging. This paper investigates the use of digital world modelling techniques in such hybrid production systems for enabling system reconfiguration through shared environment and process perception. The suggested digital world model infrastructure involves three main functionalities: a) Virtual representation of the shopfloor, combining multiple sensor data and CAD models. The digital shopfloor is rendered in the 3D environment exploiting the capabilities provided by Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, b) Semantic representation of the world through the implementation of a unified data model for representing the geometrical as well as the workload state, and c) Dynamic update of the digital twin based on real time sensor and resource data coming from the actual shopfloor. The communication and integration layer among the physical and the virtual agents is realized on top of the ROS framework. The developed infrastructure is applied to an industrial case study from the automotive industry focusing on a car's front axle assembly. Nevertheless, it is designed to be generic enough to be able to address multiple cases. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In the construction industry, diverse safety training styles, such as verbal instructions, pictorial representations, radio-based, video, Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) training, have been employed to improve workers' hazard recognition. However, the impact of these varied training styles on mental workload has been understudied. This research aims to investigate two primary aspects: (1) the influence of different safety training styles on participants' mental workloads, and (2) the variation in mental workload across different training phases. For this purpose, an experimental study was conducted with 20 participants (10 males and 10 females), who were randomly assigned to receive safety instructions either through reading or listening. The training was divided into four phases, each focusing on a specific hazard. Participants' brain activity was monitored using electroencephalography (EEG), and their mental workloads were assessed based on engagement and arousal indices. The results indicated no significant differences in engagement and arousal indexes between the reading and listening groups. However, variations in mental states were observed across different training phases, with increasing arousal levels noted as the training progressed. This study offers insights into the efficiency of different safety training styles and provides valuable recommendations for designing more effective safety training programs to enhance hazard recognition in the construction industry. © 2024 ISARC.

AB  - “KEIROKA” is a new concept of work assistance that aims to simultaneously reduce physical burden and maintain physical capacity with the goal of extending healthy working life. Two important findings are necessary for the appropriate introduction of KEIROKA assistive technologies, such as power-assistive suits and work support robots, into the field. One is to know the physical abilities and skills of each worker. The other is to quantify the work content and physical burden of each worker. We have tested the physical performance of construction workers, conducted questionnaires on back pain, and also measured their physical workload using wearable sensors. The workload did not change with the presence or absence of LBP and age but tended to change with physical ability. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In India, the cashew nut shelling (CNS) is an important task in all small-scale cashew nut processing industries. Workers engaged in CNS task commonly operate pedal-operated cashew nut sheller (CNSR) in awkward standing posture that can contribute to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). However, investigations from an ergonomics perspective have barely been conducted in Indian small-scale cashew nut processing industries. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the postural workload in CNS task to propose an ergonomic design intervention in small-scale cashew nut processing industries. A combination of methods, including posture recording, postural assessment, interviews, questionnaire study, virtual prototyping, and digital human modeling and simulation, were used. Using the pedal-operated CNSR resulted in high-risk postures of MSDs. Based on these preliminary findings, a simple, improved, and adjustable hand-operated CNSR was designed and evaluated ergonomically. It was found that newly designed CNSR improved postures noticeably and provided comfort for workers. © 2022 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.

AB  - The demand for skilled workers and novel manufacturing training solutions has increased with the growing demand for fiber optic cables. Web-based simulations can be used for training, and this paper presents an approach for developing a fiber preform manufacturing browser-based VR simulation. Subsequently, a study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation based on learning gains and learner perception of ease of use, usefulness, intention of use, learning outcomes, and workload. A mixed-methods between-subjects study with 63 participants found that the combination of lecture and simulation was significantly better for perceived usefulness and learning outcomes compared to lecture-only or lecture-and-video conditions. © 2023 Optica Publishing Group.

AB  - Optimal workforce size determination for workload management activities plays an important role in manufacturing systems. Still, the workload distribution problem is a challenging task under multiobjective considerations. This paper proposes a nonlinear multi-objective workload optimisation approach for maintenance systems. The proposed model considered the effects of workers’ absenteeism and accident severity factors on workforce effectiveness and productivity. Consideration is given to conflicting workforce objectives with stochastic and deterministic workforce constraints using a genetic algorithm (GA) as a solution method. The performance of the proposed model is compared with an existing workforce model. GA and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) results are compared on the basis of their performance using the proposed model. It is observed that our model performs better than the existing model. The results from the GA are close to those of the PSO algorithm, while the GA results are better than those of the branch and bound algorithm, obtained from the existing model. The proposed model application shows that it has the capacity to determine optimal workload allocations in maintenance systems. The incorporation of workers’ absenteeism and accident severity factors into this new decision making tool is the core contribution of this study. © 2015 International Society of Management Science and Engineering Management.

AB  - Rapid technological innovations are constantly influencing the complexification and automatization of the work lines pushing human operators to use diverse cognitive processes for supervising complex industrial machines. This urges factories to offer wearable cognitive assistants to human operators to analyze, integrate and maintain a considerable amount of information. The aim of this review is twofold. First, we borrow theoretical elements from the working memory literature to question the way these wearable cognitive assistants could optimize human operators’ cognitive load. Second, we argue that Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Job Characteristics Model (JCM) may theoretically predict the effectiveness of cognitive wearable assistants in enhancing the person–job fit, namely their cognitive performance and well-being. A critical review method was used to collect and summarize the most studied models associated with application of wearable devices in the workplace. Our review suggests that the current literature on working memory give useful insights concerning the way in which information should be displayed to operators to optimize the efficiency of wearable cognitive assistants. Moreover, JCM suggests original explanations on the way they can facilitate access to information and in turn increase job satisfaction. Finally, a small number of studies that used TAM with wearable devices in an industrial setting provide some interesting theoretical and empirical evidence on the acceptance of wearable cognitive assistants. As a conclusion, we argue that using wearable cognitive assistants properly would enhance both cognitive performance and well-being of human operators through promoting the person–job fit. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Advanced manufacturing has resulted in significant changes on the shop-floor, influencing work demands and the working environment. The corresponding safety-related effects, including fatigue, have not been captured on an industry-wide scale. This paper presents results of a survey of U.S. manufacturing workers for the: prevalence of fatigue, its root causes and significant factors, and adopted individual fatigue coping methods. The responses from 451 manufacturing employees were analyzed using descriptive data analysis, bivariate analysis and Market Basket Analysis. 57.9% of respondents indicated that they were somewhat fatigued during the past week. They reported the ankles/feet, lower back and eyes were frequently affected body parts and a lack of sleep, work stress and shift schedule were top selected root causes for fatigue. In order to respond to fatigue when it is present, respondents reported coping by drinking caffeinated drinks, stretching/doing exercises and talking with coworkers. Frequent combinations of fatigue causes and individual coping methods were identified. These results may inform the design of fatigue monitoring and mitigation strategies and future research related to fatigue development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper proposes an adaptive human-machine collaboration paradigm based on machine learning. Human-machine collaboration requires more than letting humans and machines interact according to fixed rules. A decision-maker is needed to assess production status and to activate adaptations that improve productivity and workers' well-being. The proposed solution has been tested in an injection moulding manufacturing line. By introducing a physiological monitoring system and a smart decision-maker, relief from fatigue and mental stress is pursued by adjusting the level of support offered through a cobot. Results reported a reduction of operators' physical and mental workload as well as productivity increase. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess differences in work demands, energetic workload and workers' discomfort and physical effort in two regularly observable workdays in ironwork; one where loads up to 50. kg were handled with two persons manually (T50) and one where loads up to 100. kg were handled manually with four persons (T100). Differences between these typical workdays were assessed with an observational within-subject field study of 10 ironworkers. No significant differences were found for work demands, energetic workload or discomfort between T50 and T100 workdays. During team lifts, load mass exceeded 25. kg per person in 57% (T50 workday) and 68% (T100 workday) of the lifts. Seven ironworkers rated team lifting with two persons as less physically demanding compared with lifting with four persons. When loads heavier than 25. kg are lifted manually with a team, regulations of the maximum mass weight are frequently violated. Statement of relevance: Loads heavier than 25. kg are frequently lifted during concrete reinforcement work and should be lifted by a team of persons. However, the field study showed that loads above 25. kg are most of the time not lifted with the appropriate number of workers. Therefore, loads heavier than 25. kg should be lifted mechanically. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - The Aeronautics industry has pioneered safety from digital checklists to moving maps that improve pilot situational awareness and support safe ground movements. Today, pilots deal with increasingly complex cockpit environments and air traffic densification. Here we present an intelligent vision system, which allows real-time human-machine interaction in the cockpits to reduce pilot’s workload. The challenges for such a vision system include extreme change in background light intensity, large field-of-view and variable working distances. Adapted hardware, use of state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms in eye gaze detection allow a smooth, and accurate real-time feedback system. The current system has been over-specified to explore the optimized solutions for different use-cases. The algorithmic pipeline for eye gaze tracking was developed and iteratively optimized to obtain the speed and accuracy required for the aviation use cases. The pipeline, which is a combination of data-driven and analytics approaches, runs in real time at 60 fps with a latency of about 32ms. The eye gaze estimation error was evaluated in terms of the point of regard distance error with respect to the 3D point location. An average error of less than 1.1cm was achieved over 28 gaze points representing the cockpit instruments placed at about 80-110cm from the participants’ eyes. The angular gaze deviation goes down to less than 1° for the panels towards which an accurate eye gaze was required according to the use cases. © 2022 SPIE

AB  - Increase in chronic diseases amongst the U.S. workforce results in reduced productivity and increased medical care costs. The shortage of manpower against the growing demand has also forced many workers to work overtime multiple days a week. It is therefore important to study and understand a worker's health holistically, considering not only physical health but also mental health, work-life balance, stress, and safety. Total worker health takes factors relating to geography, industry, workload, family, travel time, etc. into consideration and thus, is a comprehensive approach to interpret worker health and well-being. This paper aims to study the total worker health of the people employed in the construction industry. An anonymous survey was conducted with worker participants from various construction trades in Seattle, the crane capital of America in 2018. Analysis of the survey results highlighted aspects that could impact total worker health in construction. One of our findings indicated that workers who put in the most physical effort had trouble sleeping at night. The physical demand and pace of work also seemed to be the contributing factors to troubled sleep. Age of the workers was found to play an important role in the commuting patterns and one's ability to maintain a work-life balance. We consider this preliminary understanding of the important aspects key to designing sensible measurements (e.g., well-being index) as well as strategic interventions to promote the well-being of construction workers and facilitate a positive work environment for the industry. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The. present study aims to design a bi-objective bi-level model for a multidimensional Cellular Manufacturing System (CMS). Minimization of the total number of voids and balancing of the workloads assigned to cells are regarded as two objectives at the upper level of the model. However, at the lower level, attempts are made to maximize the workers' interest to work together in a particular cell. To this end, two Nested Bi-Level metahouristics, including Particle Swarm Optimization (NBL-PSO) and a Population-Based Simulated Annealing algorithm (NBI-PBSA), were implemented to solve the model. In addition, the goal programming approach was utilized at the upper level of these algorithms. Further, nine numerical examples were applied to verify the suggested framework, and the TOPSTS method was used to find a better algorithm. Farther mo re, the best weights for upper-level objectives were tuned by using a weight sensitivity analysis. Based 011 computational results of all of the three objectives, when decisions about inter- A nd intra-cell layouts as well as cell formation were simultaneously made in order to balance the assigned workloads by considering voids and workers' interest, making the problem closer to the real world, t he outcomes were found different from their ideal. Finally, \BL-PBSA could perform better than NBL-PSO, which confirmed t he efficiency of the proposed framework. ©2019 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

While individual task performance of the robotic assistance and human operator can be separately optimized, the interaction between humans and robots can lead to emergent effects on collaborative performance. Thus, the performance benefits of increased automation in robotic assistance and its impact by human factors need to be considered. As such, this letter examines the interplay of operator sex, their cognitive fatigue states, and varying levels of automation on collaborative task performance, operator situation awareness and perceived workload, and physiological responses (heart rate variability; HRV). Sixteen participants, balanced by sex, performed metal polishing tasks directly with a UR10 collaborative robot under different fatigued states and with varying levels of robotic assistance. Perceived fatigue, situation awareness, and workload were measured periodically, in addition to continuous physiological monitoring and three task performance metrics: task efficiency, accuracy, and precision, were obtained. Higher robotic assistance demonstrated direct task performance benefits. However, unlike females, males did not perceive the performance benefits as better with higher automation. A relationship between situation awareness and automation was observed in both the HRV signals and subjective measures, where increased robot assistance reduced the attentional supply and task engagement of participants. The consideration of the interplay between human factors, such as operator sex and their cognitive states, and robot factors on collaborative performance can lead to improved human-robot collaborative system designs.  © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Multi-manned workstations, where a worker team synchronously executes different operations on the same product, have the potential to increase disassembly line performance. Despite focusing on main objectives such as workload imbalance and worker performance, existing disassembly line balancing studies have not addressed worker satisfaction. This study addresses the disassembly line worker assignment and balancing problem by considering not only multi-manned workstations with heterogeneous workers, but also workers' preference and performance. A novel multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is formulated with the following objectives: minimizing the number of workers, the number of workstations, workload imbalance, maximizing worker satisfaction, and worker performance. Moreover, this study is proposing heuristics to utilize game theory-oriented approaches in the context of the addressed problem. Some comparative studies were carried out to compare the performance of the proposed heuristics. The effects of the factors were revealed by the statistical analysis conducted on the solutions for newly generated test problems. After the superiority of the proposed heuristics was indicated through comparative studies, they were applied to a washing machine disassembly system in the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) industry. The application indicated the performance improvement for the disassembly lead time (65%) and the space requirement (64%) compared to a classical disassembly system design. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The shift towards a more human-centric manufacturing approach in Industry 5.0 emphasizes the integration of technologies that augment rather than replace human capabilities, highlighting the role of collaborative robots (cobots). These cobots, designed to work closely with human operators, bring adaptability and efficiency to the manufacturing floor, adjusting to various tasks and production needs. This integration, while promising, introduces challenges, especially in terms of human adaptation and learning in dynamic work settings. To date, research has primarily focused on the technological advancement of cobots, often overlooking the human component in this collaborative equation. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by employing pupillometry to explore learning effects within human-robot collaboration (HRC), specifically examining human adaptation to complex and extended tasks reflective of industrial environments. Through a multifactorial design involving 19 participants engaged in three trials repeated for two task difficulty levels, the research analyzes performance metrics along with changes in pupil diameter. The results discovered that repetitive task execution is related to decreased operation time and pupil diameter, suggesting reduced cognitive load levels. These findings imply the potential utility of pupillometry as an indicator of human adaptation to complex task execution, promoting further investigation into physiological measures to optimize cobot integration into the workplace.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - The performance of tasks with high physical loads corresponds very strongly with the necessity for breaks, which should be taken depending on the workload. The actual situation on construction sites is totally different, since breaks were traditionally arranged and almost unchanged over the last decades, with no connection to the workload. This claim was substantiated by a recent survey of supervisors (N = 64) and construction workers (N = 177). The results showed that the majority of respondents would not change the current break arrangement, particularly supervisors, who did not see the importance of an evaluated break distribution. However, a need for change is seen in statements of the construction workers’ unions to reduce stress additionally caused by high temperatures. The suggested new approach for customized breaks in connection to physical loads in this study leads to the following: The overall working time should be split into three almost comparable shares, with a duration of 2.5 to 3.5 hours, to reach a total of 9 to 10 working hours. But even if these breaks are changed in the way we suggest, the authors would recommend additional breaks if the construction workers have to perform very strenuous work, or if climate conditions increase the strain. © 2014 ISEC Press.

AB  - Construction companies can accrue losses due to labor fatalities and injuries. Since more than 70% of all accidents are related to human activities, detecting and mitigating human-related risks hold the key to improving the safety conditions within the construction industry. Previous research has revealed that the psychological and emotional conditions of workers can contribute to fatalities and injuries. Recent observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest that inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, laborers are vulnerable to unexpected hazards while focusing on complicated construction tasks. Therefore, the ability to detect the mental conditions of workers could reduce unexpected injuries. However, there are currently no available measurement approaches or devices capable of monitoring construction workers' mental conditions. The research proposed in this paper aims to develop a measurement approach to evaluate hazards through neural time-frequency analysis. The experimental results show that neural signals are valid for mental load assessment of construction workers, especially the low frequency bands signals. The research also describes the development of a prototype for a wearable electroencephalography (EEG) safety helmet that enables the collection of the neural information required as input for the measurement approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Manufacturing assembly tasks can vary in complexity and level of automation. Yet, achieving full automation can be challenging and inefficient, particularly due to the complexity of certain assembly operations. Human-robot collaborative work, leveraging the strengths of human labor alongside the capabilities of robots, can be a solution for enhancing efficiency. This paper introduces the CT benchmark, a benchmark and model set designed to facilitate the testing and evaluation of human-robot collaborative assembly scenarios. It was designed to compare manual and automatic processes using metrics such as the assembly time and human workload. The components of the model set can be assembled through the most common assembly tasks, each with varying levels of difficulty. The CT benchmark was designed with a focus on its applicability in human-robot collaborative environments, with the aim of ensuring the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Experiments were carried out to assess assembly performance in three different setups (manual, automatic and collaborative), measuring metrics related to the assembly time and the workload on human operators. The results suggest that the collaborative approach takes longer than the fully manual assembly, with an increase of 70.8%. However, users reported a lower overall workload, as well as reduced mental demand, physical demand, and effort according to the NASA-TLX questionnaire. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Introduction: PT. PAL Indonesia (Persero) is a state-owned company in the shipping industry. For running the production cycle, PT. PAL Indonesia (Persero) has several divisions. One of them is the Maintenance and Repair Division. This division involves workers with positions as technicians and managers who have different tasks and functions. These differences will result in unequal physical workloads. The purpose of this study is to analyze the differences in the physical workload of technicians and managers of the Maintenance and Repair Division of PT. PAL Indonesia (Persero). Methods: This study used an analytic observational method with a cross sectional design. The independent variable used in this research was the position of workers consisting of managers and technician staff. Meanwhile, the dependent variable was a physical workload. The research respondents were 24 technicians and 6 managers. Data were obtained through questionnaires and calorimeters to measure calorie needs. Results: The technicians were aged 20-33 years old (62.5%), and the managers were aged 48-61 years (83.3%). Technicians' nutritional status was categorized as normal, as many as 21 people (87.5%) and the nutritional status of managers was overweight, as many as 4 people (66.7%). The physical workload of technicians was in the medium category, as many as 22 people (91.7%) and 5 managers had a moderate physical workload (83.3%). Conclusion: There was no difference in the physical workload of technicians and managers of the Maintenance and Repair Division. This is because PT. PAL Indonesia (Persero) has implemented cooperation in job completion. © 2022 IJOSH All right reserved.

AB  - Cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry, necessitating the requirement for advanced platforms to support their workloads through parallel and distributed architectures. Kubernetes provides an ideal platform for hosting various workloads, including dynamic workloads based on AI applications that support ubiquitous computing devices leveraging parallel and distributed architectures. The rationale is that Kubernetes can be used to support backend services running on parallel and distributed architectures, hosting ubiquitous cloud computing workloads. These applications support smart homes and concerts, providing an environment that automatically scales based on demand. While Kubernetes does offer support for auto scaling of Pods to support these workloads, automated scaling of the cluster itself is not currently offered. In this paper we introduce a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) solution for autoscaling Kubernetes (K8s) worker nodes within a cluster to support dynamic workloads. We go on to discuss scalability issues and security concerns both on the platform and within the hosted AI applications. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In the mining company case study, the volume of mining was increasing and the workload of laboratory and sample house employees was also increasing. It is important to investigate the physical workload after production increasing. The purpose of this study is to analyze and evaluate the physical workload for laboratory and sample house (LSH) departments. Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is used to determine the level of the physical workload. The job description and the competences of employees will be used to understand, calculate, and evenly distribute the physical workload. Furthermore, data is collected through several methods such as discussions, interviews, questionnaires, and observation. The result of the study can provide the best strategy for reducing the unbalance of the physical workload at LSH and this study can be used to determine the cost and impact of recruiting employees based on an analysis of workforce planning as well as for workers, workers can avoid mistakes and can work safely. © IEOM Society International.

AB  - Production lines are increasingly defined by smaller lot sizes that require workers to memorize frequent changes of assembly instructions. Previous research reports positive results of using assistive systems that compensate increments of workload by providing "just-in-time" instructions. However, there is rare evidence to which degree workload is alleviated by using assistive technologies. This work explores the potential of electrodermal activity (EDA) as a real-time monitoring tool for workload that is placed by two different assistive systems during manual assembly. In a preliminary user study (N=18), participants were induced with temporal and mental workload while conducting an assembly task with two different assistive systems: paper instructions and in-situ projections. Our preliminary findings indicate that EDA measures and working performance correlate to workload levels when using both assembly systems. Based on our results, we discuss future research in the area of smart factories that implicitly evaluate workload through EDA in real-time to adapt assistive technologies at workplaces individually during manual assembly. © Authors 2019.

AB  - Today, Digital Twin (DT) represents an emerging topic in Manufacturing and Logistics (M&L) systems due to its role as an enabler of digital transformation in the so-called Smart Factories. It has been widely integrated into maintenance, production planning, and control or layout planning decisions. Several frameworks and surveys have been proposed to provide guidelines, managerial insights, limitations, and future research perspectives on this emerging topic. However, just a few works focus the attention on DT and its role in quantifying, evaluating, and providing ergonomics, mental or physical workload, posture feedback, or warnings to workers, aiming to improve their safety conditions. For this reason, this study investigates the current state of the art in DT and its application as a tool to evaluate and integrate ergonomic aspects, or additional human factors, in M&L systems. Furthermore, future research directions are provided. Copyright © 2022 The Authors. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB  - Collaborative robots are an important enabling technology of Industry 4.0. The interaction between humans and robots, called Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), aims to improve system performance. However, it is necessary to investigate in depth the effects of this close interaction on workers identifying individual factors involved and discerning which of them affect the introduction of HRC in a manufacturing system. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the collaboration between humans and robots, identifying how the operator's work is affected by HRC. A scoping review was conducted to identify the main impacts of HRC on worker's performance. Based on the results, a preliminary taxonomy of key factors influencing the performance of collaborative operators was identified. The results highlighted the importance of trust, usability, and acceptance as key requirements for the successful introduction of HRC, whereas factors as stress and workload of workers are both positively and negatively affected by HRC. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - To design a cellular manufacturing system, many decisions have to be taken into consideration; grouping machines into cells, determining the system and intracellular layouts, and dividing the resources between the cells. In this paper, a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for the integrated cell formation, cellular layout and worker assignment problem. The workers are assumed to have different skill levels, and worker load is based on manual workload and material handling tasks. A genetic algorithm (GA) is further proposed to solve the problem, where the GA chromosome represents locations of machines and assignment of workers to machines. A numerical study is finally conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed GA with regards to solutions attained by solving the MILP model. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed GA in solving the integrated problem, as well as the competence in the developed MILP model. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable devices are increasingly used for assessing physiological data. Industry 4.0 aims to achieve the real-time assessment of the workers’ condition to adapt processes including the current mental workload. Mental workload can be assessed via physiological data. This paper researches the potential of wearable devices for mental workload assessment by utilizing heart rate and motion data collected with a smartwatch. A laboratory study was conducted with four levels of mental workload, ranging from none to high and during sitting and stepping activities. When sitting, a difference in the heart rate and motion data from the smartwatch was only found between no mental workload and any mental workload task. For the stepping condition, differences were found for the movement data. Based on these results, wearable devices could be useful in the future for detecting whether a mental demanding task is currently performed during low levels of physical activity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia changed how people lived and worked, and customer demands and needs continue to change. including how people make transactions that increase digital transactions. E-commerce sales have increased by 25%, according to IdEA, which will affect employee workload and job satisfaction during the pandemic. This research examines how remote working affects job satisfaction in the Indonesian E-Commerce industry. 200 Indonesian remote workers were surveyed quantitatively and analyzed using Smart-PLS software. The study found that remote workers from e-commerce companies in Indonesia had a positive and significant impact on job satisfaction and work-life balance. Workload negatively impacts job satisfaction and work-life balance, while work-life balance positively impacts job satisfaction. This study shows that working remotely can help you balance work and life. This paper provides practical implications for increasing job satisfaction for organizations to be used by HR or leaders to make decisions and needs, such as communication facilities and remote worker discipline.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The proliferation of the industrial digitisation through paradigms such as Industry 4.0 or Industrial Internet of Things have created a more complex work environment for human workers. Even though robots and machines have been created to make workers' jobs easier and less stressful, work-related stress is still present in industrial environments. In addition to the traditional stressors such as workload or strict deadlines, the constant demand for interaction with robots and machines and the poorly designed and unclear interfaces lead to additional cognitive stress for workers. In this poster, we outline a system based on wearable sensors that can collect and store data relevant to the assessment of workers' stress. The sensors measure physiological indicators such as heart rate or respiratory rate, as well as geospatial data that includes GPS coordinates and workers' movement, speed and acceleration. The data generated by the sensors is transmitted to the lightweight on-board unit on the back of the fabrics (T-shirt or bra) and then streamed to the processing unit (Raspberry Pi) via BLE. The collected data will be processed in order to describe the relationships between the stressors and the workers' health status and behavior. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Introduction: Psychosocial hazards are significant threats to the safety and health of workers, particularly in industries such as production. Based on preliminary observations, assembly workers in the production setting, known for requiring precision, face increased risk, specifically when confronted with elevated demand. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze psychosocial hazards among production workers at PT. Sarandi Karya Nugraha. Method: Qualitative descriptive approach was utilized for a case study conducted at PT. Sarandi Karya Nugraha from July to October 2020. A total of 4 informants was selected by purposive methods, and data were collected through in-depth interviews, observations, and document reviews. Meanwhile, thematic analysis was used to analyze the details obtained. Result: The results showed that there are 6 psychosocial hazard themes within the production department. These comprised role ambiguity, role conflict, quantitative workload, qualitative workload, responsibility to others, and career development. In addition, issues related to role conflict, quantitative overload, and career development persisted in the company. Conclusion: Organizations should create plans, policies, and opportunities for workers in the production department to gain assurance regarding career advancement. Additionally, a detailed description of work process in situations comprising quantitative workload should be created. © 2023, IJOSH. All right reserved..

AB  - Flexible job-shop scheduling problem with worker flexibility (FJSPW) has been frequently investigated during the last decade. Many real-world industries proceed with limited multiskilled workers to optimize cost and improve efficiency, and also to overcome the occasional shortage of workers. Owing to the limited flexible workforce, an excessive workload amongst workers can cause stress, exertion, and lack of focus, leading to low productivity. However, such problems caused due to the limited number of workers are generally not investigated in depth in FJSPW. To consider workforce relief and productivity simultaneously, this research proposes the flexible job-shop scheduling problem with limited flexible workers (FJSPLFW) with the objectives to minimize the makespan, maximum worker workload and total workload of machines. An improved multiobjective discrete teaching–learning based optimization (IMDTLBO) algorithm is introduced to solve the FJSPLFW. A teaching–learning based random partial updating of the learners is proposed to enhance the diversity of learners (population) and avoid local optimum. The number of chapters (elements) of the learner to be updated is considered a key parameter and its value is evaluated with other key parameters through the Taguchi method. The IMDTLBO algorithm is tested on FJSPLFW through various experiments based on 30 newly constructed benchmark instances. The results show that the IMDTLBO algorithm is competitive in solving FJSPLFW. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Workers in material handling tasks often suffer from work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) caused by inaccurate work postures or the lifting of excessively heavy loads. Therefore, effective ergonomic assessment of workers is needed to improve worker productivity while reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. This paper proposes a noninvasive method for evaluating posture risks and load analysis in manual material handling tasks. The study focuses on three main aspects: first, using 3D pose recognition technology to extract the 3D coordinates and joint angles of the human body. Second, the REBA method was improved by using fuzzy logic theory to more effectively capture the slow transition features of continuous movement by humans without abruptly altering risk scores, as well as to increase the accuracy and consistency of posture risk evaluation. Third, joint torque and workloads were estimated using biomechanical calculations by integrating pressure insoles and 3D joint coordinate data. Experiments show that this method can effectively evaluate posture risks and workloads in manual material handling tasks, with a correlation coefficient of 0.817 (p<0.01) between fuzzy logic REBA and REBA and an error rate of 15% in estimating workloads of eight joints. This method can help reduce occupational health risks for workers and industries and improve work efficiency.  © 2023 Ziao Wang et al.

AB  - Assembly lines are frequently used as a production method to assemble complex products. Two-sided assembly lines are utilized to assemble large-sized products (e.g., cars, buses, trucks). Locating two lines in parallel helps improve line efficiency by enabling collaboration between the line workers. This paper proposes a mixed-model parallel two-sided assembly line system that can be utilized to produce large-sized items in an inter-mixed sequence. The mixed-model parallel two-sided line balancing problem is defined and the advantages of utilizing multi-line stations across the lines are discussed. A flexible agent-based ant colony optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problem and a numerical example is given to explain the method systematically. The proposed algorithm builds flexible balancing solutions suitable for any model sequence launched. The dynamically changing workloads of workstations (based on specific product models during the production process) are also explored. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted and the results are statistically analyzed using the well-known paired sample t-test. The test results indicate that the mixed-model parallel two-sided assembly line system reduces the workforce need in comparison with separately balanced mixed-model two-sided lines. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the tabu search algorithm and six heuristics often used in the assembly line balancing domain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The flexibility of production systems is becoming more and more important for manufacturers facing various changes. As an effective way to increase the flexibility in a short time with a small investment, multi-skilled workers have received more attention in recent years. In this paper, a multi-skilled worker assignment problem is solved in the context of seru production systems, in which differences in workers’ skill sets and proficiency levels are taken into consideration. Worker grouping, cell loading, and task assignment are solved concurrently in the problem. A mathematical model with objectives of improving the inter-seru and inter-worker workload balance is proposed to solve the problem. In order to verify the proposed model, a numerical example is presented and solved by a sum weighted method. Due to the NP-hard nature of the model, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on NSGA-II is developed. The algorithm is tested by several numerical examples and the impact of differences in workers’ competency on workload balance is analyzed based on the computational results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paradigm shift toward Industry 4.0 is facilitating human capability, and at the center of the research are the workers—Operator 4.0—and their knowledge. For example, new advances in augmented reality and human–machine interfaces have facilitated the transfer of knowledge, creating an increasing need for labor flexibility. Such flexibility represents a managerial tool for achieving volume and mix flexibility and a strategic means of facing the uncertainty of markets and growing global competition. To cope with these phenomena, which are even more challenging in high-variety, low-volume contexts, production planning and control help companies set reliable due dates and shorten lead times. However, integrating labor flexibility into the most consolidated production planning and control mechanism for a high-variety, low-volume context—workload control—has been quite overlooked, even though the benefits have been largely demonstrated. This paper presents a mathematical model of workload control that integrates labor flexibility into the order review and release phase and simulates the impact on performance. The main results show that worker transfers occur when they are most needed and are minimized compared to when labor flexibility is at a lower level of control—shop-floor level—thus reducing lead time. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The study aims to design flexible manufacturing cells with routing flexibility. A weighted mixed-integer linear mathematical programming model that aims to find optimal routing of parts in flexible manufacturing cells under constraints such as minimum machine utilization rate, maximum machine utilization rate, tool capacities, the utilization rate of workers, and labor-system unbalance is developed. The mathematical programming model aims to minimize the weighted sum of five objective functions: (1) the total number of intracellular movements; (2) the total number of intercellular movements; (3) the total workload unbalance of the machine system; (4) the total number of tools in all machines in the cells; and (5) the total labor-system workload unbalance. The main contribution of this study is to obtain these five objectives simultaneously, which have not been encountered to handle together before. By integrating these factors, the study presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing the design of flexible manufacturing cells. This study also has the potential to enhance system performance by addressing these factors. An illustrative problem tests the developed model, and the LINGO 17.0 optimization program is used to solve the generated mathematical programming model. Moreover, the related sensitivity analysis is performed with some parameters to examine the obtained results. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Industrial wool textile production exposes workers mainly to the biomechanical loading of the shoulder joint. In this work context, which is characterized by poor machine ergonomics, exposure to biomechanical risk factors, and variable work organization, exoskeletons could facilitate work processes or could be a valuable means to protect workers from overuse injuries. Field evaluation is essential to verify the suitability of specific devices and their acceptance by users. As part of a pilot study, we examined the short-term subjective effects of a passive Arm-Support Exoskeleton (ASE) on workers performing repetitive overhead tasks. In a textile factory, eight workers participated in the study, answering questionnaires after carrying out a work session with (ASE) and without an exoskeleton (FREE). Participants had been using the Paexo exoskeleton for (Formula presented.) months (min 0–max 12). Subjective evaluations were collected regarding the workload (NASA-TLX) and relief (Borg’s CR10 scale) obtained from the use of the exoskeleton, satisfaction (Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST)), usability (System Usability Scale (SUS)), and opinions on the ergonomics of the device (Ergonomics questionnaire). Workers reported a high workload (NASA (Formula presented.)) and assessed a 46% reduction in effort on the CR10 in ASE conditions compared to FREE. They expressed high satisfaction with most characteristics of the ASE (100% satisfied with durability and effectiveness), high level of usability (62% of scores above 80, out of a maximum score of 100), and ergonomics of the device ((Formula presented.), out of a maximum score of 110). In addition to the objective effects (electromyography (EMG) reduction) already demonstrated in a previous publication, these qualitative results demonstrate a positive perception by textile workers regarding the effectiveness, usability, and suitability of the exoskeleton. The adoption of ASE in the textile industry appears beneficial in the short term, but the impact associated with individual variables and long-term effects remains to be explored. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to test the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model for explaining the intention to use exoskeletons among industrial workers. Background: Exoskeletons could help reduce physical workload and risk for injuries among industrial workers. Therefore, it is crucial to understand which factors play a role in workers’ intention to use such exoskeletons. Method: Industrial workers (N = 124) completed a survey on their attitudes regarding the use of exoskeletons at their workplace. Using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, the UTAUT model and a revised version of the UTAUT model were fitted to these data. Results: The adapted UTAUT model of Dwivedi et al. (2017) was able to explain up to 75.6% of the variance in intention to use exoskeletons, suggesting a reasonable model fit. Conclusion: The model fit suggests that effort expectancy (how easy it seems to use an exoskeleton) plays an important role in predicting the intention to use exoskeletons. Social influence (whether others think workers should use exoskeletons) and performance expectancy (how useful exoskeletons seem to be for work) play a smaller role in predicting the intention to use. Applications: This research informs companies about the optimal implementation of exoskeletons by improving the determinants of acceptance among their workers. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - The recent trends in modern industry highlight an increasing use of robots for a wide range of applications, which span from established manufacturing operations to novel tasks characterized by a close collaboration with the operators. Although human-robot collaboration allows to relieve operators of exhausting works, an effective collaboration requires a straightforward interaction to foster the use of robot assistants. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on human-robot interaction approaches and related interfaces addressed to robot programming. An overview of on-line and off-line robot programming techniques is first presented. Then, novel intuitive interaction means, such as those based on multi-modal interaction, virtual and augmented reality, are considered. The paper aims at pointing out that collaborative robotics can effectively reduce operator's physical workload if easy to use interfaces for robot programming are provided. © 2018

AB  - In human-robot collaboration (HRC), operators work side by side with collaborative robots (cobots), a new type of machines able to function safely on tasks shared with humans. Despite the increasing presence of cobots in factories, the quality of experience associated by workers with HRC is an underexplored topic. This review is focused on the mental workload (MWL) reported by operators interacting with cobots, its major sources, and the potential solutions to optimize it during HRC. Out of 165 papers identified, 23 were selected as specifically devoted to the exploration of workers’ MWL in a HRC activity. Cobot motion, predictability, task organization and communication patterns emerged as the major factors contributing to operators’ MWL during HRC. Endowing cobots with the capacity to meet both task demands and human needs through modulation of motion rhythm, flexible physical interaction, and more efficient communication patterns may contribute to mitigating workers’ MWL. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) is a research hotspot in the shop scheduling problem. However, few studies have investigated HFSP involving parallel machine scheduling and worker competencies. Therefore, this study investigates a complex product assembly line scheduling problem considering parallel team scheduling, worker competencies, and transport time. The makespan, transport time, imbalance degree of team workload, and imbalance degree of cycle time are taken as optimization objectives. First, a mathematical model considering transport time and worker competencies is developed, and then a mixed encoding and decoding method is proposed. Second, an algorithm that hybridizes the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm is proposed, involving an improved Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic method and a strengthened elite retention strategy to improve the quality of the solution. Finally, based on nine examples generated from real production statuses, the proposed algorithm is compared with the other four algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior in terms of the quality and efficiency of solutions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human resources is one of the most important production factors and plays a key role in a manufacturing process. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the performance of human resources as optimal as possible by reducing the unbalanced workload of each element of the existing work. With the increased productivity of human resources, it will also create the productivity of the company. One of the methods used is with work sampling. Work sampling is a technique for analyzing productivity from machine, process, or worker activity. This method is a method of measuring work directly because the observations made directly to the object of observation. The selected object of observation is mechanical PT. Universal Tekno Reksajaya Plant, and the average mechanical productivity is 53.67%. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Both cell design and human issues are important factors for successful implementation of cellular manufacturing. To better implement cellular manufacturing, we investigate the integrated cell formation and worker assignment problem (ICFWAP). A comprehensive linear model is developed for the ICFWAP to determine the optimal allocation of machines, parts and workers. Specific characteristics of this model include the simultaneous consideration of production planning, coexistence of alternative process routings, lot splitting, workload balancing between cells and worker over-assignment to multiple cells. Motivated by the inefficiency of exact approaches, this paper proposes a hybrid approach combining combinatorial particle swarm optimization and linear programming (CPSO-LP) to efficiently solve real-sized problems. In CPSO-LP, decision variables corresponding to part routing selection and part operation assignment are fixed and other variables are allowed to be changed. CPLEX is then used to solve the reduced LP problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed model. Results reveal that worker over-assignment can reduce the number of workers hired and improve labor utilization rate. The better efficiency and effectiveness of CPSO-LP are proved by comparisons with CPLEX, a genetic algorithm (GA), CPSO, and a hybrid approach combining GA and LP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The adoption of a lean production model means a systematic implementation of various management methods and practices. Such a model presents the human element as a key factor in continuous improvement efforts, influencing workers’ job content and the quality of work. However, there are few evidences regarding research on quantitative assessment of the work demand, either psychological or physical, in a lean production environment. Therefore, this study aims to analyze from an ergonomics perspective the psychophysical demand and workers’ perceived workload within assembly cells undergoing a lean production implementation. The proposed method integrates complementary concepts of widely known techniques, enabling the consolidation of several assessment criteria into one particular index for both psychological and physical demands. Such a diagnostic method is illustrated in a case study from the automotive parts manufacturing sector, whose application is performed in three critical assembly cells selected by senior management. Our findings show systemic gaps between work demand and employees’ profile, indicating improvement opportunities in order to provide a better work environment. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Force output and muscle activity represent the gold standards for measuring physical fatigue. This study explores using ocular metrics for tracking changes in physical fatigue during the completion of a repeated handle push/pull task. Participants completed this task over three trials, and pupil size was recorded by means of a head-mounted eye-tracker. Blink frequency was also measured. Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rise of interest in collaborative robotic cells for assembly or manufacturing has been attested by their inclusion among the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0. In collaborative cells, robots work side by side with human operators allowing to address a larger production scope characterized by medium production volumes and significant product variability. Despite the advances in research and the availability of suitable industrial robot models, several open problems still exist, due to the shift in the way of working: correct assessment of the economic profitability, definition of a suitable process plan, task assignment to humans and robots, intuitive and fast robot programming. This paper addresses the task assignment problem by proposing a method for the classification of tasks starting from the hierarchical decomposition of production activities. Task classification is employed for workload distribution and detailed activity planning. The method relays on the assumption that tasks should be allocated, exploiting the different skills and assets of humans and robots, regardless of workload balancing. The proposed method was firstly tested on a simplified assembly process executed in laboratory, then it has been applied to the redesign of an actual industrial process. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Entropy in factories is situated. For example, there can be numerous different ways of picking, orientating, and placing physical components during assembly work. Physical components can be redesigned to increase the Information Gain they provide and so reduce situated entropy in assembly work. Also, situated entropy is affected by the extent of knowledge of those doing the work. For example, work can be done by knowledgeable experts or by beginners who lack knowledge about physical components, etc. The number of different ways that work can be done and the knowledge of the worker combine to affect cognitive load. Thus, situated entropy in factories relates to situated cognition within which knowledge is bound to physical contexts and knowing is inseparable from doing. In this paper, six contributions are provided for modelling situated entropy in factories. First, theoretical frameworks are brought together to provide a conceptual framework for modelling. Second, the conceptual framework is related to physical production using practical examples. Third, Information Theory mathematics is applied to the examples and a preliminary methodology in presented for modelling in practice. Fourth, physical artefacts in factory production are reframed as carriers of Information Gain and situated entropy, which may or may not combine as Net Information Gain. Fifth, situated entropy is related to different types of cognitive factories that involve different levels of uncertainty in production operations. Sixth, the need to measure Net Information Gain in the introduction of new technologies for embodied and extended cognition is discussed in relation to a taxonomy for distributed cognition situated in factory production. Overall, modelling of situated entropy is introduced as an opportunity for improving the planning and control of factories that deploy human cognition and cognitive technologies including assembly robotics. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Safety performance is recognized as the more proximal and effective precursor of safety outcomes. In particular, safety compliance significantly reduces workplace accidents and injuries. However, it is not entirely clear what role organizational factors play in determining workers’ safety. The present study contributes to defining which organizational factors increase safety compliance by testing a mediational model in which supervisor support is related to safety climate, which in turn is related to organizational identification that finally is related to safety compliance. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of 186 production workers of an Italian manufacturing firm using a cross-sectional design. Findings confirm our hypotheses. Management should consider these organizational factors in order to implement primary prevention practices against work accidents. © 2016 Central Institute for Labour Protection-National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the links between work stressors, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion, and workplace aggression, using the traits of negative affectivity and external locus of control as individual moderators. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected using a survey questionnaire among 477 blue-collar workers from a Tunisian manufacturing company. Findings – Results indicate that perceived stress mediates a positive relationship between work stressors (quantitative workload, role ambiguity, and interpersonal conflicts) and emotional exhaustion. Moreover, the relationship between quantitative workload and interpersonal conflicts and perceived stress is stronger among individuals with high levels of negative affectivity. Similarly, the relationship between quantitative workload and perceived stress is stronger at high levels of external locus of control. Finally, emotional exhaustion mediates a positive relationship between perceived stress and interpersonal and organizational aggression. Practical implications – The findings suggest that Tunisian organizations may reduce perceived stress and aggressive behavior among blue-collar workers through reducing quantitative workload, role ambiguity, and interpersonal conflicts. Moreover, specific training programs, job redesign, and formal mentorship that provide employees with improved social skills can also be recommended as soon as early signs of frustration or intentions to misbehave appear. Finally, leadership development practices may help supervisors better manage workplace stressors and reduce the occurrence of workplace aggression. Originality/value – The current study is an initial attempt to look at an integrated model of stress and aggression among blue-collar workers in Tunisia. While some of the findings are consistent with the literature, others might reflect the unique aspects of the Tunisian culture. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The United States healthcare system is being pressured by an aging population, retiring medical work force, and budget constraints. Each year, preventable medical errors cause hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States. Many process improvement tools have been applied to the healthcare industry to improve safety and efficiency. However, nearly all of these tools have neglected to explicitly quantify mental workload of healthcare providers despite the consensus that it is related to human performance. This research effort uses the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT), a discrete-event simulation (DES), to model human performance by quantifying mental workload. This tool has primarily been used to determine manpower and design requirements for military applications. This study takes a unique approach by using IMPRINT to quantitatively model the mental workload demands of healthcare workers. Specifically, this research examines nurses and technicians in an inpatient unit at the Wright-Patterson Medical Center to detect workload differences between staff and identify trends which lead to high workload demands. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

AB  - Introduction: As a result of Industry 5.0’s technological advancements, collaborative robots (cobots) have emerged as pivotal enablers for refining manufacturing processes while re-focusing on humans. However, the successful integration of these cutting-edge tools hinges on a better understanding of human factors when interacting with such new technologies, eventually fostering workers’ trust and acceptance and promoting low-fatigue work. This study thus delves into the intricate dynamics of human-cobot interactions by adopting a human-centric view. Methods: With this intent, we targeted senior workers, who often contend with diminishing work capabilities, and we explored the nexus between various human factors and task outcomes during a joint assembly operation with a cobot on an ergonomic workstation. Exploiting a dual-task manipulation to increase the task demand, we measured performance, subjective perceptions, eye-tracking indices and cardiac activity during the task. Firstly, we provided an overview of the senior workers’ perceptions regarding their shared work with the cobot, by measuring technology acceptance, perceived wellbeing, work experience, and the estimated social impact of this technology in the industrial sector. Secondly, we asked whether the considered human factors varied significantly under dual-tasking, thus responding to a higher mental load while working alongside the cobot. Finally, we explored the predictive power of the collected measurements over the number of errors committed at the work task and the participants’ perceived workload. Results: The present findings demonstrated how senior workers exhibited strong acceptance and positive experiences with our advanced workstation and the cobot, even under higher mental strain. Besides, their task performance suffered increased errors and duration during dual-tasking, while the eye behavior partially reflected the increased mental demand. Some interesting outcomes were also gained about the predictive power of some of the collected indices over the number of errors committed at the assembly task, even though the same did not apply to predicting perceived workload levels. Discussion: Overall, the paper discusses possible applications of these results in the 5.0 manufacturing sector, emphasizing the importance of adopting a holistic human-centered approach to understand the human-cobot complex better.

AB  - Presented is a literature study into the importance of how information in assembly instructions in manual assembly is presented, more specifically how various factors such as the complexity of the assembly itself, the mental and physical workload of the worker, as well as the experience and skill level of the worker affect the requirements for information presentation. The requirements made by Industry 4.0 on flexibility in production lines and an increased number of variants produced causes increased demands on workers, which leads to more cognitive demands being made on assembly workers. Studies exist around assembly instruction modes, but have in many cases ignored factors such as worker skill level, mental workload, and task complexity and how these affect the requirements for information presentation, which is a major contribution of this study. The findings are that no single solution fits all requirements, but that the aforementioned factors should be taken into account. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Construction companies suffer huge losses due to labor fatalities and injuries. Since more than 70% of all accidents are related to human activities, detecting and mitigating human-related risks holds the key to improve the safety condition of construction industry. Many research reveals the psychological and emotional conditions of workers could contribute to the fatalities and injuries. More recent observations in the area of neural science and psychology suggest inattentional blindness is one major cause of unexpected human related accidents. Due to the limitation of human mental workload, labors are vulnerable to unexpected hazards while they are focusing on complicated construction tasks. Therefore, detecting the mental conditions of workers could indicate the hazards level of unexpected injuries. However, there is no available measurement can monitor construction workers' mental condition and related hazards. This proposed research aims at proposing a measurement framework to evaluate such hazards through a neural time-frequency analysis approach. At the same time, the researchers also developed a prototype wearable Electroencephalography (EEG) safety helmet to enable the neural information collection.

AB  - Drones are increasingly being used in the construction industry for numerous applications. However, their presence poses safety risks to construction workers who work around them but have limited control and information about these drones. To ensure safety, general construction workers who are not part of the pilot teams should also be able to communicate their concerns with drones effectively and naturally. Despite its importance, research on human-drone communication within construction for non-operator workers is scarce. This study developed and evaluated communication protocols using gesture and speech modalities to ensure safe human-drone interactions for non-operator workers in construction environments. An immersive VR environment replicating construction site dynamics was developed, enabling workers to utilize gesture or speech communication protocols while working with drones. A total of 100 participants were recruited for the user-centered study analysis on an immersive VR construction site, and the safety implications and cognitive loads of both protocols were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that gesture-based communication is more effective than speech-based communication in mitigating risks and alleviating the negative impacts of drones without imposing additional cognitive strain on users on construction sites. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High-voltage transmission tower construction is a high-risk operation due to the construction site locations, extreme climatic factors, elevated working surfaces, and narrow working space. To comprehensively enhance our understanding of the psychophysiological phenomena of workers in extremely high tower constructions, we carried out a series of field experiments to test and compare three working surface heights in terms of frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. Twelve experienced male workers participated in this experiment. The dependent variables, namely, heart rate (HR), normalized low-frequency power (nLF), normalized high-frequency power (nHF), and LF-to-HF power ratio (LF/HF), were measured with the Polar RS800CX heart rate monitor. The experimental results indicated that the task workload was similar between working surface heights. Tower construction workers perceived an increased level of mental stress as working surface height increased. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - The evolution of the manufacturing sector coupled with advancements in digital twin technology has precipitated the extensive integration of digital twin robotic arms within the industrial domain. Notwithstanding this trend, there exists a paucity of studies examining the interaction of these robotic arms in virtual reality (VR) contexts from the user’s standpoint. This paper delves into the virtual interaction of digital twin robotic arms by concentrating on effective guidance methodologies for the input of their target motion trajectories. Such a focus is pivotal to optimize input precision and efficiency, thus contributing to research on the virtual interaction interfaces of these robotic arms. During empirical evaluations, metrics related to human–machine interaction, such as objective operational efficiency, precision, and subjective workload, were meticulously quantified. Moreover, the influence of disparate guidance methods on the interaction experience of digital twin robotic arms and their corresponding scenarios was investigated. Consequent findings offer pivotal insights regarding the efficacy of these guidance methods across various scenarios, thereby serving as an invaluable guide for future endeavors aiming to bolster interactive experiences in devices akin to digital twin robotic arms. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The migration from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 is becoming more relevant nowadays, with a consequent increase in interest in the operators’ wellness in their working environment. In modern industry, there are different activities that require the flexibility of human operators in performing different tasks, while some others can be performed by collaborative robots (cobots), which promote a fair division of the tasks among the resources in industrial applications. Initially, these robots were used to increase productivity, in particular in assembly systems; currently, new goals have been introduced, such as reducing operator’s fatigue, so that he/she can be more effective in the tasks that require his/her flexibility. For this purpose, a model that aims to realize a multi-objective optimization for task allocation is here proposed. It includes makespan minimization, but also the operator’s energy expenditure and average mental workload reduction. The first objective is to reach the required high productivity standards, while the latter is to realize a human-centered workplace, as required by the Industry 5.0 paradigms. A method for average mental workload evaluation in the entire assembly process and a new constraint, related to resources’ idleness, are here suggested, together with the evaluation of the methodology in a real case study. The results show that it is possible to combine all these elements finding a procedure to define the optimal task allocation that improves the performance of the systems, both for efficiency and for workers’ well-being. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - In smart manufacturing environments robots collaborate with human operators as peers. They even share the same working space and time. An intuitive interaction with different input modalities is decisive to reduce workload and training periods for collaboration. We introduce our interaction system that is able to recognize gestures, actions and objects in a typical smart working scenario. As key aspect, this article considers an empirical investigation of input modalities (touch, gesture), individual differences (performance, Recognition rate, previous knowledge) and boundary conditions (level of automation) on user experience. Therefore, answers from 31 participants within two experiments are collected. We show that the arrangement of the human-robot collaboration (input modalities, boundary conditions) has a significant effect on user experience in real-world environments. This effect and the individual differences between participants can be measured utilizing Recognition rates and standardized usability questionnaires. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, the customers are increasingly demanding, pushing the companies to offer highly diversified products. This requires different kinds of products be manufactured in intermixed product sequences on the same line. Such assembly lines are called the mixed-model assembly lines (MMAL). Workers and machinery have to be flexible to reduce the setup times and costs. A good vehicle sequence in MMAL can have many positive effects on MMAL: It can permit producing more products in a shorter time period (providing cost reductions) and can also improve the work conditions by balancing the workload of the operators. In this article, we are interested in the sequencing of a mixed model assembly line for Truck Industry. In the literature, different objectives exist to solve the MMAL sequencing problem. From the analysis of the industrial case an original problem is derived. In this article, we present new efficient methods to minimize the total work overload. In a previous work, a linear programming (LP) approach has been proposed for this problem. The MMAL is known to be an NP-hard problem. The exact methods such as LP can only handle small problems and their applications are limited in an industrial context. Therefore, we present here solutions based meta-heuristics. Three types of meta-heuristic algorithms are used in this research: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and finally a hybrid method based on both Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing (GASA). Numerical tests are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed algorithms. For small instances, a benchmark data from the literature is used to compare the performance of the meta-heuristics versus the optimal solution found by the LP approach, based on the computational time and the quality of the solutions. The comparisons are also made for larger instances, for some generated data and the data from an industrial case study.

AB  - As a worker-centred assembly mode developed in the electronics industry in Japan, seru is receiving growing attention due to improved flexibility and responsiveness. In seru implementation, cross-trained worker assignment is a vital problem. Most previous studies focused on assigning cross-trained workers into pure divisional or rotating seru separately, but overlooked the problem for a hybrid seru production system that includes both seru types. This research fills this gap by minimizing the makespan and balancing the workers’ workload of each seru in a bi-objective mathematical model. For medium-scale instances, the exact solutions are obtained. For large-scale instances, we propose an NSGA-II-based memetic algorithm that uses two-level encoding and incorporates the bat algorithm as a local search and two K-means-based NSGA-II algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that the K-means-based NSGA-II not only outperforms other algorithms with respect to common proximity and diversity metrics but also runs an order of magnitude faster (in seconds versus minutes required by others on the same computer). Some management insights are obtained based on many numerical experiments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - After the Fukushima Daiichi accident, nuclear regulators around the world have required that power reactor licensees develop more extensive emergency mitigating responses and severe accident management provisions beyond the defense-in-depth measures for design basis accidents (DBAs), previously in place. Workload assessments represent common validation techniques that are used to demonstrate that workers are able to perform tasks without unacceptable performance degradation. High workload is known to induced stress and fatigue and may severely diminish a worker's capacity to perceive, recognize, and respond appropriately during emergency or unanticipated events, which may result in undesirable consequences. In estimating workload during emergency and severe accident scenarios, power reactor licensees tend to rely on subjective measures of workload, such as NASA-TLX. Due to reported mismatches in the literature between subjective and physiologically-derived estimates of workload, it is prudent to see what more can be done to improve the current state of practice, in the context of emergency and severe accident conditions. To improve confidence in workload estimates, it is advocated that the nuclear industry integrate physiological-based measures into current practices by making use of 'on-body' or 'wearable' physiological sensors. In this paper, an overview of three different types of empirical workload approaches is provided. The advantages of wearable physiological sensors are considered in the context of extreme environments and occupations, with tangible examples including heat stress and pupillometry. Suggestions for a consensus forum on workload are provided and a research plan directed at improving the current practice of workload estimation is offered for consideration. © 2017 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.

AB  - Wearable sensors are currently being used to manage fatigue in professional athletics, transportation and mining industries. In manufacturing, physical fatigue is a challenging ergonomic/safety “issue” since it lowers productivity and increases the incidence of accidents. Therefore, physical fatigue must be managed. There are two main goals for this study. First, we examine the use of wearable sensors to detect physical fatigue occurrence in simulated manufacturing tasks. The second goal is to estimate the physical fatigue level over time. In order to achieve these goals, sensory data were recorded for eight healthy participants. Penalized logistic and multiple linear regression models were used for physical fatigue detection and level estimation, respectively. Important features from the five sensors locations were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), a popular variable selection methodology. The results show that the LASSO model performed well for both physical fatigue detection and modeling. The modeling approach is not participant and/or workload regime specific and thus can be adopted for other applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We solve the type-2 assembly line balancing problem in the presence of sequencedependent setup times, denoted SUALBP-2. The problem consists of a set of tasks of a product, requiring to be processed in different assembly stations. Each task has a definite processing and setup times. The magnitude of setup times for each task is dependent on the processing sequence within each station. Processing and setup times of tasks assigned to each station constitute the station time. The goal is to minimize the cycle time (the maximum station time) by optimally (i) assigning tasks to assembly stations and (ii) sequencing these tasks within each station. To solve this challenging optimization problem, we first improve upon an existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) model by our proposed lower and upper bounds. These enhancements reduce theMIP model's (solved CPLEX) average optimality gap from 41.61% to 20.77% on extra-large instances of the problem. To further overcome the intractability of the MIP model, we develop an exact logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) algorithm. The LBBD algorithm effectively incorporates a novel two-phase solution approach, the lower and upper bounds, various preprocessing techniques, relaxations, and valid inequalities. Using existing benchmarks in the literature, we demonstrate that our LBBD algorithm finds integer feasible solutions for 100% of all 788 instances (64% for theMIP), verifies optimality for 47% of instances (37% for the MIP), and achieves an average optimality gap of 5.04%(7.72% for the MIP obtained over 64% solved small instances). The LBBD algorithm also significantly reduces the computational time required to solve these benchmarks. Summary of Contribution: Assembly line balancing plays a crucial role in productivity enhancement in manufacturing and service companies. A balanced assembly line ensures higher throughput rate and fairer distribution of workload among assembly stations (workers). Assembly line balancing, in its simplest form, is one of the most challenging combinatorial optimization problems. Its complexity is further intensified when the sequence of executing tasks assigned to each station influences the magnitude of the setup performed between any two successive tasks. In view of such complexity, most assembly line balancing problems have been solved by randomized search techniques that do not provide any guarantee on the quality of solutions found. The mission of this paper is to understand whether there is any special structure within the existingmathematicalmodels in the literature and, if so, exploit them toward developing computationally efficient exact techniques that can provide guarantee on the quality of solutions. Indeed, we demonstrate that such a special mathematical structure exists and we thus develop the first decomposition technique in form of a logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) to efficiently solve the type-2 sequence-dependent assembly line balancing problem. Specifically, we show that our LBBD significantly reduces cycle time and the time required for decision making. Our LBBD generalizes the scope of exact techniques for decision-making beyond the assembly line problems and is extendable to many other shop scheduling problems that arrange their stations (machines) serially and there are sequence-dependent setup times among their tasks.  © 2021 INFORMS.

AB  - Manufacturing enhancement is a core strategy to obtain manufacturing excellence and is necessary to obtain a good financial and operational performance of small and medium scale manufacturing industries. Lean engineering tools help in reducing unwanted wastes and cycle times and also in identifying the proper alternative layout in the industry. The objective of this research is to study and identify the time taken and bottleneck stations for manufacturing the product. The bottleneck process has been addressed using line balancing which includes work load leveling. The line balancing results by distributing the workload and the result has been reached to 97% effective use of workers. 5S auditing and implementation was carried out for effective housekeeping and the scores before and after implementations were 2.54 and 3.54 respectively. The layout of the industry was analyzed and found that the current layout has more unwanted transportation, improper communication between necessary departments, and more cycle time for producing a product. The layout has been optimized and the best alternative was selected. From the simulation study, it inferred that the total cycle time was reduced by about 155 minutes and the value added time was reduced from 534 to 378 minutes. © 2021 Totem Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Fall from heights accidents are one of the most frequent causes of death in the construction industry. Many fall-from-height accidents are related to stability issues and stability is critical for construction workers working at heights. Thus, stability monitoring of workers is important for proactive accident prevention. However, workers’ stability is highly personalized due to differences in workers’ physical characteristics and habits. Little attention has been paid to the personalized posture-based stability analysis of workers working at heights. This study proposes a personalized stability monitoring framework based on workers' body posture patterns when working at heights. The proposed method includes two main components: posture recognition and stability monitoring. First, OpenPose is used to extract the coordinates of workers’ posture key points from video clips. Two posture features, duration and count, are extracted to reflect workload and frequency. Secondly, a two-stage stability monitoring framework, including instability detection and instability evaluation, is designed based on the Gaussian model and Gaussian mixture model. Finally, the proposed framework is validated by on-site construction videos of workers working at height. The validation results showed the accuracy of 84.38% and the precision of 81.25% in identifying the stable status of a subject. The robustness of the personalised monitoring method was validated through comparisons with five other workers. The study provides a practical reference for active safety monitoring for workers with high fall-from-height risk. It also helps to extend personalized and adaptive behaviour-based safety training for construction workers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The equipment manufacturing industry needs skilled workers to operate a specific set of machines following process specifications. Optimizing machine and worker assignments to achieve maximum efficiency is a critical problem for workshop managers. This paper investigates a multi-objective dual-resource-constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem. An improved wild horse optimization (IWHO) algorithm is developed to simultaneously optimize three objectives: makespan, maximum machine workload, and total machine workload. To evaluate the quality of individuals in multi-objective optimization, the Pareto fast non-dominated sorting method is used, and the crowding distance is calculated. To update the algorithm's solution, the crossover and mutation operations are used. Further, a local neighborhood search strategy is employed to enhance searchability and avoid trapping into the local optima. The benchmark of the flexible job shop scheduling problem is extended to create test instances, and the performance of the suggested IWHO algorithm is evaluated compared with the NSGA-II. The computational results show that the IWHO algorithm provides a non-dominated efficient set within a reasonable running time. Furthermore, a buffers and chain coupler assembly process is designed to analyze the practical value of the IWHO algorithm. The proposed solutions can be used to generate daily schedules for managing machines, workers, and production cycles. © 2023 Production Engineering Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - As robot algorithms for manipulation and navigation advance and robot hardware is becoming more robust and readily available, industry demands robots to perf orm more sophisticated tasks in our homes and fact ories. For many years, direct teleoperation was the most common and traditional form of control for robots. However, due to the complexity of robot motion, human operators must focus most of their attention on solving low-level motion control which leads to their heighte ned cognitive load. In this abstract, we propose a goal- directed approach to programming robots by providing a tool to model the world and provide goal states foe a given task. Operators will be able to set the initial pos itions of objects and their afTordances along with their goal positions by imposing three dimensional (3D) temp lates on point clouds. Robots will solve the given task using the combination of task and motion planning algorithms. Copyright © 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Among the key technologies of Industry 4.0, Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the most promising and enabling technologies for supporting factory workers and engineers at the workplace. To this end, the paper proposes a novel AR tool to assist operators during the inspection activities for the detection of production and assembly errors. In fact, thanks to the superimposition of the 3D models, as designed by the technical office, a worker can easily detect the presence of design discrepancies on the final physical assembled product and report them by adding 3D annotations directly on virtual models. This AR tool has been developed by using ARCore™ libraries to ensure, in the first place, its compatibility with commonly used devices for which workers are already trained and, secondly, to take advantage of the hybrid-tracking techniques that combine vision- and sensor-based methods to improve the reliability of the AR visualization. Nevertheless, the proposed AR tool adopts multiple markers to minimize tracking errors and therefore to provide greater freedom of movement to the user, who can use the tool also for the assessment of large-size products. Field experimentations have been carried out on a real case study with end-users in order to assess its usability and perceived mental workload through the SUS (System Usability Scale) and NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) standard questionnaires, respectively. The usability study was performed taking into account also objective metrics, i.e., by analysing user performance in target acquisition tasks while interacting with the AR tool. Statistical analysis proved that the adoption of this AR tool requires low mental demand, and its usability has reached a high level of satisfaction both by the factory workers and engineers involved in the user study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) solutions are emerging in multiple scenarios of application as Industry 4.0 takes shape. In particular, for remote collaboration, flexible mechanisms such as authoring tools can be used to generate instructions and assist human operators as they experience increased complexity in their daily tasks. In addition to the traditional handicap of ensuring instructions can be intuitively created without having to understand complicated AR concepts, another relevant topic is the fact that the quality of said instructions is not properly analyzed prior to the tools being evaluated. This means that the characteristics of the visual content are not adequately assessed beforehand. Hence, it is essential to be aware of the cognitive workload associated with AR instructions to assert if they can be easily understood and accepted before being deployed in real-world scenarios. To address this, we focused on AR during sessions of remote guidance. Based on a participatory process with domain experts from the industry sector, a prototype for creating AR-based instructions was developed, and a user study with two parts was conducted: (1) first, a set of step-by-step instructions was produced, and their visual characteristics were evaluated by 129 participants based on a set of relevant dimensions; (2) afterward, these instructions were used by nine participants to understand if they could be used to assist on-site collaborators during real-life remote maintenance tasks. The results suggest that the AR instructions offer low visual complexity and considerable visual impact, clarity, and directed focus, thus improving situational understanding and promoting task resolution. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The factory of the future requires flexibility and adaptability to satisfy market demands. However, these properties are difficult to ensure when collaborative manipulators are considered. Thus, approaches for integrating these devices, fostering the adoption of new engineering methodologies for augmenting manipulators are studied. In this work we address how integration of human operators with robotic manipulators might accommodate flexibility requirements using a concept of lean automation. To answer this question, we compare the current research in the field, and we propose a design structure which addresses safety, interfaces and design methods. Our results show safety hardware posing considerable constraints on flexibility. The human interface influences the workload perceived by an operator and, Industrie 4.0 reference architectures do not foresee the human and reconfigurable production cells yet. From a design prospective, this study emphasizes the need to take into consideration human and engineering aspects while planning for the factory of the future. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Despite the increased interest in automation and the expanded deployment of robots in the construction industry, using robots in a dynamic and unstructured working environment has caused safety concerns in operating construction robots. Improving human-robot interaction (HRI) can increase the adoption of robots on construction sites; for example, increasing trust in robots could help construction workers to accept new technologies. Confidence in operation (or self-efficacy), mental workload, and situational awareness are among other key factors that help such workers to remote operate robots safely. However, construction workers have very few opportunities to practice with robots to build trust, self-efficacy, and situational awareness, as well as resistance against increasing mental workload, before interacting with them on job sites. Virtual reality (VR) could afford a safer place to practice with the robot; thus, we tested if VR-based training could improve these four outcomes during the remote operation of construction robots. We measured trust in the robot, self-efficacy, mental workload, and situational awareness in an experimental study where construction workers remote-operated a demolition robot. Fifty workers were randomly assigned to either VR-based training or traditional in-person training led by an expert trainer. Results show that VR-based training significantly increased trust in the robot, self-efficacy, and situational awareness, compared to traditional in-person training. Our findings suggest that VR-based training can allow for significant increases in beneficial cognitive factors over more traditional methods and has substantial implications for improving HRI using VR, especially in the construction industry.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Evaluation of workplace ergonomics for office workers is significant for occupational health. Since office employees' work is often mental, this evaluation should include a mental workload assessment as well as a physical assessment. The purpose of this study is to examine the physical and mental workload of office workers of an automotive supplier company. This study was carried out on 250 office workers. The musculoskeletal and physical risks were investigated using Rapid Office Strain Assessment (ROSA) and Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ), and the mental workload was analyzed with NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Musculoskeletal disorder risk and mental workload levels were revealed by statistical analysis and examined on the basis of departments. The correlations between risk levels obtained by different methods and the effect of gender and age factors were also investigated. ROSA final score average was 3.69 which corresponds to a moderate risk level. 62.4% of the employees for the chair section and 64.4% of them for the keyboard and mouse section were at moderate and above risk levels. According to the CMDQ results, the body regions with the most discomfort were determined as the neck, upper back, lower back and right wrist. NASA-TLX scores showed that the highest mental workload occurs in office workers in Accounting, Maintenance and Purchasing departments. NASA-TLX scores were found to be correlated with the ROSA final score, but not with the CMDQ scores. Evaluating the musculoskeletal disorder risks and mental workload of office workers together and taking the necessary precautions were beneficial in terms of protecting the health of the employees. © 2024 Yildiz Technical University.

AB  - Workers in a construction site may be exposed various hazards and risks and may work with excessive demands beyond their physical abilities. It is important for construction companies to sustain a workforce in the work environment that does not sacrifice worker safety and health and maintains the required productivity. The purpose of this study was to develop a method for real-time estimation of the workload risk of individual workers at a construction site. Based on previous studies, we developed a workload model that includes behavioral information and physical characteristics of workers in addition to heart rate reserve (%HRR). Recent wearable devices have sufficient performance for measuring biological and physical load data without interfering from their work. In this case study, heart rate and physical activity were measured using smart wear equipped with a biosensor, an acceleration sensor and IoT system developed in our research. Using a logistic regression analysis as the statistical methods and SPSS as the analysis tool, we analyzed the risk caused by the workload. As a result, it became clear that the physical activity and the heart rate will be the important parameters for estimating workload risk in construction works. However, worker age and body mass index (BMI) did not have a significant effect on estimating workload risk. In the construction site, types of works and skills of workers will change according to the progress of the project. In order to ensure a stable workforce and productivity, it is necessary for construction industry to manage workers' health and safety. In conclusion of this paper, we propose that the real-time monitoring of heart rate and physical activity during construction work can be used for human resource management (HRM). With the development of this study, it will be possible to determine how the workers' workload affects productivity. It is believed that this research will be useful as an element of the integrated management technology of the entire construction site using ICT tools. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

AB  - Introduction: Quality of work-life (QWL) is an essential concept related to the life of a worker. QWL is made to realize the balance between the workers' needs and interests, as well as the workload to ensure work satisfaction and the organization's productivity. PT Semen Indonesia is the biggest cement producing company in Java Island. The company manages the human resources to achieve job satisfaction by carrying out the QWL program. This research aims to analyze the factors related to the QWL that can lead to the workers' QWL, especially to the packers and loader workers at PT Semen Indonesia, Tuban Factory. Methods: This research is completed by implementing the cross-sectional design with a qualitative approach. The population of this research is all workers in the packer and loader department Tuban IVth plant, as many as 80 people, while the sample consists of 45 workers chosen by the simple random sampling method. Seven identified factors from the literature review are the workers' involvement, balanced compensations, a sense of security towards the work, occupational safety and health, career development, working relationships, and pride in the company. Results: indicate that there is a significant and positive correlation between all seven factors and the QWL. Conclusioan: That developing a non-financial compensation, socializing career development programs, and job guarantee will lead to job satisfaction as well as to ensure the organization's productivity. © 2019 IJOSH AU right reserved.

AB  - Analysis of the number of workers in a company is very important. This is very necessary to determine the optimal number of workers. This research has been done in a company engaged for processing single and compound fertilizers. The company trades fertilizer as its first business which is a subsidiary one of the largest agribusiness company in Indonesia. In this study an analysis of the needs of the number of workers was carried out based on the job description of each worker at packaging station. Thus, the workload is calculated for each worker at the packaging station using the Work Load Analysis (WLA) method to calculate the percentage of productivity using the Work Sampling method. Next, the determination of the Rating Factor value using the Westinghouse method and determining the value of Allowance using the Industrial Labour Organization (ILO) table. The workload calculation results obtained that the workload received by 5 operators is high because the value is above 100%. The proposed improvement recommendations given related to the high workload condition is by adding 2 more workers so that the number of workers recommended at packaging station is 7 workers. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In the Industry 5.0 framework, due to the close collaboration between humans and robots, providing a safe environment and balance workload becomes an essential requirement. In this context, evaluating the trustworthiness of robots from a human-centric perspective is essential as trust impacts the interaction in human-robot collaborations. Numerous researchers in the literature have delved into physiological responses as indicators of user trust in robots. In this research endeavor, multiple machine learning models were employed, leveraging skin conductance response (SCR) to classify the trust level of the human operator. A chemical industry scenario was developed, where a collaborative robot supported a human operator by handing over a beaker used for the pouring of chemicals. The machine learning models achieved a moderate accuracy rate of 68.99% and AUC of 0.73 for the hand-over task. Nonetheless, this study underscores the importance of sensor fusion techniques to improve the accuracy of trust assessment within the context of human-robot collaborations.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The construction industry is one of the most dangerous work environments, since it is characterized by numerous physical and psycho-social risk factors. Nevertheless, only a few studies have been conducted to analyze workers’ well-being within this sector. Drawing on the Job Demands-Resources model, this study aimed to investigate whether job resources (i.e. job control and supervisor support) could independently buffer the relationship between job demands (i.e. workload, emotional demands and work pace) and psycho-physical health among alpine transit tunnel construction employees. 96 workers employed in an Italian construction company filled in anonymous self-report questionnaires investigating: job demands, job resources and psycho-physical health. Descriptive analyses, analyses of variance and structural equation models were carried out. Workers who perceived higher job control and supervisor support were less likely to experience psycho-physical malaise, even in presence of high workload and work pace. Fostering job resources is crucial to design interventions aimed at maintaining or improving construction workers’ well-being. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A multi-agent iterative optimisation method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed for the balancing and sequencing problem in mixed model assembly lines. Based on the Markov decision process model for balancing and sequencing, a balancing agent using a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, a sequencing agent using an Actor–Critic algorithm, as well as an iterative interaction mechanism between these agents' output solutions are designed for realising the global optimisation of mixed model assembly lines. The exchange of solution information including assembly time and station workload in the iterative interaction realises the coordination of the worker assignment policy at the balancing stage and the production arrangement policy at the sequencing stage for the minimisation of work overload and idle time at stations. Through the comparative experiments with heuristic rules, genetic algorithms, and the original deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated and discussed for small-scale instances as well as large-scale ones. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In the Firework industries, workers are affected by muscle, nerve, spinal cord, leg pain, or ligament injuries depending on the work nature and work pressure. During the festival or seasonal times, workers are forced to complete their tasks. For that period, supervisors and managers are likely to add to some tasks or increase their workload. They must work for longer durations and use excess hand and arm muscles, resulting in poor body posture. Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) develops, as a result, causing pain and discomfort. But this may expose workers to workplace musculoskeletal conditions that lead to health complications and financial losses if endured over time. The current study objective is to find musculoskeletal disorder issues among the firework industry employees. Use the KNN rule to analyze the connection between musculoskeletal pain issues and risk factors, as well as work postures. The model will classify the poses supported that predicting the kind of disorder with accuracy and effectiveness. The results is used as a decision support tool to prioritize resources that can reduce ergonomic risk. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Today manufacturing enterprises aim not only to deliver high-value, cost-effectively products in a sustainable way, but also to consider the quality of the working environments. The analysis of human factors, which strongly affect time and quality of manufacturing processes, are crucial for satisfying people involved in the manufacturing process and making them safe, preventing diseases, errors and excessive workload. The paper presents a structured procedure to automatically extract data from virtual analysis made by digital manufacturing tools and measure a set of indicators to validly assess manufacturing ergonomics. The research considers the state of the art in manufacturing ergonomics and defines a set of indicators suitable for manufacturing manual operations, focusing on assembly tasks. Furthermore, it defines a methodology to automatically extract data valorising the selected indicators and an application, based on Visual Basic, to generate the specific task list and related assessment. The result is a rapid and objective assessment, independent from the experience of the user, which can be executed during process design. The procedure has been applied to an industrial case study, where the manual assembly of cabin supports on the tractor chassis has been analysed in order to correct the most uncomfortable steps and obtain a more ergonomic process. A decrease of the EAWS score, calculated with the proposed method, allowed to validate the proposed solution, suggesting a redesign of the assembly cycle to improve the working conditions. Such a procedure anticipates the analysis of the workers' wellbeing during the design stage to support the definition of human-centric manufacturing processes, simplifying and accelerating the assessment activities. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Physical exertion undoubtedly influences physiological parameters. The aim of this paper is to propose a Machine Learning classifier able to evaluate the physical state of subjects monitored through a wearable device, by simply analysing their Blood Volume Pulse signals. Moreover, a Fatigue-Related Index is presented to quantify the physical well-being status. Results show that the Support Vector Machine classifier provides the best performance for detecting fatigue-induced stress, since it shows an accuracy of 97.50%. The obtained results prove that the proposed approach allows to support the assessment of the worker's well-being status, with the aim of improving the workload management in the context of Industry 4.0. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The costs of work-related mental health place a considerable burden on employees, organisations, and communities; effective, evidence-based interventions addressing this issue are urgently needed. The influence of the work environment, particularly psychosocial hazards, on employees’ mental and physical health and safety is well-established within the broader health and wellbeing literature and is increasingly being recognised as an important issue within the Building and Construction Industry (BCI). In particular, the role of supervisors in shaping work conditions that contribute to, or ameliorate, psychosocial hazards has been emphasised in BCI contexts. While the quality of supervisor-worker relationships are important in their own right, there are a multitude of ways in which supervisors exert influence on the work environment that extend beyond the dynamics of the dyadic relationships, including clarifying role expectations and allocating resources to balance workloads. The dearth of valid and reliable measures to assess aspects of the work environment that influence (and are influenced by) the quality of supervisor-worker relationships is a critical barrier to implementing effective mental health interventions in the workplace. This research presents a two-part study outlining the development and validation of an 11-dimension measure of work characteristics, which are influenced by supervisor-worker relationships, for use in BCI contexts. Study 1A outlines the iterative approach taken to assess the suitability of existing published measures for adaptation within the BCI, employing interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders. This approach resulted in a preliminary People at Work – Construction (PAW-CON) pilot measure of 44-items. In Study 1B, the validity and reliability of the PAW-CON was assessed via a quantitative survey completed by 406 Australian BCI employees. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a final 36-item measure consisting of 11 aspects of work directly relevant to supervisor-worker relationships. These findings support using the PAW-CON measure in academic and applied BCI settings. © 2024

AB  - This article presents the Network Empower and Prototyping Platform (NEP+), a flexible framework purposefully crafted to simplify the process of interactive application development, catering to both technical and non-technical users. The name "NEP+" encapsulates the platform’s dual mission: to empower the network-related capabilities of ZeroMQ and to provide software tools and interfaces for prototyping and integration. NEP+ accomplishes this through a comprehensive quality model and an integrated software ecosystem encompassing middleware, user-friendly graphical interfaces, a command-line tool, and an accessible end-user programming interface. This article primarily focuses on presenting the proposed quality model and software architecture, illustrating how they can empower developers to craft cross-platform, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces for various applications, with a particular emphasis on robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, we provide practical insights into the applicability of NEP+ by briefly presenting real-world user cases where human-centered projects have successfully utilized NEP+ to develop robotics systems. To further emphasize the suitability of NEP+ tools and interfaces for developer use, we conduct a pilot study that delves into usability and workload assessment. The outcomes of this study highlight the user-friendly features of NEP+ tools, along with their ease of adoption and cross-platform capabilities. The novelty of NEP+ fundamentally lies in its holistic approach, acting as a bridge across diverse user groups, fostering inclusivity, and promoting collaboration. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Frontline workers who offered essential services in different industries during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic faced enormous challenges. This study presents the outcome of a survey that investigates employees’ sentiments, perceptions, and ergonomics in early childhood education while weathering the pandemic storms during in-person opening amidst the global health crisis. The results show that employees faced increased workload, psychological burden, and heightened uncertainty about health and social life as the pandemic raged. The teaching and non-teaching staff attributed the increased workload to additional paperwork requirements and worker shortages due to quarantine and self-isolation. Public health safety became a priority at the preschool to keep the students, staff, and their families safe. Despite the uncertain future, employees were resolute about career choices in early childhood education. The ‘family advocacy’ services, a unit that liaises with families to improve kids’ learning outcomes, utilized virtual communication technology during the pandemic (e.g. Zoom and Microsoft Teams) to limit physical contact, which produced positive results, including significant improvement in productivity, performance efficiency, and quality. Most workers remained hopeful about overcoming the prevailing workplace challenges caused by the pandemic. © 2024 EECERA.

AB  - Industry 5.0 aims to prioritize human operators, focusing on their well-being and capabilities, while promoting collaboration between humans and robots to enhance efficiency and productivity. The integration of collaborative robots must ensure the health and well-being of human operators. Indeed, this paper addresses the need for a human-centered framework proposing a preference-based optimization algorithm in a human–robot collaboration (HRC) scenario with an ergonomics assessment to improve working conditions. The HRC application consists of optimizing a collaborative robot end-effector pose during an object-handling task. The following approach (AmPL-RULA) utilizes an Active multi-Preference Learning (AmPL) algorithm, a preference-based optimization method, where the user is requested to iteratively provide qualitative feedback by expressing pairwise preferences between a couple of candidates. To address physical well-being, an ergonomic performance index, Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), is combined with the user's pairwise preferences, so that the optimal setting can be computed. Experimental tests have been conducted to validate the method, involving collaborative assembly during the object handling performed by the robot. Results illustrate that the proposed method can improve the physical workload of the operator while easing the collaborative task. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective: To assess uncertainty in cost estimates for collecting posture data by inclinometry, observations and self-report. Method: In a study addressing physical workloads at a paper mill, costs were calculated for measuring postures of twenty-eight workers during three shifts. Uncertainty in costs was assessed for all three methods as the range between an assumed best case (lowest cost) and worst case (highest cost) using scenario analysis. Results: The cost for observation was larger, but also more uncertain (€16506 and €89552 in the best and worst case, respectively) than that of inclinometry (€7613 - €45896). Self-report costs were both lower and less uncertain (€3743 - €23368). Conclusions: The extent of uncertainty in cost estimates implies that observation could be less expensive than inclinometry, e.g., in a scenario where experienced observers could use existing software, while inclinometers would have to be purchased. We propose adding uncertainty assessments to cost estimates when selecting a method for measuring working postures, and offer guidance in how to proceed in a specific setting. © 2018

The employee performance and productivity are affected by many factors related on one hand to the line efficiency and, on the other hand, to the well-being of the workers. On the basis of new technologies and driven by Industry 4.0 paradigms, the need of a high production rate cannot neglect the safeguarding of the workers. In case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), that can be reduced by applying ergonomics principles both in design (e.g. workstation design, equipment tools identification, etc.) and in operative phases (e.g. workload balance, tasks assignment, etc.). In the operative phase, job rotation is one of the most widespread methods for alleviating physical fatigue and reducing the stress due to repetitive tasks. However, often, job rotation strategies fail due to the lack of systematic approach or effective management of rotation schedules, being very difficult to identify an effective job rotation schedule allowing maintaining the same productivity rate. The problem is of particular interest under the perspective of the workforce aging, a social European phenomenon which is also affecting production systems performance. Designing and scheduling of human-based assembly systems require a joint evaluation of production system performance and a good balancing of MSDs risk among workers. The authors proposed a model for minimizing the exposure risk of workers involved in repetitive manual tasks, by balancing the human workloads and reducing the ergonomic risk within acceptable limits, for a given production target. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the RULA method, according to a mixed integer programming approach. Results shown the effectiveness of the model to identify the optimal job rotation schedules jointly achieving productivity and ergonomic risk goals. © 2018, University of Novi Sad.; U današnjem ekonomskom kontekstu radna snaga je ključno sredstvo u proizvodnoj industriji. Na performanse i produktivnost zaposlenih utiču mnogi faktori vezani za efikasnost linije i dobrobit radnika. Na osnovu novih tehnologija i pod uticajem paradigme Industrije 4.0, potreba za visokom proizvodnom stopom ne može zanemariti zaštitu radnika. U slučaju ponavljajucih manuelnih zadataka, radnici su izloženi riziku od poremecaja mišićno-skeletnih organa (MSO), koji se mogu smanjiti primenom principa ergonomije kako udizajnu (npr. Dizajn radne stanice, identifikacija alata opreme, itd.), tako i u operativnim fazama (npr. balansiranje, dodeljivanje zadataka itd.). U operativnoj fazi, rotacija posla je jedna od najrasprostranjenijih metoda za ublažavanje fizičkog zamora i smanjenje stresa zbog ponavljajućih zadataka. Medutim, često strategije rotacije posla ne uspevaju zbog nedostatka sistematskog pristupa ili efikasnog upravljanja rokovima rotiranja, teško je identifikovati efikasan raspored rotacije posla koji omogucava održavanje iste stope produktivnosti. Problem je od posebnog interesa iz perspektive starenja radne snage, društvenog evropskog fenomena koji takode utiče na performanse proizvodnih sistema. Projektovanje i rasporedivanje sistema za montažu zasnovanih na ljudima zahteva zajednicku procenu performansi proizvodnog sistema i dobro uravnoteženje rizika MSO kod radnika. Autori su predložili model za minimiziranje rizika izloženosti radnika koji su ukljuceni u ponavljajuce manuelne zadatke, balansiranjem ljudskih radnih opterećenja i smanjivanjem ergonomskog rizika u prihvatljivim granicama, za odredeni proizvodni cilj. Rizik i njegova prihvatljivost se procenjuju korišćenjem RULA metode, u skladu sa pristupom kombinovanog integrisanog programiranja. Rezultati pokazuju efektivnost modela kako bi se identifikovali optimalni raspored rotacije posla koji zajednički ostvaruju produktivnost i ergonomske ciljeve rizika. © 2018, University of Novi Sad.

AB  - The use of collaborative robots in the manufacturing industry has widely spread in the last decade. In order to be efficient, the human-robot collaboration needs to be properly designed by also taking into account the operator’s psychophysiological reactions. Virtual Reality can be used as a tool to simulate human-robot collaboration in a safe and cheap way. Here, we present a virtual collaborative platform in which the human operator and a simulated robot coordinate their actions to accomplish a simple assembly task. In this study, the robot moved slowly or more quickly in order to assess the effect of its velocity on the human's responses. Ten participants tested this application by using an Oculus Rift head-mounted display; ARTracking cameras and a Kinect system were used to track the operator's right arm movements and hand gestures respectively. Performance, user experience, and physiological responses were recorded. The results showed that while humans’ performances and evaluations varied as a function of the robot’s velocity, no differences were found in the physiological responses. Taken together, these data highlight the relevance of the kinematic aspects of robot’s motion within a human-robot collaboration and provide valuable insights to further develop our virtual human-machine interactive platform.

AB  - The health service industry is required to improve its performance and service to the society continuously. Improvements in performance and service can be done by improving health workers' performance, one example of which is improving the performance of medical trainees. Medical trainees are required to be able to serve patients well, timely and on target for 24 hours, hence scheduling is needed. Medical trainees scheduling in this case is to allocate 179 medical trainees divided into 26 groups, followed by scheduling it into 16 units/clinics/hospital departments for 2 years (96 weeks). Each hospital department has criteria for mental workload, physical workload, fatigue level, group capacity and different duration of time. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling that takes the whole thing into account. Scheduling in this case is still conducted by plotting medical trainees manually and has not considered ergonomic factors (the physical workload, mental workload and fatigue level) at each hospital department. Medical trainees scheduling considering ergonomic factors can be adopted to reduce ergonomic risks and achieve better performance of medical trainees. In this paper, the authors propose an integer nonlinear programming which aims to find optimal scheduling to minimize the deviation in mental workload, physical workload and fatigue level that ware experienced by medical trainees in every month. The mental workload, physical workload and fatigue level were evaluated using the NASA TLX method, pulse rate recall questionnaire and Subjective Self Rating Test (SSRT). Optimal scheduling is needed to reduce the fatigue felt by medical trainees during 96 weeks of clinical clerkship. The results revealed the effectiveness of the model because the scheduling in each department was proven to be done in according to the capacity and time vulnerability based on the regulations and could create a balance of physical workload, mental workload and fatigue level of medical trainees on a monthly basis. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Lean and ergonomics are two disciplines that shared common goals to improve manufacturing production systems. However, there are limited studies that specifically link ergonomics with Lean’s 3 M concept of Muda (waste), Muri (overburden), and Mura (inconsistency). The study employed semi-structured interview with 10 experienced practitioners on past lean projects to establish potential linkage between ergonomics and Lean’s 3 M. A conceptual framework integrating ergonomics components into the Lean’s 3 M components was then generated through group discussion, and validated using Fuzzy Delphi Method analysis. The interviews revealed four themes linking ergonomics to Lean’s 3 M: (1) Human energy waste, (2) Uneven workload distribution, (3) Overburden of worker’s capacity, and (4) Worker performance affects work performance. A conceptual framework integrating ergonomics components into the Lean’s 3 M components was then proposed, which redefines several components of Lean’s 3 M from ergonomics perspective. Fuzzy Delphi Method analysis on 12 practitioners showed overall agreement with the content, structure, and applicability of the proposed framework (threshold (d) value ≤0.2, expert consensus ≥75%, and fuzzy score ≥0.5). The findings may provide platform for lean and ergonomics practitioners to communicate and bridge the gaps between the two disciplines. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Automated guided vehicles (AGV), which are frequently used to reduce the workload of employees in production systems, are now being used in service systems. AGV has been widely used in the field of healthcare and is well suited to transporting. This study aims to provide AGV is being used in different areas of healthcare today within the scope of Industry 4.0. In recent years, the use of AGV has started to increase to reduce the workload and contamination risk of healthcare workers. In this study, it was aimed that AGVs would distribute autonomous drugs by processing patient information such as age, drug type, frequency of use and so forth. The information obtained from the internal diseases department of a university hospital was transferred to a computer simulation environment and the current situation and the proposed situation were analyzed separately, and the results were compared. The statistically verified results show that an autonomous AGV that will process patient information and distribute drugs reduced the workload of nurses by 14% in approximately a month. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the work-related physical demands of long-distance truck drivers employed by a large gas delivery company in Canada. Methods: A total of 15 truck drivers participated in a data collection that included self-reporting assessments, field observations, and direct measurements to describe daily tasks organization, postural demands, physical workload, and force exertions. Results: Truck drivers' work was characterized by long working days ranging from 9.9 to 15.1 h (mean = 11.4 h), with half (49%) of the total working time spent behind the wheel. The overall workload as measured by relative cardiac strain (18.7% RHR) was found excessive for the long term given the shift duration. Peaks of heart rate in excess of 30 beats per minute above the daily average occurred mainly while operating valves and handling heavy hoses during gas deliveries. The task of delivering gas at a client's site required a moderate work rate on average (8.3 mlO2/kg/min) requiring 24.4% or maximum work capacity on average. Conclusion: Based on multiple data sources, this study highlights the risks of over-exertion and of excessive physical fatigue in the truck drivers’ work that are coherent with the high prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in this group of workers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This is a report of a mixed-methods research study into enhancing the mental health and well-being of construction workers in the UK. Data collection concerning current practice involved an extensive literature review, interviews with construction and medical professionals and an email survey of 126 workers using 77 questions. The findings indicated that there are major mental health problems within the industry, which are proving difficult to combat because of the associated stigma. The research highlighted that in many physical health incidents, participants may neglect their responsibilities by inadequate control measures or incomplete protective equipment. There was investigation of workplace sentiments, environmental conditions, workload and pressure, social context and stigma, hazard awareness, mental health training, education and advice. Recommendations included group activities in appropriate spaces, self-help programmes and guides, volunteering, health screenings and site-specific briefings with suitable visual aids. An implication for practice is that management should focus more on the thoughts and feelings of workers to improve their engagement with the workplace and assist with their work/life balance while maintaining a safe working environment at all times. This paper concludes with a list of improvement strategies for consideration by both employers and workers. © 2020 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasingly, the smart city space is requiring a reconceptualization of forms and factors of production, including factories and their place in the smart city space. Factories have always been a part of the city and many people spend a significant part of their lives there. Cities and factories share the same physical space and draw from the same resources, such as the energy grid, communication networks, public utilities, social connections, etc. Factories and cities should share the same IoT network in order to maximize their synergy level. In this view, as ICT-enhanced solutions are being implemented and so the concept of the smart city becomes a reality, it is mandatory that the connection between the smart city and the smart factory is examined. This paper represents the first step in this direction. We are presenting a new smart way to lighten the workload for employees (especially those involved in assembly, setup and maintenance) and increase factory efficiency. We have developed a brand-new smart solution for designing and presenting work instructions. The solution can be easily adapted to use in other fields like healthcare or smart-homes. This paper presents a comparison of different types of virtual/augmented and conventional assembly instructions. Today, we face the challenge of a lack of skilled employees and a high rate of employee turnover. Both result in huge time and production losses, because new employees have to be taught simple assembly tasks over and over again. In addition, as companies begin hiring many more foreign workers who do not understand the local language, the challenge of teaching becomes even more acute. Despite this, in modern production systems we can still find ineffective and complicated books and manuals with assembly, service and measurement instructions. We have prepared several variants for non-trivial multi-step assembly instructions: traditional 'paper' instructions, video instructions, virtual instructions on screen (with/without in-situ projection and with/without a special controller). We have developed our own software system for working with and developing virtual assembly instructions. In this case the in-situ augmentation is a projection on to different parts of the workplace. 60 subjects were tested over two years in order to gather the learning curve for each of 5 types of instructions using virtual and augmented reality. We have proven that using any type other than 'paper' will shorten the learning time by approximately half. Practitioner summary: We have prepared and tested variants for non-trivial multi-step assembly instructions. 60 subjects were tested over two years in order to gather the learning curve for all 5 types of instructions - traditional paper, video instructions, virtual instructions and two types of virtual instructions combined with augmented reality in-situ projection. We have proven that using any type other than 'paper' will shorten the learning time by approximately half. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In manufacturing, augmented reality (AR)-based remote instruction systems, which enable workers to receive instructions from an avatar, are widely used. In this study, we developed such a system and investigated the effect of the body representation level of the avatar on the quality of AR-based remote instruction. Drawing on the avatar designs of previous works, three different avatar designs (“Hand only”, “Hand + Arm”, and “Body”), representing three body representation levels, were created. In the experiment with a within-participant design, the avatar pointed at blocks sequentially and participants touched each block as soon as they identified it. The results of the experiment indicate that an AR-based remote instruction system with a “Body” avatar exhibits higher usability and can enable the participants to have a lower workload and higher efficiency. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: An individual's perceptions of their workplace safety climate can influence their health and safety outcomes in the workplace. Even though union membership has been declining in the US, union members still comprise 10% of the working population and have higher-than-industry average non-fatal illness and injury rates. Due to limited research focused in this area, this study examined whether union membership was associated with worker perceptions of safety climate. Methods: This was a secondary data analysis study utilizing data from the Quality Work Life module from the General Social Survey centered on US workers aged 18 and above. Propensity-score matching was implemented to reduce potential selection bias between unionized and non-unionized workers. Linear regression explored the association between union membership and perceptions of safety climate, controlling for age, sex, education, industry, resource adequacy, supervisor support, co-worker support, and workload. Results: For perceived safety climate (on a 0–16 scale, the higher the more positive), those in union had a lower mean of perceived safety climate (12.44) compared to those not in a union (13.20). Based on the regression results, those who were in a union reported more negative perceptions of their workplace safety climate in a 12-month period (β = −0.61, p < .001). Conclusions: By demonstrating a commitment to proactive injury prevention and bolstering the business's overall safety performance indicators, businesses who are open to collaborations with unions may see some long-term benefits (e.g. return on investment, increased job satisfaction) and enhance union workers’ perceptions of safety climate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Our knowledge about the role of fly-in fly-out (FIFO) work-related factors on the well-being of workers across the FIFO work cycle is limited. This study examined the within-person effects of job demand and control on psychological states and health behaviours. The study employed a daily diary design, with 23 FIFO workers in the Australian mining industry completing a daily diary survey for 28 consecutive days across on-shift and off-shift periods. Multilevel analyses showed FIFO workers experienced higher positive affect and enjoyed better sleep quality, but consumed more alcohol, during off-shift days as compared to on-shift days. Within-person variability in daily demand (workload) was associated with higher anxious affect, whereas job control predicted lower anxious and depressed affects, higher positive affect, more alcohol consumption, and more physical activity. The within-person effect of demand on anxious affect was moderated by job control such that those who generally had more control over their jobs had a smaller effect of demand on anxiety than those with less control. Results suggest potentially modifiable aspects of FIFO work—particularly job control—may help alleviate the impact of workload on poorer health behaviours and mood. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the production plan design for a class of batch processing problem, which comes from a practical production scenario of semiconductor manufacturing in China. We introduce a new parameter, referred as salary factor, to balance the workload of the workers and the throughput of the corporation in the process of production planing, and propose a three stages optimization framework for this problem. This proposed optimization scheme is integrated in the production scheduling system to substitute the original artificial scheduling. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Warehouses play a vital role in mitigating variations in supply and demand, and in providing value-added services in a supply chain. However, our observation of supply chain practice reveals that warehousing decisions are not included when developing a distribution plan for the supply chain. This lack of integration has resulted in a substantial variation in workload (42-220%) at our industry partner's warehouse costing them millions of dollars. To address this real-world challenge, we introduce the warehouse-inventory-transportation problem (WITP) of determining an optimal distribution plan from vendors to customers via one or more warehouses in order to minimize the total distribution cost. We present a nonlinear integer programming model for the WITP considering supply chains with multiple vendors, stores, products, and time-periods, and one warehouse. The model also considers worker congestion at the warehouse that could affect worker productivity. A heuristic based on iterative local search is developed to solve industry-sized problems with up to 500 stores and 1000 products. Our experiments indicate that the distribution plans obtained via the WITP, as compared to a sequential approach, result in a substantial reduction in workload variance at the warehouse, while considerably reducing the total distribution cost. These plans, however, are sensitive to aisle configuration and technology at the warehouse, and the level and productivity of temporary workers.

AB  - In the real manufacturing process the technological operation of sewing trousers side seams was recorded using a video system. Using modern methods of industrial engineering the structure of technological operation, workload (OADM) and share of unsuitable working postures (OWAS) were determined. It was found that at the existing workplace the unfavorable relationship of man-machine-environment leads to a high degree of workload caused by the forced position of spine and head, increased abdominal pressure, and reduction in visual skills and motor skills. Using the ERGOPlan software a redesign of the existing workplace was performed, and according to the anthropometric proportions of workers seating height, height of the machine work surface, working methods were determined, and using the method of predetermined times (MTM) the optimal working method with associated time norms was determined. Dynamic and static simulation of performing the technological operation at the redesigned workplace shows that the work is done in an economically favorable posture with considerably reducing workload, which results in increasing workplace productivity while reducing fatigue.

AB  - The mental workload affects productivity workers to accomplish the task. Staff has many tasks that not only main task but additional task. The additional task is from superior in the same place or the other place. The SOP for duties and distribution of task is not clear so the fatigue can affect to productivity. The method to measure mental workload is NASA-TLX. NASA TLX has six indicators: mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, frustration, and effort. The analysis not only based on result of NASA TLX but also using statistic test. The result is performance indicator is high that described the staff not satisfied with their job has done. The staff not satisfy but the effort has been taken out is very high. The result of Mann Whitney is not different with two group of the period long term of working which divided in < 7 years and >7 years. The result of correlation test is if the staff make more effort, the satisfaction for their tasks has been done is bigger. The regression test produces an equation but cannot be used to calculation or prediction the staff mental workload. Because regression coefficient is not significant (not usable). The solution is staff must divide the task. Dissatisfaction can reduce motivation and the members cannot perform well. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Labor productivity and its influencing factors including ergonomics play a vital role in affecting the performance of construction projects. In fact, studying ergonomics and understanding the interactions among workers and their assigned tasks have shown a decrease in workers' discomfort, a positive impact on labor productivity, a reduction in project costs, and an increase in value creation. As such, several studies have been conducted in an attempt to properly assign construction tasks and optimize the performance of crews. However, no study has yet been carried out to estimate the physiological workloads of construction tasks and match them with the corresponding workers' capabilities. Therefore, this research study takes the initial steps and aims at using Digital Human Modeling (DHM) to model different construction activities and generate physiological task demands. Several construction activities that require various body postures and affect different body parts are selected and modeled using DHM. The ergonomic and physiological results are then recorded for each activity. The resulting physiological task demands will, in future work, become the foundation of a simulation framework targeted at enhancing the worker-task assignment process and properly mapping the modeled tasks to construction workers based on their physiological capabilities. © 2022 ASCE.

AB  - The inspection and classification of ceramic tiles in a production line can be done automatically by use of digital cameras and image processing algorithms. However, due to the investment and maintenance costs of these systems, there are still several firms that assign workers for ceramic tile surface defect detection. Also, human inspection system can effectively challenge this task to a good accuracy. This study aims to attract attention to the mental workload that results from high concentration during visual inspection. A mobile type eye-tracker is used to record the data for duration of fixation and number of fixations to determine fatigue that arises over a period of working time. Data are analyzed and comments are made for workers, type of the ceramic tile, and working period without rest. It is concluded that the eye tracking systems have a potential to identify human related problems during visual inspection. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Telepresence technology creates the opportunity for people that were traditionally left out of the workforce to work remotely. In the service industry, a pool of novice remote workers could teleoperate robots to perform short work stints to fill in the gaps left by the dwindling workforce. A hurdle is that consistently talking appropriately and politely imposes a severe mental burden on such novice operators and the quality of the service may suffer. In this study, we propose a teleoperation support system that lets novice remote workers talk freely without considering appropriateness and politeness while maintaining the quality of the service. The proposed system exploits intent recognition to transform casual utterances into predefined appropriate and polite utterances. We conducted a within-subject user study where 23 participants played the role of novice remote operators controlling a guardsman robot in charge of monitoring customers' behaviors. We measured the workload with and without using the proposed support system using NASA task load index questionnaires. The workload was significantly lower (p< .001) when using the proposed support system (M = 46.07, SD = 14.36) than when not using it (M = 62.74, SD = 12.70). The effect size was large (Cohen's d = 1.23).  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The ergonomic assessment of adopted working postures is essential for avoiding muscu-loskeletal risk factors in manufacturing contexts. Several observational methods based on external analyst observations are available; however, they are relatively subjective and suffer low repeatability. Over the past decade, the digitalization of this assessment has received high research interest. Robotic applications have the potential to lighten workers’ workload and improve working conditions. There-fore, this work presents a musculoskeletal risk assessment before and after robotic implementation in an assembly workstation. We also emphasize the importance of using novel and non-intrusive technologies for musculoskeletal risk assessment. A kinematic study was conducted using inertial motion units (IMU) in a convenience sample of two workers during their normal performance of assembly work cycles. The musculoskeletal risk was estimated according to a semi-automated solu-tion, called the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) report. Based on previous musculoskeletal problems reported by the company, the assessment centered on the kinematic analysis of functional wrist movements (flexion/extension, ulnar/radial deviation, and pronation/supination). The results of the RULA report showed a reduction in musculoskeletal risk using robotic-assisted assembly. Regarding the kinematic analysis of the wrist during robotic-assisted tasks, a significant posture improvement of 20–45% was registered (considering the angular deviations relative to the neutral wrist position). The results obtained by direct measurements simultaneously reflect the workload and individual characteristics. The current study highlights the importance of an in-field instrumented assessment of musculoskeletal risk and the limitations of the system applied (e.g., unsuitable for tracking the motion of small joints, such as the fingers). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Chatbots have drawn significant attention of late in both industry and academia. For most task completion bots in the industry, human intervention is the only means of avoiding mistakes in complex real-world cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing research work modeling the collaboration between task completion bots and human workers. In this paper, we introduce CoChat, a dialog management framework to enable effective collaboration between bots and human workers. In CoChat, human workers can introduce new actions at any time to handle previously unseen cases. We propose a memory-enhanced hierarchical RNN (MemHRNN) to handle the one-shot learning challenges caused by instantly introducing new actions in CoChat. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets well demonstrate that CoChat can relieve most of the human workers' workload, and get better user satisfaction rates comparing to other state-of-the-art frameworks.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration, whereby the human and the robot join their forces to achieve a task, opens new application opportunities in manufacturing. Robots can perform precise and repetitive operations while humans can execute tasks that require dexterity and problem-solving abilities. Moreover, collaborative robots can take over heavy-duty tasks. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a serious health concern and the primary cause of absenteeism at work. While the role of the human is still essential in flexible production environment, the robot can help decreasing the workload of workers. This paper describes a novel framework for task allocation of human-robot assembly applications based on capabilities and ergonomics considerations. Capable agents are determined on the basis of agent characteristics and task requirements. Ergonomics is integrated by measuring the human body posture and the related workload. The developed framework was validated on a gearbox assembly use case using the collaborative robot Baxter. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Recent emergence of safe, lightweight, and flexible robots has opened a new realm for human-robot collaboration in manufacturing. Utilizing such robots with the new human-robot interaction (HRI) functionality to interact closely and effectively with a human co-worker, we propose a novel framework for integrating HRI factors (both physical and social interactions) into the robot motion controller for human-robot collaborative assembly tasks in a manufacturing hybrid cell. To meet human physical demands in such assembly tasks, an optimal control problem is formulated for physical HRI (pHRI)-based robot motion control to keep pace with human motion progress. We further augment social HRI (sHRI) into the framework by considering a computational model of the human worker's trust in his/her robot partner as well as robot facial expressions. The human worker's trust in robot is computed and used as a metric for path selection as well as a constraint in the optimal control problem. Robot facial expression is displayed for providing additional visual feedbacks to the human worker. We evaluate the proposed framework by designing a robotic experimental testbed and conducting a comprehensive study with a human-in-the-loop. Results of this paper show that compared to the manual adjustments of robot velocity, an autonomous controller based on pHRI, pHRI and sHRI with trust, or pHRI and sHRI with trust, and emotion result in 34%, 39%, and 44% decrease in human workload and 21%, 32%, and 60% increase in robot's usability, respectively. Compared to the manual framework, human trust in robot increases by 38% and 42%, respectively, in the latter two autonomous frameworks. Moreover, the overall efficiency in terms of assembly time remains the same. Note to Practitioners - Conventionally, industrial robots are used to perform repetitive tasks in human-free cages with minimal HRI for safety concerns. Thanks to the new safety and flexibility functions embedded in human-friendly manufacturing robots, humans and robots can now collaborate closely with each other accomplishing the tasks that were previously done by human workers solely. However, existing criteria for designing robot controllers need to be modified by considering the human workers' demands since the performance of a human worker would vary due to factors such as individual strength, working pattern, and interaction with the robot. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that integrates HRI factors in controlling the motion of a robot for the collaborative assembly tasks. Within this framework, the speed of robot can be controlled such that its motion progress synchronizes with that of the human during the task to improve pHRI. Moreover, for better sHRI, human trust in robot is calculated and used to select robot path and modify its speed control. Furthermore, we dynamically change the robot facial expression to provide visual feedbacks for performance and safety concerns. The results of the experimental study show that integrating both pHRI and sHRI in the robot controller leads to a significant drop of human perceived workload and considerable increase of robot usability and human trust in robot while the overall efficiency in terms of assembly time remains intact. For practical utilization in assembly plants, sensory devices for tracking the human motion are required. The robot is also required to have built-in safety functions that reduce the impact of possible collisions between the human and the robot. We believe that this paper addresses how the implementation of human-friendly robots in the manufacturing environments can improve HRI and reduce workload. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The adopted of Massive open online courses (MOOC) in the Thailand Tourism sector is aimed at promoting the quality of human resources to reach ASEAN tourism standard. However, traditional vocational education and training do not seem to provide knowledge improvement for many of the workers in the postmodern era since the completion rate of MOOC is very low. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a knowledge improvement method for knowledge workers who are working in the tourism industry. In this study, the cognitive load theory and interactive media were employed as methods which are able to improve the knowledge workers’ learning performance via mobile devices. Two experiments were performed in order to find the optimal length of video lectures and the effectiveness of interactive media in MOOCs. The first experiment was performed on sixty-four tourism industry knowledge workers who were divided into four groups randomly. Each group was loaded with different video lengths and different segmentations. The second experiment was done on the same focus group by separating them into control and experiment groups. The experiment group was assigned to use interactive media (2D learning game) right after watching the learning video. The results show that, by using the same amount of learning time, the group who were using the smaller video lengths performed significantly better due to lower consume of information. Differences in knowledge tests were examined across different conditions of video lengths to measure the learning performance. As a result, the groups which were equipped with interactive media achieved higher test scores than those without it. The evaluation method for the performance test was the same as in the first experiment. The results indicate that the interactive group with shorter of video lengths performed significantly better than the other group exposed to traditional online learning (using longer videos in a non-interactive manner). © 2019, ECTI Association Sirindhon International Institute of Technology.

AB  - We have evaluated the consequences of work organization on musculoskeletal health. Using a postal questionnaire, answered by 1600 female grocery store workers, their main work tasks were identified and four work groups were defined (cashier, picking, and delicatessen work, and a mixed group, who performed a mix of these tasks). The crude odds ratios (ORs) for neck/shoulder complaints were 1.5 (95% CI 1.0-2.2), 1.1 (0.7-1.5) and 1.6 (1.1-2.3), respectively, compared to mixed work. Adjusting for individual and psychosocial factors had no effect on these ORs. For elbows/hands, no significant differences were found. Technical measurements of the workload showed large differences between the work groups. Picking work was the most strenuous, while cashier work showed low loads. Quantitative measures of variation revealed for mixed work high between minutes variation and the highest between/within minutes variation. Combining work tasks with different physical exposure levels increases the variation and may reduce the risk of musculoskeletal complaints. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Ergonomics is one area of science that study on the workload and fatigue of the workers. The industry needs to increase operational time to 24 hours and 7 days, has become a necessity to meet customer satisfaction. The impact of increasing operating time, necessitated employees working at the night shift, one of which is security officer, with main task of maintaining the safety and security of the company and its employees for 24 hours. Working the night shift can lower performance and interfere of health, because it causes drowsiness, fatigue and physical sluggishness. The objectives of this research is to evaluate the workload of the security officers working the night shift. This research using SOFI, NASA-TLX, Heart Rate and Energy Expenditure method. Results of this research prove that methods can used to determine the workload, with light categories. The Security officer experience fatigue after working 5 days consecutive, be marked the emergence of drowsiness. As a recommendation, a good of work shift rotation systems is shorter rotation system, i.e. 2 days of morning shift; 2 days of day shift; 2 days of nights shift, and 2 days off, with this rotation system, security officer will only experience a mild drowsiness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Mine workers in South Africa face challenges relating to poor health and safety, including fatigue risks, and poor socioeconomic and living conditions. Fatigue results in impaired mental and physical performance. The aim of this study was to assess contributors to fatigue of mine workers in South Africa. Methods: Data collection took place at four gold mines and one platinum mine in South Africa. A total of 21 focus groups were held with individuals in management, union representatives, and mine workers, and 564 questionnaires were completed by mine workers to gather information about fatigue and potential contributors to fatigue at these mines. Results: Qualitatively (through focus groups), fatigue was attributed to extended working hours, harsh working conditions, high workloads, production pressure, and resource constraints, along with aspects relating to demographic and socioeconomic factors, living conditions, lifestyle, health, and wellness. Greater fatigue was significantly associated with younger age, indebtedness, a lack of exercise, poor nutrition, less sleep, increased alcohol use, poor self-reported health, more sick leave, higher stress, and lower job satisfaction. Conclusion: The aim of the study was achieved; numerous work-, sociodemographic-, lifestyle-, and wellness-related factors were linked to fatigue in the participating mine workers. Contributors to fatigue should be addressed to improve health, safety, and sustainability in the industry. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In today's INDUSTRY 4.0 context, the growing need to improve performances and sustainability of working environment is looking forward to developing interoperable and service-oriented systems with real time capabilities. This is boosting the installation of decentralized and reliable robotics cells with flexible cooperative capabilities. They enroll smart operators'flexibility and robot productivity in collaborative robotics (properly cobots) applications. This paper consists of a state-of-the-art review on cognitive load in manufacturing with characterization of human-robot collaboration. A simulated analysis of a collaborative working cell is performed. An Agent Based (AB) model is presented with application in the automotive sector. The cell consists of logistics AGVs equipped with a manipulator. They interact with working robots and human operator. Robots collaborate in cell and they cooperate with operator on assisted task using Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). The load of human in the collaborative work-cell- set on state of art - is measured according with Functional states over different Behavioral Structures (FBS). We quantified the load of cognitive factors while reporting interaction analysis.

AB  - Welders are widely used in machinery manufacturing and machining industry. In the process of electric welding, accidents are often caused by some unsafe behaviors. This paper focuses on the intelligent recognition method of welding flame, which can reduce the accidents of welding flame to a certain extent. Due to the difficulties in observing workers on job sites, developing an algorithm for intelligent identification of unsafe factors is significant. Firstly, Hue,Saturation and Value (HSV) color space with strong robustness is selected to segment the mark image with threshold value, and the region of interest in which the welding fame is located is segment; secondly, the Progressive Probabilistic Hough transform is used to detect the region of interest, judge the number of existing lines, and finally determine whether there is welding flame in this region. In this way, the welding flame can be better detected, which can reduce the workload of managers and is beneficial to the supervision of the management personnel. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) is considered an emerging Industry 4.0 technology with the potential to significantly change operations and supply chain management. In this context, this study aims to explore the effects of AM adoption on how companies conduct business. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review including 136 papers was conducted. As a result, a framework including all of the effects (consolidated and inconclusive) found of AM adoption on a company's business was developed. While various effects (e.g., the feasibility of a complex product, the freedom of product design, mass customization capability, and product variety) have frequently been studied in the literature and are consolidated, some are still considered consolidated effects but presenting only conceptual studies (e.g., enterprise reliability, equipment reliability/availability for maintenance, information flow, and production democratization) then needed practical research. In addition, there are still contradictions regarding the effects of AM on competitiveness, cost, dependence on the supplier, environmental impact, health and safety, product quality, production efficiency, responsiveness, supply chain complexity and flexibility, worker qualifications, number of workers and workload (inconclusive effects). In the end, this paper identifies management and technical/technological aspects to be considered when adopting AM, which have positive or negative effects on the AM adoption process. The most important aspects include technology, production strategy, technical requirements and supply chain distribution, influencing AM adoption positively or negatively. Then, we also highlight some inconclusive research results from the literature, presenting opportunities for future research. This work may support managers and policy makers in better understanding the AM adoption process and their potential business impacts. © 2020

AB  - Due to the introduction of more and more new technologies into the work environment, the role of the worker often changes from executing a task to monitoring an automated system. Monitoring tasks, however, can induce high levels of mental workload and thus lead to a decrease in the worker's performance and consequently to an increase in the risk of making serious errors. A promising solution to this problem is the use of assistance systems (AS). As the worker still remains responsible for an error-free operation of the automated system, the AS should be designed human-centered. Hence, it is crucial, to examine the psychological factors that influence the user's acceptance of the AS in order to ensure a successful longterm human-machine collaboration. A concept for a human-centered AS for a monitoring task is presented. Thereby, different assistance types and strategies as well as methods to determine the right point of time to apply these strategies during the task are looked at. Finally, challenges for the development of such an AS are discussed and possible solutions are proposed. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This article presents an approach in which software agents fulfill transportation tasks in a production facility. Therefore, the coordination of different agents is managed in a decentralized way using a multi-agent system. Various aspects of the market economy are implemented into the behaviors of the agents. Since the heterogeneous system consists not only of automated transport systems but also of the human worker, important features of the interaction between humans, trust and reputation, are implemented into the agents' behaviors. The overall approach is simulated and the benefits of those aspects for the overall system e.g. workload of the transport resources is investigated. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The construction industry is claimed to suffer from low productivity often caused by its complex, individualistic and unstructured nature. The construction workers’ situational awareness (SA) is an insufficiently investigated and overlooked perspective in current project and production management literature to increase productivity in construction projects. This paper discusses the role of construction workers in planning and control of production and the possible impact of SA for on-site processes integrating knowledge and expertise from construction workers. The paper reviews the literature concerning construction workers’ on-site situation, integration in production planning and control processes and the possibilities for empowering workers with SA. Providing real-time situational data can empower workers to make better decisions based on accurate, transparent, structured and trustworthy data. It is concluded that a better understanding and availability of the project information and progress can free up workers' workload, to focus their capacity on the task delivery. This will ultimately lead to a boost in productivity on-site. Furthermore, the paper opens avenue for further research and how to capture the current state of on-site SA of construction workers through a methodical approach including quantitative and qualitative methods. © 2020 IGLC 28 - 28th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction 2020.

AB  - Cognitive ergonomics and the mental health of production workers have attracted increasing interest in industrial companies. However, there is still not much research available as it is regarding physical ergonomics and muscular load. This paper designs an experiment to analyze the cognitive ergonomics and mental stress of shop floor production workers interacting with different user interfaces of a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) that is adjustable for analyzing the influence of other assistive systems, too. This approach is going to be designed with the Design of Experiments (DoE) method. Therefore, the respective goals and factors are going to be determined. The environment will be the laboratories of the University of Applied Sciences Amberg-Weiden and its Campus for Digitalization in Amberg. In detail, there will be a sample assembly process from the automotive supplier industry for demonstration purposes. At this laboratory, the MES software from the European benchmark SAP is installed, and the respective standard Production Operator Desk is going to be used with slight adaptions. In order to make the cognitive ergonomics measurable, different approaches are going to be used. For instance, body temperature, heart rate and skin conductance as well as subjective methods of self-assessment are planned. The result of this paper is a ready-to-run experiment with sample data for each classification of participants. Further, possible limitations and adjustments are going to be discussed. Finally, an approach to validating the expected results is going to be shown and future intentions are going to be discussed. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the construction industry has revolutionized safety, surveying, quality monitoring, and maintenance assessment. UAVs are increasingly used to prevent accidents caused by falls from heights or being struck by falling objects by ensuring workers comply with safety protocols. This study focuses on leveraging UAV technology to enhance labor safety by monitoring the use of personal protective equipment, particularly helmets, among construction workers. The developed UAV system utilizes the tensorflow technique and an alert system to detect and identify workers not wearing helmets. Employing the high-precision, high-speed, and widely applicable Faster R-CNN method, the UAV can accurately detect construction workers with and without helmets in real-time across various site conditions. This proactive approach ensures immediate feedback and intervention, significantly reducing the risk of injuries and fatalities. Additionally, the implementation of UAVs minimizes the workload of site supervisors by automating safety inspections and monitoring, allowing for more efficient and continuous oversight. The experimental results indicate that the UAV system’s high precision, recall, and processing capabilities make it a reliable and cost-effective solution for improving construction site safety. The precision, mAP, and FPS of the developed system with the R-CNN are 93.1%, 58.45%, and 27 FPS. This study demonstrates the potential of UAV technology to enhance safety compliance, protect workers, and improve the overall quality of safety management in the construction industry. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The workplaces on construction sites are comparatively little automated, as they have a high degree of flexibility in tasks and a diverse physical environment, that makes a high level of automation difficult. However, the physical workload is often very high for construction workers, leading to a high risk for musculoskeletal disorders. It would therefore be conceivable to use physical assistance systems to reduce the workload of the construction worker. This might be achieved by collaborative robots: they can combine the advantages of a robot with those of humans to adapt to different situations. The following article develops a framework for the requirements that are necessary in order to design a collaborative robot for the work on construction sites. For this engineering and ergonomic approaches are combined. Based on a work system approach and requirements examined for fixed work cells in the industry, the characteristics of the work on a construction site are clustered to. That can be used to derive requirements for the assistive robot. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wearable augmented reality (AR) refers to the technology that the virtual models and annotations generated by computers can be superimposed on the real scene, and which can be utilized to help workers perform intuitive manual assembly operations. Nevertheless, most of the existing AR-aided assembly processes are carried out by triggering the step-by-step visual instruction manually, lacking scene-aware generation for the assembly assistance accordingly. To facilitate an intelligent AR-aided assembly, this paper proposed an edge computing (EC)-driven Scene-aware Intelligent AR Assembly (EC-SIARA) system, which can understand the assembly status on the fly with the lightweight wearable AR glass, and thus, worker-centered assistance is available to provide intuitive visual guidance accordingly. In beginning, the connection between the wearable AR glasses and EC system is established, which can alleviate the computing burden for the resource-constraint wearable AR glasses, and a high-efficiency scene awareness module during the manual assembly process is achieved. And then, based on context understanding of the current assembly status, the intuitive instructions can be triggered automatically, avoiding the operator’s cognitive load to launch the next AR instruction strictly. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed EC-SIARA system, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can realize a worker-center AR assembly process, improve the assembly efficiency, and reduce the occurrence of assembly errors effectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Construction workers are commonly subjected to ergonomic risks due to awkward postures and/or excessive manual material handling. Accurate ergonomic assessment will facilitate ergonomic risk identification and the subsequent mitigation. Traditional assessment methods such as visual observation and on-body sensors rely on subjective judgement and are intrusive in nature. To cope up with the limitations of the existing technologies, a computer vision and smart insole-based joint-level ergonomic workload calculation methodology is proposed for construction workers. Accordingly, this method could provide an objective and detailed ergonomic assessment for various construction tasks. Firstly, construction workers’ skeleton data is extracted using a smartphone camera with an advanced deep learning algorithm. Secondly, smart insoles are used to quantify the plantar pressures while the worker performs a construction activity. Finally, the gathered data is fed to an inverse dynamic model in order to calculate the joint torques and workloads. The aforementioned approach was tested with experiments comprising simulations of material handling, plastering and rebar. The results reveal that the developed methodology has the potential to provide detailed and accurate ergonomic assessment. Overall, this research contributes to the knowledge of occupational safety and health in construction management by providing a novel approach to assess the risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

AB  - Human robot collaboration is becoming the norm in the workplace, due to the benefits robots can bring to efficiency and production. However, this creates highly complex and dynamic workplaces that human operators need to adapt to. Industry 5.0 promotes the use of robotics and smart technologies in a more human-centric way. However, research on how operators are affected by those changes is needed to better understand how to move towards human-centricity. As such, an experimental study was designed and performed on human robot collaborative assembly. The main aim was to investigate the correlation between cognitive load and quality due to collaboration. Here, the preliminary results of the experimental study are presented in order to remark relevant states influencing work allocation. The results showcased the need for better training and more knowledge for the operators, as well as involving operators in process and workplace design. This study helps contribute knowledge on robot implementation and process design for human robot collaboration for both researchers and operations management, as it showcases the need to involve operators in those steps due to the feedback they can provide due to their experience. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the association between worker characteristics, workplace factors, and workrelated musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in Nigeria's construction industry. Methods: A cross-sectional site-by-site survey was conducted in 5 existing construction companies in Uyo, Nigeria. The subjects (n = 1200 males), aged 18-55 years, filled in the semistructured Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire and the job content questionnaire on demographics, work and lifestyle characteristics, and workplace risk factors for WMSDs. Results: The overall prevalence of WMSDs was 39.25%. Differences in age, race, weight, body mass index (BMI), education status, and employment status were significantly associated with the prevalence of WMSDs. Prevalence according to trade was as follows: ironworkers highest at 49% and administrative staff lowest at 31%. Ironworkers (55.7%), administrative staff (53.3%), and security staff (38.7%) scored higher on physical, psychosocial, and individual risk factors, respectively. Workplace factors with increased odds for WMSDs were psychological demands and mental workload, age, BMI, low work experience, low education status, awkward movement of head and arms, working against force or vibration, fast work pace, and race. Conclusion: The recorded high prevalence was multifactorial in etiology; hence, multi-intervention strategies are required.

AB  - Production systems contain advanced automated processes, and humans are involved in activities, such as monitoring, managing and/or operating, to ensure the right functioning of these systems. The challenge for industries is to develop human-centred scheduling systems that orchestrate the interaction between human and machines devices considering both operations productivity and human well-being. In this paper, a cyber-physical production system integrating a smart station is proposed to dynamically change the schedule of tasks to human operators, regarding the cognitive fatigue level during execution. The smart station consists in a human operator connected to a galvanometer that tracks electric currents on his skin coupled to a virtual holon that seeks the human well-being minimising his cognitive fatigue estimated from the tracking of the current. This Holon is also in charge of the modification of the scheduling through the adaption of the workload. A real experiment has been conducted to validate the contribution of the proposed approach and the results demonstrate significant mitigation of human wellbeing degradation in term of cognitive fatigue. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Job rotation is often recommended to optimize physical work demands and prevent work-related musculoskeletal complaints, but little is known about possible facilitators and barriers to its usefulness and ease of use. Following a qualitative research design, semi-structured interviews with employers (n=12) and workers (n=11) from the construction industry were conducted. Organizational climate, job autonomy, job characteristics and work processes were mentioned as either facilitators or barriers on an organizational level. Worker characteristics, work behavior and attitude were mentioned as either facilitators or barriers on an individual level. Following a structured approach to assess usefulness of job rotation to optimize physical work exposures and identifying barriers to usefulness and ease of use in relevant stakeholder groups is necessary in order to select or develop strategies to overcome these barriers, or to reject job rotation as a useful or easy to use intervention in the given context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Complete and accurate data is an important enabler of effective supply chain decision making. Despite the increasing efforts to fully automate data collection processes using advanced sensors and scanners, human operators are still in charge of data entry tasks in most industries. Unfortunately, operators do not often comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and do not always exhibit the consistency and commitment required to collect high-quality data. In fact, data collection is often perceived as a non-value-adding activity that increases workloads and lowers productivity. We aim to empirically study the extent to which compliance with SOPs for data collection is affected by some of the key factors. Using a large dataset obtained from a leading postal service provider in Australia, we find that an operator's workload, fatigue, and related work experience directly impact the compliance levels. We also find that a company's compliance reinforcement intervention to improve compliance behavior can moderate these impacts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to (1) quantify the respective physical workloads of bar bending and fixing; and (2) compare the physiological and perceptual responses between bar benders and bar fixers. Field studies were conducted during the summer in Hong Kong from July 2011 to August 2011 over six construction sites. Synchronized physiological, perceptual, and environmental parameters were measured from construction rebar workers. The average duration of the 39 field measurements was 151.1 ± 22.4 min under hot environment (WBGT = 31.4 ± 2.2 °C), during which physiological, perceptual and environmental parameters were synchronized. Energy expenditure of overall rebar work, bar bending, and bar fixing were 2.57, 2.26 and 2.67 Kcal/min (179, 158 and 186 W), respectively. Bar fixing induced significantly higher physiological responses in heart rate (113.6 vs. 102.3 beat/min, p < 0.05), oxygen consumption (9.53 vs. 7.14 ml/min/kg, p < 0.05), and energy expenditure (2.67 vs. 2.26 Kcal/min, p < 0.05) (186 vs. 158 W, p < 0.05) as compared to bar bending. Perceptual response was higher in bar fixing but such difference was not statistically significant. Findings of this study enable the calculation of daily energy expenditure of rebar work. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - This study employed a deductive research approach and a survey strategy to assess risk perception and its influencing factors among construction workers in Malawi. Three specific construction hazards and their associated risks were selected. The hazards were working at height (WAH)  manual handling of loads (MHL) and heavy workload or intense pressure to be more productive (HWP). The study engaged multistage sampling of 376 subjects. Univariate analysis, factor analysis and multiple linear regressions were performed in order to determine the main influencing factors among the independent variables. The study established that workers were aware of risks posed by their work. The majority perceived the risk associated with WAH, MHL and HWP as very high (62.7%, =8.80 ± 1.95); (48.5%, =8.10 ± 2.38); (57.9%, =8.49 ± 2.22) respectively. The study identified six factors as variables that showed a significant effect on workers' perception of risk (p < 0.05). These factors were: dreaded factor,  avoidability and controllability,  expert knowledge,  personal knowledge,  education level, and age . It is concluded that contractors in the Malawian construction industry should integrate analysis of behaviors and risk perception of the workers and other players to guide the identification of better health and safety interventions at their worksites. © 2020 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

AB  - The productivity of the workers is affected by the Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs) which common cause of health problems, sick leave and it can result in decreased quality of work and increased absenteeism. The objective of this study is to evaluate and investigate the postural workload of sewing machine operators in the assembly of upholstery in furniture factory by using the Ovako Working Posture Analysing System (OWAS) with sampling. The results indicated that posture code 2111 (back code: 2 - bent forward; arms code: 1 - both below the shoulder joint; legs code: 1 - sitting position; load code: - 1 less than 10 kg) was the most common working posture rating 38.1%; 63.9% of positions displayed non-neutral back postures and 52% received harmful action categories. The performed assembly tasks have an influence on harmless and harmful action categories. This study is crucial on assembly, and in the future work allows develop a framework for assessment the physical risk of WRMSDs in assembly. © The authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.

AB  - Telerobotic operation, i.e., a human operator to manipulate remote robotic systems at a distance, has started to gain its popularity in the construction industry. It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye-tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages. © 2021

AB  - Physical fatigue in the workplace can lead to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), especially in occupations that require repetitive, mid-air movements, such as manufacturing and assembly tasks in industry settings. The current paper endeavors to validate an existing torque-based fatigue prediction model for lifting tasks. The model uses anthropometrics and the maximum torque of the individual to predict the time to fatigue. Twelve participants took part in the study which measured body composition parameters and the maximum force produced by the shoulder joint in flexion, followed by three lifting tasks for the shoulder in flexion, including isometric and dynamic tasks with one and two hands. Inertial measurements units (IMUs) were worn by participants to determine the torque at each instant to calculate the endurance time and CE, while a self-subjective questionnaire was utilized to assess physical exertion, the Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. The model was effective for static and two-handed tasks and produced errors in the range of [28.62 49.21] for the last task completed, indicating the previous workloads affect the endurance time, even though the individual perceives they are fully rested. The model was not effective for the one-handed dynamic task and differences were observed between males and females, which will be the focus of future work.An individualized, torque-based fatigue prediction model, such as the model presented, can be used to design worker-specific target levels and workloads, take inter and intra individual differences into account, and put fatigue mitigating interventions into place before fatigue occurs; resulting in potentially preventing WMSDs, aiding in worker wellbeing and benefitting the quality and efficiency of the work output.Clinical Relevance - This research provides the basis for an individualized, torque-based approach to the prediction of fatigue at the shoulder joint which can be used to assign worker tasks and rest breaks, design worker specific targets and reduce the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in occupational settings. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In the era of Industry 4.0, the importance of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the advancement of modern manufacturing and automation is paramount. Understanding the intricate physiological responses of the operator when they interact with a cobot is essential, especially during programming tasks. To this aim, wearable sensors have become vital for real-time monitoring of worker well-being, stress, and cognitive load. This article presents an innovative dataset (SenseCobot) of physiological signals recorded during several collaborative robotics programming tasks. This dataset includes various measures like ElectroCardioGram (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), ElectroDermal Activity (EDA), body temperature, accelerometer, ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), emotions and subjective responses from NASA-TLX questionnaires for a total of 21 participants. By sharing dataset details, collection methods, and task designs, this article aims to drive research in HRC advancing understanding of the User eXperience (UX) and fostering efficient, intuitive robotic systems. This could promote safer and more productive HRC amid technological shifts and help decipher intricate physiological signals in different scenarios. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper is a technical description of a novel Augmented Reality application in the industrial domain of furniture production. In the presented case, workers suffered from high cognitive load in doing end-of-line quality inspection and individual handling of a high variety of products. The proposed solution consists of a Spatial Augmented Reality system, where a projector directly displays information on the product to assist the worker. At the same time results of an in-line quality inspections are shown which can be interactively modified through human gestures. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) in contrast to other industrial augmented reality applications the described one technically builds upon a deep neural net based pose estimation. This allows a seamless interaction with the system and tracking of human actions rather than deriving them from the current state of the work piece, (2) the paper recapitulates experiences and results of the approach with a focus on lessons learned for using human pose estimation in smart production. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The Indian brick industry is an unorganized sector in which large numbers of migrant women workers are employed. A survey was conducted on 62 women workers working in different brickfields of West Bengal to assess their physiological workload, nutritional profile, total energy expenditure and energy balance. Energy intake was calculated using physiological fuel values of carbohydrate, fat and protein. From the results it is seen that 13% of the sample population falls under severe (grade III) chronic energy deficiency. The average daily consumption of the workers was comparatively lower than their daily energy expenditure, considering the nature of the job which falls under heavy to extremely heavy categories. This negative energy balance is effectively observed in the nutritional anthropometry data. Thus, an immediate ergonomics intervention with better nutrition should be implemented to improve the health status of the workers so they can safely continue to work for a longer period. © 2016 Central Institute for Labour Protection – National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

AB  - Excessive workloads (physical and mental) has been indicated as potential risk factors to health problems in many industries. Incorporating with wearable sensors, biofeedback techniques have been applied in many fields to acquire various physiological responses and convey audio/visual signals for operators to lighten workloads, regulate stress, improve health, and better performances. This study evaluates the efficacy of integrating audio biofeedback device with real-time personal physiological strains monitoring system on reducing physiological strains for simulated treadmill walking tasks with medium and heavy loads. Ten male subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The results indicated that biofeedback with associated measure showed significant effect on skin temperature and heart rate. Task load showed significant effect on all physiological responses including heart rate, tympanic temperature, and skin temperature, and subjective score of perceived exertion. Providing audio biofeedback signal to cue the subjects to take precaution measure could decrease skin temperature and heart rate of the subjects by 0.18°C and 6.1 bpm, respectively. Combining wearable sensing technology and audio biofeedback technique could be implemented to provide real-time monitoring information to help the workers take precaution measures to reduce workloads and potentially preserve their health and safety © Copyright: The Author(s).

AB  - Crowdsourcing is used in academia and industry to solve tasks that are easy for humans but hard for computers, in natural language processing mostly to annotate data. The quality of annotations is affected by problems in the task design, task operation, and task evaluation that workers face with requesters in crowdsourcing processes. To learn about the major problems, we provide a short but comprehensive survey based on two complementary studies: (1) a literature review where we collect and organize problems known from interviews with workers, and (2) an empirical data analysis where we use topic modeling to mine workers’ complaints from a new English corpus of workers’ forum discussions. While literature covers all process phases, problems in the task evaluation are prevalent, including unfair rejections, late payments, and unjustified blockings of workers. According to the data, however, poor task design in terms of malfunctioning environments, bad workload estimation, and privacy violations seems to bother the workers most. Our findings form the basis for future research on how to improve crowdsourcing processes. © 2020 COLING 2020 - 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference.

AB  - Objective: We developed an extensively general closed-loop system to improve human interaction in various multitasking scenarios, with semi-autonomous agents, processes, and robots. Background: Much technology is converging toward semi-independent processes with intermittent human supervision distributed over multiple computerized agents. Human operators multitask notoriously poorly, in part due to cognitive load and limited working memory. To multitask optimally, users must remember task order, e.g., the most neglected task, since longer times not monitoring an element indicates greater probability of need for user input. The secondary task of monitoring attention history over multiple spatial tasks requires similar cognitive resources as primary tasks themselves. Humans can not reliably make more than ~2 decisions/s. Methods: Participants managed a range of 4-10 semi-autonomous agents performing rescue tasks. To optimize monitoring and controlling multiple agents, we created an automated short-term memory aid, providing visual cues from users' gaze history. Cues indicated when and where to look next, and were derived from an inverse of eye fixation recency. Results: Contingent eye tracking algorithms drastically improved operator performance, increasing multitasking capacity. The gaze aid reduced biases, and reduced cognitive load, measured by smaller pupil dilation. Conclusion: Our eye aid likely helped by delegating short-term memory to the computer, and by reducing decision-making load. Past studies used eye position for gaze-aware control and interactive updating of displays in application-specific scenarios, but ours is the first to successfully implement domain-general algorithms. Procedures should generalize well to process control, factory operations, robot control, surveillance, aviation, air traffic control, driving, military, mobile search and rescue, and many tasks where probability of utility is predicted by duration since last attention to a task. © 2015 Taylor, Bilgrien, He and Siegelmann.

AB  - The increasing demand to customize vehicles and thus the higher product variety affects the workplaces at the automobile industry. The work tasks become more complex due to an increasing information density and modern production technologies, i.e. robots, linked production facilities and the progress towards the digitalization of production steps. Assistive information systems, that provide relevant information to the worker, have been widely researched, but there is little research on evaluating working stations beforehand regarding their potential of implementing assistive systems. Within this paper, we propose a modified application of a standard evaluation method for comparing different representatives of assistive systems, i.e. paper instructions, IT glasses and hand-held devices. Based on a user study at a manual assembly workplace, we compare these assistive systems. Using the Methods-Time Measurement method for comparison, our results reveal that the IT glass and the tablet, as the representatives for IT-supported systems, lead to significant faster task completions and significant differences in the information processes compared to the paper-based instructions. Additional questionnaires concerning the cognitive load and the assessment of the assistive systems regarding the ease of use, level of satisfaction and performance, support the previous findings. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Advanced production environments emerged as the good solution to address the modern market challenges asking for a wide product mix and low time to market. Within cellular systems, made of independent, modular and flexible working areas, tailored on families of similar products, Serus are of increasing adoption for both manufacturing and assembly tasks. Among them, the so-called divisional Serus are the first step to move from the traditional production lines to a production environment made of a set of identical working areas, parallelising activities and enabling potential productivity increase. Despite their adoption in industry, starting from the electronic sector and moving forward, reference analytic models to predict divisional Seru productivity are rare in the literature, while their formulation and application is a gap to fill. This paper addresses this gap in theory, supporting the transition toward Seru production environment by proposing and proofing the analytic closed-form expressions getting the expected productivity of a divisional Seru made of a generic number of workers and a) one (base case), b) two (extension) and c) a generic number (general case) of product types to produce. Together with the steps to get the productivity expressions for these three cases of immediate practical applicability and not yet proposed by the literature, a case study and sensitivity analysis on the divisional Seru dimension showcase the proposed model industrial use and impact on the expected productivity. Key results highlight a stationary behaviour of the working time for all workers making the Seru productivity dependent on the sum of the workers speed and the product type workloads. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advances in the development of Augmented Reality (AR) hardware and software allow for novel opportunities to positively influence the traditional construction industry. Recent research studied the feasibility of various AR devices for supporting construction assembly tasks, however, there is limited work examining the usability of AR head-mounted display (HMD) in relation to construction workers' cognitive skills such as situation awareness. This study evaluated three information display types (paper blueprint, tag-along image and conformal model) during wood frame assembly of three different scales (small, medium, and large) to investigate how AR HMDs impact user's situation awareness with respect to mental workload. Eighteen construction engineering students were recruited in a within-subjects experiment. The findings showed no significant difference in both the mental workload and the situation awareness for all three display types, suggesting that AR displays did not generate significant excessive mental burden or distractions on users in comparison to traditional paper-based information. Specifically comparing the AR displays, the results revealed that user's mental workload was affected by field of view (FOV) restriction in AR HMD, whereas situation awareness wasn't impacted. © 2023 The author(s).

AB  - Efficient implementation of robots in dynamic, human-populated construction sites will require the assistance and supervision of workers. Several hazards exist when workers are within the robots' working envelope, including high mental stress induced by the robot as well as the risk of physical collision. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes a cyber-physical system (CPS) for safe, worker-centered human-robot collaboration (HRC). The physical components of the CPS include a wearable biosensor for assessing workers' mental conditions and a video camera for evaluating the risk of collision accidents. The cyber component incorporates a machine learning layer that employs a kernelized logistic regression to translate worker bio-signals into distinct physiological states. Simultaneously, the system monitors the relative distance between workers and robots by applying computer vision techniques (i.e., video frame differencing, dilation, and contour detection). To test the feasibility of the proposed CPS, six subjects were asked to perform a series of bricklaying tasks jointly with a vehicle robot with different risks of collision (various distances from the robot) and at different levels of cognitive load (various tasks' complexity). The findings revealed that the proposed CPS allows the co-bot to adjust its speed relative to the subject's physiological states with 93.70% accuracy. In addition, the proposed system shows promising performance in collision avoidance with the accurate monitoring of position between robots and humans. The results unfold the feasibility of the proposed CPS in enhancing safe and intelligent HRC in construction under the trend of Industry 4.0. © 2021 Computing in Civil Engineering 2021 - Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2021.

AB  - The New Zealand forestry industry has one of the highest fatality and injury rates of any industrial sector in the country. Worker fatigue has been identified as one of the main contributing factors. Currently no independent and objective large data source is available that might support an analysis of this, or provide the basis for ongoing monitoring to further investigate. In order to successfully manage fatigue in the forestry workplace, we must identify suitable ways of detecting it. Industry partners are increasingly looking at monitoring solutions (particularly lightweight, wearable technology) that aim to measure worker activities and physiological metrics in order to determine if they are fatigued. In this article we present the results of studies which investigate whether or not such technology can capture meaningful data in a reliable way that is both practical and usable within the forestry domain. Two series of studies were undertaken with in-situ forestry workers using reaction and decision-making times as a measure of potential impairment, while considering activity levels (via step count and heart rate) and job-roles. We present the results of these studies and further provide a comparison of results across different ambient temperatures (winter vs. summer periods). The results of our studies suggest that it may not be possible to identify correlations between workloads (based on both physical and cognitive stresses) and fatigue measures using in-situ measurements as results are highly personalised to individual workers and can be misleading if the wider context is not also taken into consideration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Work-related musculoskeletal disorders pose a significant threat to the health, safety, and retention of skilled workers in the construction industry. Construction trades, such as floor layers, perform physically demanding work involving lifting materials and maintaining awkward postures, triggering low back disorders. Active back-support exoskeletons have emerged as potential preventive technology. This paper evaluates the suitability of a commercially available active back-support exoskeleton for a simulated flooring task by assessing measures such as range of motion, perceived level of exertion, and cognitive load. No significant difference was observed in the comparison of these measures with and without the active exoskeleton. However, the use of the exoskeleton triggered slight reductions in the range of motion of the back, perceived exertion, and mental demand. These preliminary findings could motivate more studies into the design and evaluation of similar technologies for improving construction workforce health and safety. © International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2023.All rights reserved.

AB  - Every year, companies spend millions of euros for Work related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). In order to reduce this cost and pain at work, they started to integrate Physical Assistance Device (PAD) such as exoskeletons. These new products aim to provide physical assistance to the operator but their integration is facing many barriers such as morphological adaptability, bad usability and a negative perception among workers. Exoskeletons are bringing a new type of interaction with human that is crucial to understand. This paper addresses the emerging issue of the impact of PAD on the hardness of manufacturing working tasks and on the usability satisfaction of workers. The use case focuses on a sanding operation on a catamaran hull, with an upper body passive exoskeleton provided by our partner Skel-ex. Experimental measurements such as cardiac cost, posture analysis and usability tests are carried out on a set of participants during finishing tasks. In order to better understand how exoskeletons support able-bodied people at work and reduce fatigue, we present results that show a positive impact of the assistance on physical workload. © 2018 EW materials.

AB  - Purpose: Seru (cell) manufacturing system has achieved huge success in production. However, related research is limited, especially, the problem of cross-trained worker assignment. The purpose of this paper is to solve this problem for two representative seru types, divisional and rotating seru, and subsequently, compare throughput performance between the two seru types under reasonable worker-task assignment. Design/methodology/approach: For the cross-trained worker assignment problem, this research presents new models aiming at maximum throughput of seru and workload balance of workers under considering skill levels (SLs) and several practical constraints. Furthermore, factorial experiments that involve four factors, the number of tasks (NT), gap of task time, SL and gap of SL, are performed to compare throughput performance between divisional and rotating seru. Findings: First, the maximum throughput of the divisional seru is better than that of the rotating seru under suitable worker assignment. Second, in the seru which has less difference of task time, throughput performance of the rotating seru is better than the divisional seru when the NT is close to the number of assigned workers. Moreover, the influence tendency of the four factors on throughput gap between the two seru types is significant. Originality/value: This research addresses the worker-task assignment for divisional and rotating seru based on their characteristics. Several findings can help decision maker select more applicable seru type according to various production environments from the perspective of optimum throughput. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the last few decades, studies have demonstrated the correlation between worker well-being and the performance of production systems. This paper addresses the problem of assigning workers to tasks in a workshop system. In this context, recent researches have focused on the ergonomics assessment, often neglecting the evaluation of the workers’ performance. This study aims to formulate a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the workforce scheduling problem and improve the performance of the system integrating ergonomics and human skills. To overcome the complexity of the combinatorial problem, a constructive heuristic procedure is developed. Moreover, a novel approach is proposed to determine the workers’ skills. Human performance is modelled in terms of the time required to perform consecutive tasks, considering different sequences of tasks. In addition, the model was applied to a real case study to verify its feasibility. Different scenarios are tested, considering different levels of exposure to different risk factors. The results indicate that a limited increase in the makespan enables decreasing the risk level and the achievement of an excellent workload balance among workers in terms of time spent in performing tasks. Moreover, the heuristic procedure has demonstrated to perform well on instances of realistic size, and it could be adapted to many manufacturing systems to solve the problem in real industrial contexts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is uncertain how the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology transforms industrial work. We address this question from the perspective of cognitive systems, which, in this case, includes considerations of AI and process transparency, resilience, division of labor, and worker skills. We draw from a case study on glass tempering that includes a machine-vision-based quality control system and an advanced automation process control system. Based on task analysis and background literature, we develop the concept of hybrid intelligence that implies balanced AI transparency that supports upskilling and resilience. So-called fragmented intelligence, in turn, may result from the combination of the complexity of advanced automation along with the complexity of the process physics that places critical emphasis on expert knowledge. This combination can result in the so-called “double black box effect”, given that designing for understandability for the line workers might not be feasible: expert networks are needed for resilience. © 2024

AB  - Up to date, workload and worker performance in Small Medium-sized Enterprise (SMEs) was assessed manually. KESAN (Kansei Engineering-based Sensor for Agroindustry) was developed as a tool to assess worker workload and performance. The latest prototype of KESAN was established. As the final step prior to the full-scale mass production, an industrial design was required and must be designed based on the validation to user needs. This research proposed an industrial design for mass production of KESAN using Kano model and Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The user needs was extracted from attributive analysis of Kano model. The matrix of House of Quality (HOQ) was utilized to connect the user needs and technical requirement. The research result validated Thirteen (13) user need attributes. The most important attribute was desktop application as an integrated decision support system. Fourteen (14) technical requirement attributes were identified to fulfil the user needs. Finally, a prototype was developed based on product final specification and prioritized technical requirements. The SMEs's manager could use the prototype for workplace environmental management. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - The coal mining industry is characterised by heavy workloads and exposure of workers to a large number of harmful and hazardous production factors in the course of their work activities. In this connection, the level of occupational injuries and occupational diseases remains at a high level, despite the improvement of labour protection and modernization of the working process. The purpose of this study is to assess the state of occupational safety in the coal industry by comparing the risks of injuries and occupational diseases. The paper analyzes the risks of injuries and occupational diseases for different coal mining regions of Russia, with special attention to the Kemerovo region (Kuzbass), as in this region the considered risks remain at an unacceptably high level. The novelty of the research findings lies in assessing the cumulative impact of injuries and occupational diseases in coal mining enterprises. The dependencies obtained showed that over time, the impact of occupational diseases of workers leads to an increase in the risk of injury. © 2022 Publishing house Mining book. All rights reserved.

AB  - In industry, skilled workers typically operate a specific set of machines; therefore, managers need to decide on the most efficient assignments for machines and workers. However, they also need to balance the workload among workers while meeting deadlines. In this research, the dual resource-constraint flexible job-shop scheduling problem with sequencing flexibility (DR-FJSPS) is formulated. The DR-FJSPS deals with decisions made regarding machines, worker assignments, and sequencing flexibility simultaneously in a flexible job-shop environment. Sequencing flexibility is studied in this paper, and precedence relationships of the operations are defined by a directed acyclic graph instead of the traditional linear order. The DR-FJSPS is modelled as a multi-objective problem to minimize conflicting objectives as makespan, maximal worker workload, and weighted tardiness. Due to the intractability of the DR-FJSPS, an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with an innovative operator is developed to solve this problem efficiently. The algorithm provides a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that decision-makers can use to evaluate trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Tailor-made instances are introduced to demonstrate the applicability of the model and algorithm. A multi-random-start local search algorithm is developed to assess the effectiveness of the adapted NSGA-II. In addition to that, the multi-objective model is solved using the weighted sum approach. A comparison of the solutions demonstrates that the modified NSGA-II provides a non-dominated efficient set in a reasonable length of time. The benefits of the proposed solution methods, such as defining their everyday schedules, adapting schedules according to management needs, prioritization of makespan, on-time deliveries, and workers’ workload simultaneously, are highlighted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The bin packing problem is one of the most fundamental optimization problems. Owing to its hardness as a combinatorial optimization problem class and its wide range of applications in different domains, different variations of the problem are emerged and many heuristics have been proposed for obtaining approximate solutions. In this paper, we solve a Multi-Level Bin Packing (MLBP) problem in the real make-to-order industry scenario. Existing solutions are not applicable to the problem due to: 1. the final packing may consist multiple levels of sub-packings; 2. the geometry shapes of objects as well as the packing constraints may be unknown. We design an automatic packing framework which extracts the packing knowledge from historical records to support packing without geometry shape and constraint information. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic programming approach to find the optimal solution for normal size problems; and a heuristic multi-level fuzzy-matching algorithm for large size problems. An inverted index is used to accelerate strategy search. The proposed auto packing framework has been deployed in Huawei Process & Engineering System to assist the packing engineers. It achieves a performance of accelerating the execution time of processing 5, 000 packing orders to about 8 minutes with an average successful packing rate as 80.54%, which releases at least 30% workloads of packing workers. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Qualified workers are becoming increasingly scarce in various industries in Europe. This also affects the labor-intensive assembly sector. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the availability of qualified workers during the selection and planning of assembly systems. This paper presents a procedure to assess the impact of the availability of workers with different qualifications in the simulation-based planning of assembly systems. An approach for representing the qualification of employees is selected and the implementation in the simulation is described. Additionally, a reference work plan is developed to compare different assembly organization forms. This plan is derived from analyzing work plans used in various companies and assembly forms. To represent typical scenarios related to the deployment of qualified workers, three simulation scenarios are analyzed for each assembly form. The evaluation of the simulation experiments takes into account the output and the workload of the workers as well as the task variety and the task identity in order to support prospective human-centered work design already in the planning phase. One key result is that group assembly shows greater flexibility potential than other forms of organization. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Precast concrete (PC) slabs are widely used in the assembly of concrete residential buildings. The PC slabs are manufactured at the factory and then arranged in stacks for transport to the construction site for assembly. Currently, optimization of the stacking plans for PC slabs focuses on yard-space utilization and transportation efficiency and rarely considers the assembly sequence; secondary sequencing of prefabricated elements is required during construction to meet the lifting scheme, which leads to increased construction preparation time and risk of worker injury. To enable stacking crews to generate stacking plans rapidly and systematically to improve the on-site lifting efficiency of the components, this paper proposes a storage-location allocation model with two objectives: reduce secondary-sorting workload and increase stacking stability for PC slabs. At the same time, it must match the characteristics of the problem. To prevent the solution from falling into the local optimum during the evolution of the particle swarm optimization algorithm, we introduce an elitist learning strategy, which can improve the solutions when the group converges. Finally, we verify our allocation model and optimization algorithm through example simulations. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional method, the stacking plans generated by this method have a lower secondary-sorting workload and higher stacking stability when using the same number of storage racks. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The production process of precast components is labor-intensive, involving various manual tasks. The physically demanding tasks usually result in fatigue and overexertion of workers, leading to increased occupational health risks and reduced productivity. An appropriate work-rest strategy is recognized to effectively promote both workers' health and productivity, while it has rarely been studied in the field of the construction industry. To narrow this gap, this study developed a mixed-integer linear programming approach to optimize the work-rest schedule by integrating workers' overexertion. The objective is to maximize the productive time affected by the workers' accumulative fatigue and recovery. Also, the optimized work-rest strategy can be highly customized by considering personalized factors and task characteristics. Experimenting with a case study compared the default rest schedule provided by the superintendent onsite with the optimal solution solved from the developed model. Results suggested that up to 20% improvement in productive time can be achieved, especially for the task with a relatively higher workload. Computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of total productive time to various personalized and task-specific factors. The proposed method provides superintendents with an applicable strategy to improve workers' productivity and reduce their occupational risks resulting from overexertion. This study can promote the implementation of personalized occupational health management and support the improvement of regulations on the required rest with quantified evidence, thereby contributing to more reliable scheduling and sustainable workforce development for the construction industry. The research scope was limited to the precast production process, and further investigation on broader applications will be conducted. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Exoskeletons (EXOs) are a promising wearable intervention to reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorder risks among construction workers. However, the adoption of EXOs may differ with demographic characteristics. Survey data (n = 361) were collected from construction industry stakeholders and a summation score method was used to summarize respondent's benefits and barriers to EXO use, along with perceptions and readiness to use. Responses were stratified by race (White vs. non-White), sex (male vs. female), and age (<47 years vs. ≥47 years). Both a higher Benefits score and a higher Perceptions score were significantly and positively associated with a higher Readiness to Use score. There were also significant differences in perceived barriers to EXO use by race and sex. These results demonstrate substantial interest in EXO use but also emphasize the need to ensure proportionate access to the potential benefits of EXO technology. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Recovery is necessary to maintain workers health and efficiency. Shift work has been associated with delayed recovery processes. The objective of this study was to examine the cardiovascular and self-reported recovery measures of German shift and day workers in the hotel and catering industry. Furthermore, it aimed to clarify to what extent shift groups differentiate given additional factors that influence recovery (ability to relax, lifestyle). The sample group consisted of 64 alternative shift workers (two-shift system with a low proportion of night work) and 96-day workers employed in the hotel and catering industry. Blood pressure monitoring was conducted for 24 hr during a working day, including the phases of work, leisure, and sleep, to assess cardiovascular reduction during leisure and sleep. The blood pressure status was measured over the course of a 4-day self-assessment period. Self-reported measures, including quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), work-life balance (WPC), ability to relax (FABA), and lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking, drinking), were assessed through questionnaires. Sixty-one participants (36%) were hypertensives. There were no significant effects of cardiovascular recovery regarding the reduction of blood pressure for the calculated differences between WORK LEISURE, WORK SLEEP, and LEISURE SLEEP among shift and day workers. Shift workers reported a significantly less favorable work-life balance (p = .017), a decreased ability to relax (p = .001), and less regular physical activity (p = .003). The workload within the two-shift system of the hotel and catering industry seems to have a lesser effect on cardiovascular means than on self-reported measures of recovery. The decisive factor is the ability to relax, which means psychological detachment from work. To enable a comprehensive recovery, an optimally designed recovery cycle is necessary for shift systems. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of virtual reality (VR) technologies in the industry has considerably increased in the last years aiming to digitalize, simulate, and optimize processes. However, although the industrial integration of VR has several technical benefits, it may deviate from real-world demands, potentially outperforming human capabilities. In industrial VR research, there is still a lack of awareness of human aspects, and technical aspects are prioritized over user needs. Consequently, large research gaps about the effect of VR systems on the human factor need to be filled in order to know and enhance the user’s well-being and experience. Hence, this research aims to investigate the effect of operating a haptic-enabled VR system for industrial assembly training on the mental workload experienced by new users. A random sample of ninety participants was selected to carry out virtual assembly training. Three sets of training durations were selected and evaluated separately: 1, 2, and 3 h. The mental workload was assessed in each of these training durations. The results have demonstrated that the training duration has a small effect on the workload experienced by new users during their first virtual assembly training. In addition, although the workload levels are not very high, females and males experience different workload levels. The research findings fill some of the existing research gaps and can be useful in promoting the long-term mental well-being of workers when implementing VR technologies in the industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Objectives. In health and safety at work, two main groups of causes of occupational accidents have been identified: unsafe conditions or technical factors; and the causes related to safe behavior or the human factor. The objective of this study is to analyze the predictive variables (emotional intelligence, personality, impulsivity and safety of the work environment) for three factors of the CONS-32 scale (criterion variables: use of protections, personal risk behavior and personal physical workload) in the construction sector. Methods. Using a sample of 256 Spanish workers from this sector, we analyzed the significant correlations between the three criterion variables and a set of variables extracted from various instruments, as well as the regression models that explain most of the variance. Results. The results show that the main predictive variables that explain the three factors are those related to responsibility as a personality trait, impulsivity and safety of the work environment. Conclusions. Based on the empirical evidence found, the most explanatory factor in all cases is safety climate in the work environment. © 2021 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study is to propose a model of job rotations in shoes (sandals and tennis shoes) production cells, aiming at reducing the risk exposure to work-related musculoskeletal disorders considering physical and psychological workloads. Methods: The physical load was assessed by the Occupational Repetitive Actions method, and the psychological load by the Job Stress Scale. A total of 259 workers in the footwear industry participated in this study. These loads were incorporated into a multi-objective mathematical programming model, where the objective functions aimed to minimize the maximum work-related musculoskeletal disorders and the maximum total work demand, and to maximize the minimum work control and social support to which a worker might be exposed during a daily journey. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature that physical and psychological aspects are considered when solving job rotation problems. To tackle the problem, we propose a matheuristic based on an epsilon-constraint framework. This method allows us to generate different solutions with respect to the specific objective functions. To assess the effectiveness of the solutions, we calculated the variance of the scores of the physical and psychological loads in the conditions without and with rotations. Results: Five rotation solutions were reached for the sandal production cells and twelve for the tennis shoe production cells. There was a reduction in the variation of physical and psychological loads in all solutions for both cells when compared to the no rotation condition. However, for the sandal production cells, the reduction in variation between the physical loads of the conditions with and without rotations was not significant due to the similarity of the exposure indices. Conclusions: The model reduces the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, promoting variability in muscle recruitment and enrichment of work content, being applicable in other segments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Construction is a heavy manual industry where working into later life can be a challenge. An interview study was conducted to explore workers' understanding of their health at work and ways of making their jobs easier, safer or more comfortable. Using purposive sampling, 80 trades' workers were selected from construction sites in the UK. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and Work Ability Index were used to explore aches and pains and reducing strain on the body. A high prevalence of symptoms was reported and ratings of work ability were high. Workers were aware of the physical demands of their work and had over 250 ideas around health and wellbeing e.g. rucksacks for tools, bespoke benches, adapting PPE, and higher cost solutions e.g. mechanical lifting aids. Engagement of the workforce should be encouraged and feed into change processes in the industry to enable all workers stay fit for work for longer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Virtual reality-based experiments were conducted to assess the impacts of environmental pollutants (i.e., noise, vibration, and dust) on work performance. In these experiments, concrete chipping work was performed in eight different exposure environments based on exposure to three environmental pollutants to measure data related to work performance: (i) work performance metrics, including work duration and accuracy; and (ii) mental workload. The relationships between data related to work performance and environmental pollutants were then analyzed using statistical techniques as follows: First, work duration was statistically significantly affected by dust, while work accuracy was significantly affected by vibration. Second, mental workload was statistically significantly affected by all three environmental pollutants, increasing with the number of environmental pollutants the workers exposed to. Third, all data related to work performance were found to be correlated with each other. These findings provide insights into improving work performance by managing environmental pollutants in the construction industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ergonomics can help manufacturing and industrial engineersmaximum work output without physical harm to workers.Physiology, biomechanics, anthropometrics, and allocation are the areas of ergonomics most useful to manufacturing in apllying the concept of Lean and Green in manufacturing. These systems require efficient production and low use of resources such as energy and material. Its philosophy encourage worker to look at waste. This concept is applied in one of national plant of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) that located in North Sumatera. The problem found in the company are the working posture and excessive workload of the workers. These conditions are affects to the their job performance. The study was carried out by evaluated the worker body position using the Work Posture Assesment (WPA) and Biomechanics method. The WPA results shows the operator's working position was mostly bent more than 30 degrees. This indicates that almost all workers are felt musculoskeletal disorders during work hours. While the biomechanics analysis found the significant relation between the values of Recommended Weight Limit (RWL) and Lifting Index (LI) which the increase of RWL value will decrease the LI value. This indicated that the recommended load for a worker under certain circumstances affects the appointment made so as not to contain the risk of spinal injury. In fact these condition are due to in-efficiency in production which can be maintaned the green design of CPO plant by improving the existing work. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) as an assistive technology is a promising tool for novice operators to learn assembly processes. This experiment compared an AR instruction method to display based electronic working instructions (EWI) for product assembly, to assess learning during the first repetitions of the products. In addition, two types of work instructions were used, i.e., standard and chunk instructions. In this experiment a chunk instruction consists of six assembly steps. Effects of the instruction method and type on the learning phase were evaluated with 24 novice operators building two products i.e.. Operators were then asked to build the same products without instructions in order to assess learned skills and establish effects on the recall phase, also as a result of instruction method and type. Task completion time (TCT), product quality, operator workload and learning curve were measured. The learning curve, as indicated by the TCT, took place during the first three repetitions of product assembly. Instruction method and instruction type had no effect on the learning curve. Product quality was high and no differences were found between learning conditions. Operator workload revealed that chunking of the instruction increased workload during the learning phase. During the recall phase, the AR group's TCT increased 19.2%, but only for the first product's repetition without instruction. Product quality remained the same during the recall phase, however operator workload was reduced for chunk learned products. This study indicates that chunking of instructions should be avoided for novice workers. Both EWI and AR can be used for teaching new assembly procedures. While AR and EWI are useful during the learning phase, there are indications that these methods might hinder the operator once they required the necessary skills and knowledge to assemble the product. A possible solution is making instructions more adaptive to fit the skill proficiency of the operator. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has drastically impacted workers and workplaces across the globe. It has totally changed the workplace environment and increased workers' concerns about economic insecurity, mental health and physical well-being, isolation, challenges of working remotely, and returning to the workplace safely. COVID-19 has also had an impact on job-related factors that affect the diversity and dynamic nature of the workplace. This study aims to identify the challenges and recommended strategies that management can implement to positively impact the health and safety of workers who construct and maintain transportation infrastructure. A through literature search that was performed to identify the challenges revealed that in addition to the factors like wages, hours of work, and access to paid leave, field workers are also facing increased risk of exposure to the virus, heavier workloads, etc. While most office workers are working remotely, factors like isolation, working patterns, technology, home situations, and concerns about job stability often contribute to anxiety, depression, and even suicide. The outcomes of this study will help the project managers and authorities in the transportation industry adopt effective strategies that will improve the health and safety of field and office employees during the pandemic. © ASCE

AB  - This paper presents a fused metric for the assessment of physical workload that can improve fatigue detection using a statistical visualization approach. The goal for considering this combined metric is to concisely reduce the number of variables acquired from multiple sensors. The sensor system gathers data from a heart rate monitor and accelerometers placed at different locations on the body including trunk, wrist, hip and ankle. Two common manufacturing tasks of manual material handling and small parts assembly were tested. Statistical process control was used to monitor the metrics for the workload state of the human body. A cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistical analysis was applied to each of the single metrics and the combined metric of heart rate reserve and acceleration (HRR∗ACC). The sensor data were transformed to linear profiles by using the CUSUM plot, which can be monitored by profile monitoring techniques. A significant variation between the lifting replications was observed for the combined metric in comparison to the single metrics, which is an important factor in selecting a fused metric. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the ability to detect different states (i.e., fatigue vs. non-fatigued) in the human body. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.

AB  - Instead of AI systems being foisted on workplaces and workers from the top down via a one-size-fits all approach, Sarah Fox, director of Carnegie Mellon University's Tech Solidarity Lab, investigates how more participative practices might enable staff to develop equitable workload procedures in conjunction with machine learning systems. How can businesses transform to incorporate AI without the nuances of mass redundancies and human supplication to such processes?. Copyright © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A general process of customization at the individual level is ongoing in several branches from the precision and personalized medicine (Duarte et al. 2016) to the individual financial and marketing methods (Matz, 2017). Risk assessment in manufacturing generally neglected the influence of the personal characteristics of the worker involved, strongly limiting the effectiveness of the risk based decision making. This paper is focused on the development of an innovative approach to explicitly take into account the individual characteristics of the operators (human factor) within the risk assessment in the work environment. Human factor is assessed with a set of tests applied during the working activity. The resulting method allowed the definition of a personalized risk assessment based on the individual skill and characteristics of each worker potentially involved (Human Capability) and the characteristics of the task (Workload). Preliminary results showed a relevant influence of human factor on the risk and consequently allowed the identification of area of intervention not highlighted within the more traditional risk assessment approach. First line of development is represented by a more detailed evaluation of the rules that manage the interaction between Human Capability and Workload. Promoting a more detailed analysis on the importance of the single index in relation to human error probability of occurrence would make the model more accurate. This could be done at level of the single task, identifying for any operations the variables (memory, dexterity, etc) more stressed and which are less solicited. Second line of development could be focused on the shifting from practical test to the most recent tools related to the individual physical performance monitoring and visual behavioural monitoring. This will allow a migration from a discontinuous to a continuous data collection with a consistent upgrade in term of representativeness of results. © ESREL 2021.

AB  - The construction industry is long perceived as physically demanding, and less consideration has been given to the mental well-being of the construction workers. The increasing number of mental health concerns urges the research to expand their focus from work health, safety and accident prevention to the “physio-social effects” on workers’ well-being. Hence, this research aims to explore the effect of work-related factors on the mental well-being of male and female construction workers. After a thorough literature review to set the background, a qualitative research approach was adopted as the methodology. Sixteen participants across two cases were interviewed, and the sample is an equal representation of male and female construction workers in Australia. Factors affecting mental well-being are recognised under five themes through the content analysis of the case study results, including the machoism characteristics of the industry culture; the high-risk and fast-paced work environment; financial stability and financial literacy; uneven workload and unconventionally long working hours; and the involvement of the employer’s management in reassuring the mental well-being. The key implication is that the same inherent machismo cultural characteristics of the Australian construction industry distinctly affect the mental well-being of male and female construction workers. The unpredictability of casual and contract-based appointments causes low job security and financial stability among male workers leading to financial stress. The current study emphasises that a one-stop approach to address the mental health issues of male and female construction workers is ineffective and proposes further in-depth research under the emerged themes of the research. © 2023, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

AB  - In the context of a remote collaboration task in virtual reality, this study aimed to analyze the effects of task distribution on the processing of spatial information and mental workload in spatial dialogs. Pairs of distant participants with specific roles (a guide and a manipulator) had to collaboratively move a virtual object in a plane factory mock-up. The displays allowed the participants to be immersed together in the virtual environment. We analyzed the dialogs that took place according to the frames of reference and the mental transformations required to produce the spatial statements. We also measured the associated mental workload. Results showed that when participants took a perspective, the manipulator’s point of view was preferred. Perspective-taking only yielded a moderate increase in mental rotations, which may explain a specifically high mental demand score for the guides’ NASA-TLX. Overall, this is in accordance with the least collaborative effort principle. This study reinforces the idea that, in collaboration, operators do not need the same aids as each other. Thus, it is not necessary to develop symmetrical tools, i.e., the same tools for all co-workers; instead, the needs of each operator should be taken into account, according to the task he has to perform. In our case, the guides would be helped with perspective-taking aids, while the manipulators would be helped with action-oriented tools. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - The adoption of lean model means a systematic implementation of various management practices. Such model presents the human element as a key factor in continuous improvement efforts, influencing workers' job content and work quality. However, there are few evidences regarding researches on quantitative assessment of the work demand, either psychological or physical, in a lean production environment. Therefore, this study aims to analyse from an ergonomics perspective the psychophysical demand and worker's perceived workload within assembly cells undergoing lean implementation. The proposed method integrates complementary concepts of widely known techniques, enabling the consolidation of several assessment criteria into one particular index for both psychological and physical demands. Such method is illustrated in a case study in an auto parts industry, whose application is performed in three assembly cells. Our findings show systemic gaps between work demand and employees' profile, indicating improvement opportunities in order to provide a better work environment.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration has become a hotspot in smart manufacturing, and it also has shown the potential for surface defect inspection. The robot can release workload, while human collaboration can help to recheck the uncertain defects. However, the human-robot collaboration-based defect inspection can be hardly realized unless some bottlenecks have been solved, and one of them is that the current methods cannot decide which samples to be rechecked, and the workers can only recheck all of the samples to improve inspection results. To overcome this problem and realize the human-robot collaboration-based surface defect inspection, a two-stage Transformer model with focal loss is proposed. The proposed method divides the traditional inspection process into detection and recognition, designs a collaboration rule to allow workers to collaborate and recheck the defects, and introduces the focal loss into the model to improve the recognition results. With these improvements, the proposed method can collaborate with workers by rechecking the defects and improve surface quality. The experimental results on the public dataset have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method, the accuracies are significantly improved by the human collaboration, which are 1.70%∼4.18%. Moreover, the proposed method has been implemented into a human-robot collaboration-based prototype to inspect the carton surface defects, and the results also verify the effectiveness. Meanwhile, the proposed method has a good ability for visualization to find the defect area, and it is also conducive to defect analysis and rechecking.  © 2023 by ASME.

AB  - Manual repair tasks in the industry of maintenance, repair, and overhaul require experience and object-specific information. Today, many of these repair tasks are still performed and documented with inefficient paper documents. Cognitive assistance systems have the potential to reduce costs, errors, and mental workload by providing all required information digitally. In this case study, we present an assistance system for object-specific repair tasks for turbine blades. The assistance system provides digital work instructions and uses augmented reality to display spatial information. In a user study with ten experienced metalworkers performing a familiar repair task, we compare time to task completion, subjective workload, and system usability of the new assistance system to their established paper-based workflow. All participants stated that they preferred the assistance system over the paper documents. The results of the study show that the manual repair task can be completed 21% faster and with a 26% lower perceived workload using the assistance system. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Companies in a variety of industries rely on their employees to work together effectively in teams to achieve their objectives. However, finding ways to encourage collaborative behavior to optimize a team's performance is often challenging. In particular, managers would like to be able to increase the likelihood that team members decide to help each other, in the event of workload imbalances. In this paper, a hybrid simulation (ABM-DES) model has been developed to investigate how workers' predisposition to altruistic tendencies, an important personality factor, influences their willingness to help their co-workers on a production task. Model inputs were derived from experimental data, including participants' personalities, perceptions, and decisions regarding whether or not to help team members complete a task. Simulation results suggest that highly altruistic individuals are more likely to help their co-workers. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - With the continuous development of science and technology, industrial production technology is also constantly developing, and production efficiency is also constantly improving. Greenhouse electric working robots are industrial production tools with automatic control technology as the core, which affects the quality of industrial products and thus affects the profitability of the factory. According to the set programming work, the greenhouse electric working robot can realize the reproduction production and reduce the workload of the workers. In today's era, the industrial production steps are more complicated, the production process is more flexible, and the robot's unchanging posture and movement cannot meet the needs of modern industry, which restricts the development of the factory. In order to better complete the work of industrial robots, it is necessary to study the geometric positioning and color recognition of industrial robots based on machine vision to improve the working efficiency of industrial robots. This paper established an active positioning machine vision system for precise positioning of robot parts greenhouse electric working stations. The matching method using image processing and feature recognition area based on the shape of the binding phase combines the threshold shape criterion to identify object features. The experiments prove that the method can quickly and accurately obtain the object boundaries and centroid calculations and identification data, the robot kinematics combined with real-Time motion control of the robot in order to eliminate this error, meet the requirements of the industrial robot self-Aligned. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the difficulties of countries and healthcare systems in preparing for major emergency situations. In the first month of the pandemic there was a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), thereby causing a rise in infection cases and deaths among healthcare workers (HCWs) in some countries. Moreover, the PPE used in hospitals today is not designed for prolonged use, and causes problems such as headaches and vision difficulties. To address these problems, a case study of an active PPE system for HCWs that is based on 3D printing and the use of ready-made parts is presented here. This case study demonstrates a new approach toward the design and manufacturing of PPE in emergency situations that relies on rapid development and domestic manufacturing of products through 3D printing technologies. The system was developed during the first months of the pandemic under restrictive quarantine conditions, and was fabricated and then tested by HCWs at several hospitals. Apart from sterilization difficulties, the system received positive feedback in user testing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - — Manual workstations play a critical role in flexible assembly lines by enabling human responses to reconfiguration that is faster than machine responses. As a result, human is more adaptive and sometimes unreplaceable by machines in complex assembly. However, with the increasing complexity of tasks, product quality has become highly susceptible to human error due to increments in operators’ cognitive load. One of the errors that affect assembly quality is the operator’s use of a handheld tool with an unfavorable working angle when handling the workpiece. In this case, an assistive mechanism to remind workers about the wrong working angle is necessary to support the process. To this end, this study proposes an angle monitoring system to inspect the working angle of handheld tools and provide feedback in real time with minimal interruption to the assembly process. The proposed system consists of an angle measurement model and an action recognition model, which are both built using deep-learning-based object detection algorithm. Besides, the system was designed with flexibility that it is applicable to different tools and assembly tasks. A case study on fastening a high-end graphical processing unit card is investigated to evaluate their performance. Results show 95.83% and 99.83% accuracies of the models. In practice, the proposed study is expected to facilitate assembly quality by preventing the failure of angle-related operations in a timely and reliable manner. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - Manufacturing challenges are increasing the demands for more agile and dexterous means of production. At the same time, these systems aim to maintain or even increase productivity. The challenges risen from these developments can be tackled through human–robot collaboration (HRC). HRC requires effective task distribution according to each party’s distinctive strengths, which is envisioned to generate synergetic effects. To enable a seamless collaboration, the human and robot require a mutual awareness, which is challenging, due to the human and robot “speaking” different languages as in analogue and digital. This challenge can be addressed by equipping the robot with a model of the human. Despite a range of models being available, data-driven models of the human are still at an early stage. For this purpose, this paper proposes an adaptive human sensor framework, which incorporates objective, subjective, and physiological metrics, as well as associated machine learning. Thus, it is envisioned to adapt to the uniqueness and dynamic nature of human behavior. To test the framework, a validation experiment was performed, including 18 participants, which aims to predict perceived workload during two scenarios, namely a manual and an HRC assembly task. Perceived workloads are described to have a substantial impact on a human operator’s task performance. Throughout the experiment, physiological data from an electroencephalogram (EEG), an electrocardiogram (ECG), and respiration sensor was collected and interpreted. For subjective metrics, the standardized NASA Task Load Index was used. Objective metrics included task completion time and number of errors/assistance requests. Overall, the framework revealed a promising potential towards an adaptive behavior, which is ultimately envisioned to enable a more effective HRC. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) account for a significant portion of worker illnesses and injuries, resulting in high costs and productivity losses to employers globally. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the use of exoskeleton technology to reduce rates of WMSDs in industrial worksites. Despite the potential of exoskeletons to mitigate the risks of WMSDs, the required steps to properly assess and implement the technology for industrial applications are not clear. This paper proposes a framework that can help organizations successfully evaluate and adopt industrial exoskeletons. Through a focus group of industry professionals, researchers, and exoskeleton experts, and by building on existing literature, an overarching adoption framework is developed. The identified stages and tasks within the framework enable an organization to evaluate and adopt exoskeletons through a systematic approach and to identify the existing gaps in their technology adoption process. The findings also highlight the areas where further studies are needed to promote the adoption of industrial exoskeletons, including large-scale field studies and long-term monitoring. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The physical tasks of workers are demanding, particularly when performed long-term in unsuitable working position, with high frequency, heavy load, after injury, with developing damage of health or reduced performance due to advanced age. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) result from overuse or develop over time. Work activities, which are frequent and repetitive, or activities with awkward postures, cause disorders that may be painful during work or at rest. There is a new technology in the market, occupational exoskeletons, which have the prerequisites for minimizing the negative consequences of workload on WMSDs. We provided pilot quantitative measurements of the ergonomic risk at one selected workplace in a Slovak automotive company with four different workers to prove our methodology using wearable wireless multi-sensor systems Captiv and Actigraph. At first, the test was performed in standard conditions without an exoskeleton. The unacceptable physical load was identified in considerable evaluated body areas—neck, hip, and shoulder. Next, the passive chair exoskeleton Chairless Chair 2.0 was used in trials as an ergonomic measure. Our intention was to determine whether an exoskeleton would be an effective tool for optimizing the workload in selected workplaces and whether the proposed unique quantitative measurement system would give reliable and quick results. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the significance of remote collaboration using virtual replicas, avatar, and gesture on a procedural task in industry; thus, we present a Virtual Reality (VR)/Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) remote collaboration system, BeHere, based on 3D virtual replicas and sharing gestures and avatar. BeHere enables a remote expert in VR to guide a local worker in real-time to complete a procedural task in the real-world. For the remote VR site, we construct a 3D virtual environment using virtual replicas, and the user can manipulate them by using gestures in an intuitive interaction and see their partners’ 3D virtual avatar. For the local site, we use SAR to enable the local worker to see instructions projected onto the real-world based on the shared virtual replicas and gestures. We conducted a formal user study to evaluate the prototype system in terms of performance, social presence, workload, and ranking and user preference. We found that the combination of visual cues of gestures, avatar, and virtual replicas plays a positive role in improving user experience, especially for remote VR users. More significantly, our study provides useful information and important design implications for further research on the use of gesture-, gaze- and avatar-based cues as well as virtual replicas in VR/AR remote collaboration on a procedural task in industry. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Autonomous operation has been one of the main concerns due to the advantage of excluding human error in industrial fields. In case of nuclear industry, some systems in nuclear power plants have been applied with automatic algorithms. However, the automatic systems cover only limited functions, thereby overall operational process is performed by human operators during startup or shutdown operation. In case of startup and shutdown operation, operating tasks are conducted by human operators manually. In addition, it takes more than 20 hours to finish the operation, thereby securing operation records for entire process is not easy. To overcome the problem, this paper suggests framework of autonomous system for startup and shutdown operation of nuclear power plants, employing a reinforcement learning algorithm. The system consists of two levels: supervisory and system operating modules. Supervisory operating module manages the overall operational flow. System operating module includes several modules that perform small operation units that operating tasks subdividing operating tasks into. Operating modules implement necessary operation using rule-based or reinforcement learning algorithms as needed. While completely autonomous system is both technically and legally challenging, it is expected that research on this area will support operators who might take high workload over long periods of operating time. Furthermore, it is hoped that optimal training method to achieve goals may contribute to improvement of nuclear power plant operation reliability. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.

AB  - Introduction: In the past decade, China has witnessed a significant surge in the popularity of food delivery apps, with its industry now thrice the size of the U.S, employing approximately 7 million drivers navigating urban landscapes on electric bikes and scooters. Predominantly, the market is governed by two main players: Meituan Dianping (backed by Tencent) and Ele.me (supported by Alibaba). Notably, stress and absenteeism stand out as significant challenges in this service sector, with implications for occupational health that translate into considerable costs for both healthcare systems and companies. Existing research has largely overlooked how job demands affect the mental health of food delivery workers in China, and how resilience plays a role in this process. The present study addresses this gap by examining the direct impact of Workload Volume and Pace on the mental health of these workers, and by exploring how personal resilience can mediate this relationship. Furthermore, it delves into the mediating role of Resilience, a personal strength, in this relationship. Methods: Using a correlational design with 206 participants, multiple regression analysis suggested a notable variance in Mental Health Decline. Results: Subsequent bootstrapping-mediated analysis confirmed resilience’s mediating role, highlighting its importance in managing stress from workload. Discussion: The results underscore the critical role of personal strengths in managing work-related stress, which can significantly impact both job performance and mental well-being. © 2024 Han.

AB  - Social distancing and wearing of the face masks are mandatory in all the workplaces since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. To guarantee workers' safety, it could be useful to analyze the influence of the face mask use on physiological parameters during working activities. This paper aims at collecting and comparing both objective and subjective measurements during lifting and moving a light load (3 kg) in two working conditions: with and without a N95 face mask. The recorded physiological measures are the cardiac and respiratory activity, the skin temperature and the muscular activation. They are synchronously collected via an integrated wearable and unobtrusive sensory system. Moreover, the Borg scale is used to estimate the perceived exertion of the participants during the execution of the working activity. The analysis carried out in this work pointed out some statistically significant differences in the physiological measures due to an increased physical workload experimented by the volunteers when wearing the face mask. In addition, the correlation between the Borg scale and the monitored physiological measurements does not change significantly in the two experimented conditions. Moreover, the strong correlation between perceived exertion and physiological parameters demonstrates that the Borg scale remains an excellent method for estimating the level of perceived strain. Finally, even though some physiological differences can occur when wearing a face mask, its usefulness as personal protective equipment remains undisputed. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In 2017, load limit values for manual material handling (MMH) tasks were confirmed to protect workers from low back disorders without prior validity investigation for Iranian workers. The present study investigated the applicability and feasibility of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (WISHA) lifting method as an occupational exposure limit (OEL) for the MMH tasks in a sample of young Iranian female workers using biomechanical and physiological criteria. A laboratory study was conducted with 10 female participants performing lifting tasks as described in the Iranian OEL for the MMH tasks based on the WISHA checklist. Each participant completed 21 lifting task combinations that varied in height and reach with the maximal allowable load. To test the applicability of the WISHA method, the maximum aerobic capacity and the equivalent heart rate (EHR) were estimated for 10 young Iranian female workers using an ergometer and Astrand protocol. Moreover, spinal loads for each lifting task were calculated using a static biomechanical model. From a physiological point of view, approximately 38% of the lifting tasks resulted in an increase in the physical workload. For 33% of the lifting trials, the estimated compression loads exceeded 3400 N. The findings revealed that the weight and lift height of the loads affected the lifting capacity of the participants. It seems that the allowable weight limits for manual lifting are not matched to the biomechanical and physiological capacities of the Iranian women. Therefore, the Iranian guideline for manual lifting is recommended to be revised based on the physiological and biomechanical capacities of the Iranian women. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The identification of fatigue status and early intervention to mitigate fatigue can reduce the risk of workplace injuries. Off-the-shelf wearable sensors capable of assessing multiple parameters are available. However, using numerous variables in the fatigue prediction model can elicit data issues. This study aimed at identifying the most relevant variables for measuring occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers by using common wearable sensor technologies, such as electrocardiogram and actigraphy sensors. Design/methodology/approach: Twenty-two individuals were assigned different task workloads in repeated sessions. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the most parsimonious fatigue prediction model. Heart rate variability measurements, standard deviation of NN intervals and power in the low-frequency range (LF) were considered for fatigue prediction. Fast Fourier transform and autoregressive (AR) analysis were employed as frequency domain analysis methods. Findings: The log-transformed LF obtained using AR analysis is preferred for daily fatigue management, whereas the standard deviation of normal-to-normal NN is useful in weekly fatigue management. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted with entry-level construction workers who are involved in manual material handling activities. The findings of this study are applicable to this group. Originality/value: This is the first study to investigate all major measures obtainable through electrocardiogram and actigraphy among current mainstream wearables for monitoring occupational fatigue in the construction industry. It contributes knowledge on the use of wearable technology for managing occupational fatigue among entry-level construction workers engaged in material handling activities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Autonomous operation has been one of the main concerns due to the advantage of excluding human error in industrial fields. In case of nuclear industry, some systems in nuclear power plants have been applied with automatic algorithms. However, the automatic systems cover only limited functions, thereby overall operational process is performed by human operators during startup or shutdown operation. In case of startup and shutdown operation, operating tasks are conducted by human operators manually. In addition, it takes more than 20 hours to finish the operation, thereby securing operation records for entire process is not easy. To overcome the problem, this paper suggests framework of autonomous system for startup and shutdown operation of nuclear power plants, employing a reinforcement learning algorithm. The system consists of two levels: supervisory and system operating modules. Supervisory operating module manages the overall operational flow. System operating module includes several modules that perform small operation units that operating tasks subdividing operating tasks into. Operating modules implement necessary operation using rule-based or reinforcement learning algorithms as needed. While completely autonomous system is both technically and legally challenging, it is expected that research on this area will support operators who might take high workload over long periods of operating time. Furthermore, it is hoped that optimal training method to achieve goals may contribute to improvement of nuclear power plant operation reliability.

AB  - In Indonesia, some industries do manual work using human labor. Among other things is the process of raw materials handling. Likewise, this happened to PT XYZ, which has not used a tool in the material handling process. The material are steel plates and wood plates. This study aims to determine the physical complaints felt by workers, determine the workload classification, and analyze the work posture of workers. In accordance with the results of the Nordic Body Map questionnaire, there are complaints from workers, especially pain in the upper neck, pain in the left and right shoulder, pain in the left upper and right upper arm, backpain, low back pain, left and right forearm pain, left-right wrist pain, and right and left hand pain. Based on Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) and Workplace Ergonomic Risk Assessment (WERA) analysis, all activities of carrying steel plates and wood plates are categorized as medium. Based on Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS), the elements of work that require immediate action are Taking Plate (Wood) and Carrying the Plate (Wood). The results of the calculation of energy consumption obtained by 5.94 kcal / minute and categorized as work heavy / heavy work (5.0 - 7.5 kcal / minute). Workers carr plates with a weight of 30 to 42 kg, while according to NIOSH Equation and Snook Table analysis the maximum load is 14.06 kg, so this is far beyond and dangerous. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Handling and packaging of heterogeneous products with different weights and sizes with optimal packaging schemes is a challenging task for the e-commerce industry. Furthermore, to keep the packaging process on a standardized level independent of the experience level of the employee, the demand of digital human-centered solutions is increasing. Against this background, two different digital assistance systems to indicate packaging order and scheme - Augmented Reality (AR) based data glasses and a LED based packaging assistant - were developed. In a laboratory study the interaction between human and both digital devices regarding subjective workload, usability, user experience, physical complaints and objective measurements was evaluated - with a conventional paper list as control group. Results indicate that both the AR and LED interface are appropriate solutions to assist warehouse workers in packaging. However, it can be supposed that the LED interface seems to be a better method in terms of physical and especially visual strains. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Construction workers are prone to physical and mental stress because of the characteristics of the construction industry. Researchers and practitioners agree that physical and mental stress should be proactively managed to mitigate their ill-effects which range from making errors to causing accidents and short term to long term illnesses. Accordingly, numerous research endeavors have pursued automated solutions for their monitoring to replace manual and subjective physical and mental stress monitoring. While these studies have been successful, they attempted to monitor either physical stress or mental stress at a time. Studies have shown that many times, construction workers are simultaneously exposed to both, physical and mental stress, necessitating automated simultaneous monitoring of physical and mental stress for more comprehensive workload evaluation. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the possibility of accurately monitoring physical and mental stress simultaneously using physiological measures and machine learning algorithms. For the purpose, experiments were conducted that comprised of physical and mental stress scenarios. The results showed that using 56 features derived from heart rate, skin temperature, breathing rate and skin conductance, an accuracy of 94.7% was achieved for simultaneous physical and mental stress monitoring. Additionally, the study further investigated the impact of varying the features and physiological measures and discussed the potential future work in this direction. Overall, this study for the first time, demonstrated that it is possible to simultaneously monitor physical and mental stress with high accuracy. Moreover, it has laid the foundation for future studies to enable simultaneous physical and mental stress monitoring on actual job sites. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several disruptions, necessitating adaptation to the current circumstances. The concept of the “New Normal” has been introduced to facilitate coexistence with the virus. Nevertheless, numerous industries saw significant impacts, both in terms of financial losses and personnel attrition. This development has a significant impact on the agriculture industry, particularly on field technicians (FTs). The present study seeks to understand the factors that influence the inclination to leave one’s job among field technicians. A purposive sampling strategy was used to choose fifty-three participants who were then requested to complete a survey-type questionnaire on various factors including perceived supervisor support, workload, perceived alternative jobs, perceived benefits, COVID-19, and job satisfaction. A SmartPLS structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that job satisfaction did not operate as a mediator in the relationship between turnover intention and its determinants, such as workload, supervisor support, benefits, and employment alternatives. Furthermore, this study verified that the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 epidemic did not influence the connection between job satisfaction and turnover intention. This study represents one of the initial investigations conducted on workers in the Philippine farm sector during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, the discoveries could be utilized to assess the distinct circumstances arising from the current global COVID-19 pandemic. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) has been effectively proposed as a tool to support workers in manual procedural tasks in industry, such as assembly and maintenance. It is very common for workers to deal with complete equipment in maintenance. Then, instructions may refer to components located in blind areas, i.e., visually occluded by part of the equipment. Displaying in-situ AR instructions in such blind areas requires handling occlusions; otherwise, side-by-side instructions can be exploited. In the literature, it is still unclear which solution better leverage workers’ performance in maintenance tasks accomplished in blind areas. Thus, we designed three AR presentation modes to convey maintenance instructions in a real machine: 3D in-situ rendered with X-ray technique; 3D side-by-side on a CAD model replicating the blind area; 2D side-by-side on a virtual mirror. We conducted a user study comparing these three presentation modes with a 2D drawing extracted from the original maintenance documentation of the machine. The performance of 42 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load. The results revealed that both in-situ and 3D side-by-side presentation modes perform better than 2D drawing. Specifically, the in-situ presentation mode outperforms the 3D side-by-side mode in terms of completion time. The side-by-side virtual mirror does not improve performance with respect to 2D drawing, then it needs to be redesigned for effective use in AR maintenance interfaces. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The application of hybrid seru manufacturing in real-world production often necessitates the implementation of a worker transfer strategy to overcome limitations in skill levels and realize the co-optimization of production efficiency and worker workload. Therefore, this study focuses on hybrid seru system scheduling considering worker transfer (HSSWT) to minimize both the makespan and the total labor time. The presence of multiple optimization objectives and coupled subproblems results in a considerably large search space, which poses challenges that existing optimization frameworks cannot effectively address. Thus, we propose a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive decomposition algorithm (RLADA) to address this issue. First, to minimize the search space, the HSSWT is decomposed into two subproblems, each utilizing distinct search strategies to explore specific areas. Elite-driven population evolution and a lower bound-guided greedy search are proposed to solve the individual subproblems. Second, a deep Q-network has been developed to adaptively select the subproblem to optimize in each generation by dynamically dividing the objective space. Finally, to narrow the search space, the lower bound is used to filter out unpromising solutions, thereby avoiding invalid searches. Additionally, the lower bound is utilized to determine the search depth according to the optimization margin, helping to conserve computing resources. Extensive comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the specialized designs, and the RLADA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution convergence and diversity when addressing the HSSWT. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The demanding work environment of the construction industry has spawned many studies on construction professionals’ experiences of work-to-family conflict. Relatively less attention has been placed on family-to-work conflict. Many employees in modern organizations play a role in both work and family domains and juggle between work and family responsibilities, underscoring the need to holistically understand work-family experiences of construction professionals. This study considered the bi-directional nature of work-family conflict and proposed an integrated research model to examine the work-family interface among South African construction professionals. Data (n = 864) were collected through an online survey administered to construction professionals registered with their respective statutory councils. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to test the research hypotheses. Within the work domain, work demands (i.e., work pressure and work hours) affect work-to-family conflict, both directly and indirectly, through the boundary-spanning demand of role blurring. Regarding workplace social support, only co-worker support is negatively associated with work-to-family conflict but not supervisor support. Within the family domain, the number of young children living at home and household task demands are positively associated with family-to-work conflict, while partner support is negatively associated with family-to-work conflict. Work-to-family conflict positively affects family-to-work conflict, but not the reverse. Work demands and role blurring experienced by professionals are likely to be affected by their job position and level of work authority. The findings suggest that organizations in the construction industry should protect their employees from experiencing excessive work-family conflict through creating a socially-supportive workplace environment, providing work-family programmes that foster greater boundary flexibility, and implementing effective work design characterised by reasonable workloads and work hours. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The emerging concept of Industry 5.0 has led industries to design industrial environments integrating robots to support human work. The impact of implementing human-robot interaction (HRI) on humans and the work-related stress linked to it is still an open issue. In this context, measuring mental stress is crucial for designing effective HRI environments. This study aims to experimentally test the influence of the robot's presence on mental stress by measuring humans' performance, physiological data, and workload perception. Sixty participants were asked to perform an assembly task while coexisting with a robot. Three scenarios were tested, changing the kind of task performed by the robot and the distance from the participants' working area. Statistical analyses were performed to capture the differences between scenarios. Results show that the robot's presence does not significantly affect the participants' stress levels. However, when the distance to the robot decreases, human performance is affected, concluding that the robot's proximity could cause more distraction to human workers. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Today's workplaces are transforming rapidly with the accelerating changes and developments in technology. Along with this the daily life of blue collar and white collar workers of industries are changing completely. Though there are improvements in the organizations, the condition of the work and the working environment of many workers remain laborious. This leads to an increase in accidents and health issues of the workers. It is utmost important and legitimate expectations of workers to address the health issues emerging out of their employment. Though there is an increasing amount of manual work being done by the machines, most of the Indian micro, small and medium enterprises are opting for manual labor for their industrial operations involving heavy physical and mental stress. Over time, the phase of technological change is greater than the worker's ability to adopt it both physically and mentally. Among the working people, most of the common illnesses results from people-work relationships. In this paper, the working positions and visual conditions of people in the workplace. The basic fact is that the people are different in their heights, ability to withstand physical and mental stress are different and this is the basis in designing the proper tools. The equipment and machinery should be designed properly for the use of people. The poor designs will cause people with lower back pain, muscle and joint pains. The objective of the paper is to estimate the physical and mental workload of workers in manual sorting jobs. In this work, two factors are considered, one is the height of the worktable and second one is the width of the pallet. A total of three scenarios are observed. The data obtained is analyzed with SPSS software and ANOVA is performed. The methodology and results are explained in the paper. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Several musculoskeletal-disorders (MSDs) complaints were identified in an industry of cassava noodle (Mi lethek industry). The complaints were caused by unsuitable work posture and excessive workload with repetitive frequency in long duration. The research objectives were: 1) to analyze ergonomic risk level for cassava noodle production system; 2) to provide recommendation for improving work method and minimizing MSDs risk. Worker ergonomic risk was measured using Occupational Repetitive Action (OCRA) based on technical action. The action considered strength, posture, repetition, addition, recovery, and duration factors. The OCRA output was an index indicating risk levelling and management. The result indicated that grinding station had the highest risk level of 6th level and OCRA index of 17.1 caused by power, posture, repetition, and recovery factors. The recommendation was developed based on improvement, ergonomic review, and training. The suggestion redesigned grinding tool with rotary blade as batter inverting device to minimize workload and to improve recovery time. The recommendations are expected to reduce the OCRA index to 6.0 or the minor risk level of 4th.  © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In the multi-variety and small-quantity manufacturing environment, changeover operation occurs frequently, and cooperative changeover method is often used as a way to shorten the changeover time and balance the workload. However, more workers and tasks will be affected by cooperative changeover. As such, the effectiveness of the cooperative changeover is dependent on other factors, such as the scope of cooperation and the proportion of newly introduced products. For this reason, this paper proposes a hybrid modeling method to support the simulation study of the production team's cooperative changeover strategies under various environments. Firstly, a hybrid simulation modeling method consisting of multi-agent systems and discrete events is introduced. Secondly, according to the scope of cooperation, this paper puts forward four kinds of cooperative changeover strategies. This paper also describes the cooperative line-changing behavior of operators. Finally, based on the changeover strategies, the proposed simulation method is applied to a production cell. Four production scenarios are considered according to the proportion of newly introduced part. The performance of various cooperative strategies in different production scenarios is simulated, and the statistical test results show that the optimal or satisfactory strategy can be determined in each production scenario. Additionally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed modeling method are verified. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Multi-tenancy is one of the important feature of cloud computing environment. Multi-tenant database system in SaaS (Software as a Service) deployed in cloud infrastructure has gained wide interest in both academics as well as industries, as it provides scalability and economic benefit for both cloud service provider and end users. However, low trust on the rented computational resources prevents users from utilizing the same. Further, in multitenant systems the communication channels and other computational resources are shared, inducing privacy and security issues. As tenants are anonymous in nature, a user may not find a trustworthy co-tenant and tenants depend on cloud service provider to assign trustworthy co-tenants. However, cloud service provider allows maximum co-tenancy irrespective of the behaviors of tenants to maximize resource utilization. Of late, a number of approaches have been presented based on reputation management mechanism to identify good and malicious tenants. However, state-of-art models are not efficient when behavior of malicious tenant changes rapidly. In order to overcome the said research challenge, this work presents a secure and efficient multi-tenant database management system (SEMTDBMS) for cloud computing environment. SEMTDBMS first analyzes security requirement of tenant workers and suggests a secureness weight metric for selection of tenant worker. Subsequently, a novel workload scheduler for scheduling workload among tenants has been presented. Experiments are conducted considering OLTP benchmark such as TPC-C and Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) benchmark with and without security compliances. SEMTDBMS show significant performance improvement in terms of latency and throughput over state-of-art model. © 2020, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.

AB  - U.S. dairy workers suffer occupational injuries and illnesses at rates higher than the national average. Occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS) have been proposed as a way to reduce injuries and illnesses for businesses of all types and sizes. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) On-Site Consultation Service provides assistance establishing an OHSMS to U.S. businesses. As part of this service, the consultants determine the level of OHSMS programming using the Safety and Health Program Assessment Worksheet (Revised OSHA Form 33). A total of 167 dairy industry records were obtained from OSHA. Forty-five of those records had both injury rate and OHSMS data. Using these records, a Spearman Rank-Order correlation was used to determine the strength and significance of the associations between prior injury rates and OSHA measured OHSMS programming level for dairy operations. Additional analyses were conducted to examine potential relationships between workforce size, injury rates, and OHSMS programming levels. There was a negative correlation between OHSMS programming level and injury rates, both for the overall OHSMS and by OHSMS component. Management Leadership was the OHSMS component most strongly associated with lower injury and illness rates. OHSMS interventions, as part of a comprehensive risk management approach for the U.S. dairy industry, may be warranted to help reduce the unacceptable number of injury and illnesses in the U.S. dairy industry. Further research is needed to determine if similar relationships between OHSMS programming and injury rates occur in other industries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to quantify musculoskeletal symptoms/pain and characterize the physical demands at work and outside of work among precast concrete workers. Direct heart rate (HR) measurements and self-reported activity levels were used to estimate the physical demands. A total of 27 precast construction workers participated in a survey, and 21 wore a HR monitor smart watch for seven days. The HR data were parsed in minutes associated with occupational and nonoccupational physical activity. Correlation analysis and multivariate regression models were conducted to assess the associations between direct measured physical activity with self-reported physical activity, body mass index (BMI), years of work, smoking, and Borg ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). Approximately half of the participants experienced musculoskeletal symptoms in the last seven days and moderate functional limitations in carrying out activities of daily living (ADLs). The regression model revealed a positive relationship between direct measured moderate occupational physical activity (OPA) and the Borg RPE. Furthermore, an inverse association was found with BMI, smoking status, and years of work. The workers accrued a median of 415 min of moderate OPA per week. The findings showed a high amount of moderate OPA minutes per week and musculoskeletal issues among the precast concrete workers. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the high workload, working within the healthcare industry can be quite demanding. This often results in high rates of absenteeism, unfulfilled vacancies, and voluntary turnover among healthcare workers. We expect that job autonomy is an important resource for work engagement and health of healthcare workers because it satisfies the basic need for autonomy. However, we propose that this relationship between job autonomy and work engagement and health can be explained by self-leadership. Self-leading individuals take initiative and responsibility and are assumed to use self-influencing strategies (e.g., goal setting, self-observation, creating natural rewards) as a way to improve motivation and general well-being. Employees from two healthcare organizations (N = 224 and N = 113) completed a questionnaire containing measures of job autonomy, work engagement, general health, and self-leadership. The hypothesized model was tested using a series of regressions, and the results confirmed the indirect relationships between job autonomy and work engagement and general health, respectively, through natural rewards strategies. The behavior-focused and cognitive self-leadership strategies were, as mediator, marginally significant: positively for work engagement and negatively for general health. Self-leadership behavior was not related with work engagement and general health. Implications of the findings for theory and practice on healthy healthcare workers are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 van Dorssen-Boog, de Jong, Veld and Van Vuuren.

AB  - Construction projects require long working hours where workers are subjected to intensive tasks such as hard manual labor, heavy weightlifting, and compulsive working postures. Among the physiological metrics, Heart Rate (HR) is reported to be a good indicator of physical stress and workload. HR forecasting models have been used in various areas including cardiopathy research, heart attack warning indicator, and early physical fatigue detection. However, there are no reported studies on HR modeling and forecasting in the construction field. Modeling and forecasting the HR of construction workers using construction field data is of paramount importance due to the direct relationship between activity level and HR. The objective of this study is to (1) analyze the effect of physiological factors including breathing rate, acceleration of torso movements, torso posture, and impulse load on the HR of construction workers, and (2) model and forecast one-minute ahead HR for construction workers based on their physical activity using deep learning algorithms. To this end, physiological metrics of five bridge maintenance workers performing several construction activities were collected. According to the Pearson correlation and entropy based mutual information analysis, time-lagged variables including acceleration of torso movements, torso posture, and impulse load have significant effect on the HR data. The results of deep learning models indicate that Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) have similar predictive performance. However, LSTM had the best overall performance in HR prediction with Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.4, 7.34, and 5.77%, respectively. These models have the potential to facilitate the mitigation of cardiovascular strain and enable proactive prevention of accidents in the construction industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human factor is considered as a cost effective alternative to expensive automated solutions, as well as an easily interchangeable high flexible resource. However, for many years the influence of human behavior on production system performance has been underestimated and a lot of unrealistic assumptions have been used to simplify the human component modeling. Nowadays, population aging is acknowledged as a global trend. Among individual factors impacting on workers' performance, high attention is being paid to the age from scientific community, policy-makers and business leaders. In this paper, demographic aspects and their implications on workforce composition are illustrated; successively, main findings on age-related performance characteristics are summarized. The authors propose an age-related model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is an integer programming model allowing for the maximization of the overall system performance jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. A numerical example is proposed. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mining industry has become one of the largest industries in Indonesia, now competing in billions dollar market, with numbers people employed. Deliveries of a Return Rolls (RR) involve the use of a hand truck and, in many cases, a shoulder/elbow-mode of carriage. Workers usually prefer to the Gendong (carrying on the small of the back or the hip, supported by the waist and arm) mode or Manggul (carrying on some stuff shoulder) mode, because they feel safer by carrying RR on the shoulder/elbow. In this study, the physiological workload involved in shoulder/elbow-mode carrying was investigated, especially focusing on the effects of load weight and inclination. To measure heart rate and oxygen uptake while carrying on the shoulder/elbow, a laboratory experiment was conducted and safety guidelines for such tasks were proposed, based on the experimental results. Four healthy male subjects performed shoulder/elbow-mode carrying, weight between 20 and 24 kg: (1) on inclination of 10o, (2) 20o and (3) 30o. The results showed that inclination involved an increased physiological burden, and that a load of 24 kg entailed a significantly higher physiological cost than carrying a load of 20 kg. Although shoulder/elbow-mode carrying has some advantages, the worker should be advised to carry a load of less than 20 kg, to avoid a high physiological load. During shoulder/elbow-mode carrying, it is also recommended that a person prepare more training in order to have muscular strength. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Construction workers typically undertake highly demanding physical tasks involving various types of stresses from awkward postures, using excessive force, highly repetitive actions, and excessive energy expenditure, which increases the likelihood of unsafe actions, productivity loss, and human errors. Biomechanical models have been developed to estimate joint loadings, which can help avoid strenuous physical exertion, potentially enhancing construction workforce productivity, safety, and well-being. However, the models used are mainly in 2D, or to predict static strength ignored their velocity and acceleration or using marker-based method for dynamic motion data collection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework for investigating the mechanical energy expenditure (MEE) of workers using a 3D biomechanical model based on computer vision-based techniques. Human 3D Pose Estimation algorithm based on 2D videos is applied to approximate the coordinates of human joints for working postures, and smart insoles are used to collect foot pressures and plantar accelerations, as input data for the biomechanical analyses. The results show a detailed MEE rate for the whole body, at which joints the maximum and minimum values were obtained to avoid excessive physical exertion. The proposed method can approximate the total daily MEE of construction tasks by summing the assumed cost of individual tasks (such as walking, lifting, and stooping), providing suggestions for the design of a daily workload that workers can sustain without developing cumulative fatigue. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dynamic cognitive performance has an impact on the safety and productivity of mine workers. Previous studies show that physiological measures have a good correlation with cognition during task execution. Observing the escalating demand for safe production in mines, it is now a crucial research area to examine the physiological variables that can predict cognitive performance prior to task allocation. In this experimental work, we have tried to predict how well participants will do on upcoming tasks using brain signals captured by electroencephalography. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 40 participants who subsequently took a cognitive test. After data analysis, our results show that EEG features can predict cognitive performance, with R = 0.48, p = 0.002, for the memory task and R = 0.546, p<0.001 for the attention task. This study also discussed the potential area of applicability in mining and some management strategies for dealing with workload and fatigue-related issues.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - We propose Knob, a practical active revocation scheme allowing to efficiently revoke users' access to encrypted data banks stored in public clouds. Knob leverages Trusted Execution Environments and All-or-Nothing Data Transforms in order to re-encrypt only small portions of the content directly in the cloud, using a scalable swarm of re-encryption workers. It prevents malicious users from being able to predict which portions of the files will be re-encrypted upon a revocation, effectively disabling pre-provisioning attacks. Our evaluation using industry workloads shows that Knob outperforms active revocation using full re-encryption by up to 3 orders of magnitude while being on average 3 to 7 times faster than state-of-the-art partial re-encryption. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Karasek's job demands-control (JDC) model posits that job control can buffer against the harmful effects of demands experienced by employees. A large volume of JDC research has obtained support for the main effects of demands and control, but not the interactive effects. Recent research on the challenge-hindrance stressors framework, however, found that work stressors may not always be deleterious, suggesting alternative hypotheses about the effects of demands and control. The present study therefore examined competing hypotheses concerning the effects of job demands on occupational health outcomes. Using a sample of 316 employees in a Chinese manufacturing company, we found that, consistent with the challenge-hindrance framework, production demands were challenge stressors associated with favourable outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction and psychological well-being). In addition, results showed that the interactive role of job control depended on the nature of outcome variables. Future recommendations and implications of findings are discussed. © Copyright 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The most significant factor in nuclear power plant operations is safety. A lot of people in the nuclear industry have continued their unremitting efforts. After Three Miles Island accident, human factors came out into the open that it greatly contributes to the course of the accident of nuclear power plants. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made to reduce the human factor error. As nuclear power plant design developed, a new type of digitalized main control rooms has appeared, the conventional paper-based procedures have been left behind as backup. In advanced main control rooms (MCRs), computerized procedure system (CPS) is used to support human operators. Applying computer-based procedures in the main control room allows to reduce mental workload, enhance situation awareness, and produce lower errors of omission than paper-based procedure. However, current CPS does not yet utilize artificial intelligence technology. In order to reduce human errors, the framework which detects unsafe acts of human operators is suggested. The unsafe acts (UAs) detecting system implements Coloured Petri Nets, and deep neural networks to determine if an operating action is an error. The system uses two steps of filters to discover the effect of an operating action on the plant integrity. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved

AB  - Production of karak at this point still has problems, especially from the aspect of production. Problem on production aspects include technology or equipment, continuity of production and uniform geometry. Karak mashing process is still done manually so its produced a dough that is less homogenous. While in the process of molding karak, the dough must be molded in the form of block and compacted, so that the force used when slicing will be even greater. During the process of slicing, the dough blocks sliced crosswise with a certain angle. It certainly affects the outcome karak pieces because the slicing is done manually. If workers have a arm tired then karak will decrease the quality, especially on uniform geometry. In this research, the production process changes that replace mashing by milling, molding replace with rolling and slicing replace with cutting to reduce the workload of employees. Consequences of changes in the production process that is required production technology to supports the new production process. Design of production technology has been tailored to the needs of producers and conditions of traditional karak industry. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - In the field of science and technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a very effective and promising instrument. Its ideas and uses are becoming more well-known across a range of sectors, including healthcare. AI has the potential to revolutionize several areas of the healthcare industry, including providers, payers, pharmaceutical firms, and regulatory processes within healthcare corporations. With an emphasis on choosing papers yielding significant insights, literature on this topic was painstakingly collected from a variety of sources. Assuring AI's smooth incorporation into ordinary clinical practice and evaluating its scalability for practical application are two of the biggest issues facing the technology in the healthcare industry. After analyzing the data, AI may be a helpful tool for healthcare workers, expanding their expertise and giving them more time to provide direct patient care while reducing their workload. In conclusion, it is feasible that the time of "traditional medicine"is coming sooner than expected, with patients first interacting with computers and then medical professionals © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Repetitive tasks in construction reduce workers' attentiveness of hazards on sites. This decline in attentiveness can be influenced by their situation awareness level. However, research on the relationship between attentiveness and situation awareness is scarce in the construction safety domain. This study employs eye-tracking techniques to investigate how visual attention changes due to variations in workers’ situation awareness levels. A virtual reality-based experiment was conducted to evaluate the situation awareness level of individual workers and examine its relationship with attentiveness towards different hazards using the situation awareness global assessment technique and linear regression analysis. The experimental findings reveal that the overall trend of allocating attention toward hazards declined over time. Furthermore, the attentiveness of workers varied depending on their situation awareness levels and the type of hazardous condition. Throughout the experiment, the group with a low situation awareness failed to sustain their vigilance toward hazards as effectively as the group with a high situation awareness. The outcomes of this study will help construction safety trainers understand variations in workers' vigilance behavior over time and, thus mitigate the risk of accidents owing to inattentiveness at job sites. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper formulates a non-linear integer programming model to solve a maintenance workforce sizing problem with a productivity improvement goal. This problem is modelled in a bi-objective framework that minimises the number of maintenance personnel while maximising their productivity levels. Inputs into the optimisation model include monthly and routine maintenance periods, volume of production, contingency maintenance time, use factor and priority factor among others. The model has been validated with real-life detergent factory data, demonstrating its potential usefulness. A principal novelty of the model is the inclusion of use factor, which captures how often maintenance technicians are busy on the job with respect to assigned tasks, including unanticipated high maintenance workload. The model has been solved using a branch and bound algorithm. The impact of workforce structure and workers' salaries on model's performance has been studied and sensitivity analysis carried out to investigate the changes to the optimal solution as a result of changes in the input data. The results show a reduction in the number of maintenance workforce personnel in comparing values with and without use factor in the model. The model's ability to obtain global optimal result depends on the value of the minimum routine maintenance time within each maintenance section. Also, the model is shown to be sensitive to priority factor, which captures the appropriate ratio of full- and part-time workers under the same category. The model provides both an easy-to-use practical tool for maintenance managers and supervisors as well as a scientific tool for determining optimal maintenance workforce size for a manufacturing plant. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The importance of standardizing processes is one of the basic principles of "Lean" practices, it reduces the workload for the Construction Industry. It is important, particularly because of its artisanal process in Mexico. We can ask ourselves, how to adapt the standard with Visual Lean Management of a steel reinforcement work process that is used in Housing in the Construction Industry in Mexico? This attempt is still in its infancy, that is, the vast majority of the processes are not standardized. The studied process is based on the Mexican competency standard ECO-351-Manufacture of structural elements with reinforcing steel, as a spearhead to standardize the processes, of the concepts in general of the construction, to close the entire work cycle of the work, this article aims to highlight the importance and promote standardization, always seeking continuous improvement of the process by the user, but with a visual management approach (VM), so that production workers understand it faster and easier; it was carried out through the cycle of continuous improvement of Deming (PDCA). © 2022 30th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2022.

AB  - Problems concerning occupational health and safety are commonly found in the construction industry, including falling of materials or people from height, stepping on objects and injuries by hand tools handling. Important factor in the occupational safety in construction industry is the use of scaffold. All scaffolds used in construction, renovation, repair (including painting and decorating), and demolition shall be erected, dismantled and maintained in accordance with safety procedure. Therefore, it is crucial to deal with scaffolds safety and risk assessment in construction industry; thus, way on doing assessment and liability of assessment seems to be essential for professionals. However, it is found that those professionals prone to heavily rely on their own experiences and knowledge on decision-making on risk assessment, lack a systematic approach and methodology to assess the reliability of the decisions. Methods: A Scaffold Use Risk Assessment Model (SURAM) has been developed for assessing risk levels as various construction process stages with various work trades. The SURAM is the result of research project realized at the above 60 construction sites, both in Poland and Portugal where 450 observations have been completed including both harmful physical and chemical factors, stress level, worker habits, as well as a hundreds ex-post reconstruction of construction accidents scenarios. Genetic modeling tool has been use for develop the SURAM. Results: Common types of trades, accidents, and accident causes have been explored, in addition to suitable risk assessment methods and criteria. We have found the initial worker stress level is more direct predictor for developing of the unsafe chain leading to the accident than the workload, and concentration of harmful factors at the workplace. Conclusions: The developed SURAM seems to be benefit for predicting high-risk construction activities and thus preventing accidents to occur, based on a set of historical accident data. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - Modern assembly systems adapt to the requirements of customised and short-lived products. As assembly tasks become increasingly complex and change rapidly, the cognitive load on employees increases. This leads to the use of assistance systems for manual assembly to detect and avoid human errors and thus ensure consistent product quality. Most of these systems promise to improve the production environment but have hardly been studied quantitatively so far. Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision have also not yet been fully exploited. This study aims to provide architectural, and implementational details of a state-of-the-art assembly assistance system based on an object detection model. The proposed architecture is intended to be representative of modern assistance systems. The error prevention potential is determined in a case study in which test subjects manually assemble a complex explosion-proof tubular lamp. The results show 51 % fewer assembly errors compared to a control group without assistance. Three of the four considered types of error classes have been reduced by at least 42 %. In particular, errors by omission are most likely to be prevented by the system. The reduction in the error rate is observed over the entire period of 30 consecutive product assemblies, comparing assisted and unassisted assembly. Furthermore, the recorded assembly data are found to be valuable regarding traceability and production improvement processes. © 2021 Production Engineering Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent advancements in wearable health devices equipped with biosensor systems (e.g., heart rate (HR) sensor) have provided an ample opportunity to continuously measure and understand workers' physical demands from construction work. Specifically, a relative measurement of physical demands, which is a percentage of HR reserve (%HRR), is convenient and useful by normalizing individual differences of HR. Since affordable HR monitoring using wearable devices (particularly, a comfortable wristband-type device: wristband hereafter) becomes available, %HRR-based physical demand measurement, which can be continuously calculated without interfering with workers' ongoing work, provides an enormous potential to protect workers' safety and health and to sustain expected productivity. This research investigates the usefulness of affordable %HRR-based physical demand measurement using a wristband from a case study of 19 workers in construction sites. The aim of the analysis is to examine the potential of this continuous measurement in capturing any significant physical demand variations, by investigating in-depth information on factors affecting physical demands (e.g., work tasks, individual and environmental factors). The results show that workers' physical demands are highly variable according to their working patterns (i.e., direct work, and indirect work including tool/equipment/material handling, traveling, and preparatory work), combined influences of work tasks, as well as individual and environmental factors (e.g., age and heat stress). These results demonstrate the need for continuous physical measurement during workers' ongoing work so that any significant high physical demands, which need to be avoided if possible, can be captured. The findings of this paper show that the continuous measurement of physical demands using a wristband provides rich information to understand, manage, and design physically demanding construction work (e.g., flexible work-rest cycle and managing demanding indirect work) by balancing workloads throughout a day and/or reducing unnecessary physical demands beyond direct work. By anticipating potential health and safety problems from excessive physical demands, as well as productivity loss before they occur, this research will have an ameliorative impact across the construction industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy-aware production scheduling is a promising way to adapt the factories’ energy consumption behavior to the volatile electricity prices in the demand response initiative of smart grids. However, it may not be economical by simply scheduling production loads to the periods with lower electricity prices, as these periods often have higher labor wage, e.g., nights and weekends. Based on this gap, this paper proposes a many-objective integrated energy- and labor-aware flexible job shop scheduling model. Many objectives refer to the number of optimization objectives surpasses three (i.e., five objectives: makespan, total energy cost, total labor cost, maximal workload, and total workload), whereas the existing energy-aware production scheduling research is limited within three objectives. To enable energy awareness in the conventional production scheduling algorithms, a state-based shop floor wide energy model is proposed. To enable labor awareness, the number and type of human workers are matched to the scheduled production loads, with varying labor wage over shifts. As one of the most complex shop floor configurations, the partial flexible job shop further considers job recirculation and operation sequence-dependent machine setup times. The recently-proposed nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is tailored for this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), including scheduling solution encoding and decoding, crossover, mutation, and solution evaluation using the energy- and labor-aware discrete-event simulation framework. Through numerical experiments under real-time pricing (RTP) and time-of-use pricing (ToUP), insights are statistically obtained on the relation among these five production objectives; the effectiveness and efficiency of NSGA-III in solving a MaOP are also demonstrated. This proposed scheduling method can be used to automated and enhance the decision making of factory managers in jointly allocating machine, human worker, and energy resources on the shop floor, such that the production cost is minimized even under time-varying electricity and labor prices. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the key interesting features of collaborative robotic applications is the potential to lighten the worker workload and potentiate better working conditions. Moreover, developing robotics applications that meets ergonomic criteria is not always a straightforward endeavor. We propose a framework to guide the safe design and conceptualization of ergonomic-driven collaborative robotics workstations. A multi-disciplinary approach involving robotics and ergonomics and human factors shaped this methodology that leads future engineers through the digital transformation of a manual assembly (with repetitive and hazardous operations) to a hybrid workstation, focusing on the physical ergonomic improvement. The framework follows four main steps, (i) the characterization of the initial condition, (ii) the risk assessment, (iii) the definition of requirements for a safe design, and (iv) the conceptualization of the hybrid workstation with all the normative implications it entails. We applied this methodology to a case study in an assembly workstation of a furniture manufacturing company. Results show that the methodology adopted sets an adequate foundation to accelerate the design and development of new human-centered collaborative robotic workstations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Fatigue in workers is a significant problem in the modern industry, largely because of high demand jobs, long duty periods, disruption of circadian rhythms, and accumulative sleep debt that are common in many industries. Fatigue is the end result of the integration of multiple factors such as time awake, time of day, and workload. It is known that fatigue has an association with work performance and increasing errors/accidents. This social and economic problem requires the full understanding of fatigue to its effective management at the workplace. In this work, we measure the regularity of the stride of human gait in a group of twelve people, in good health conditions. By means of an accelerometer placed on the hip, we recorded the acceleration values during the walk with and without fatigue. By means of the correlation of the strides, we measure its regularity. Our objective was to know how is affected the gait when a person is tired due to physical fatigue. We found that stride of human gait is affected when a person is fatigued. We conclude that physical fatigue can affect a person's normal gait. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - During human–machine collaboration in manufacturing activities, it is important to provide real-time annotations in the three-dimensional workspace for local workers who may lack relevant experience and knowledge. For example, in MR assembly, workers need to be alerted to avoid entering hazardous areas when manually replacing components. Recently, many researchers have explored various visual cues for expressing physical task progress information in the MR interface of intelligent systems. However, the relationship between the implantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D reconstruction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably. © 2023

AB  - Workers in the metal industry are using the equipment (hand tool) that produces vibrations. These vibrations have a negative effect on the fingers, forearm, or shoulder joints. Disorders that often arises is often called the effects of hand arm vibration. These effects vary of workers, ranging from finger whitened condition to the inability to move the finger. Lack of security and safety equipment will further enlarge this negative effect, because the disturbance will result in declining labor productivity. This study aims to model safety equipment in the form of fluidic damper to reduce glove hand arm vibration. This objective will be carried out in stages: 1) obtain field data on working conditions, workload with a hand tool and type of equipment used, 2) determine the parameters of vibration hand tool that is widely used, 3) modeling and making fluidic damper glove, perform the test comparison of the use and without the use of glove, 4) glove on field trials that have been surveyed. In the period of the study for 2 years, each parameter vibration hand tools frequently used can be measured in the laboratory. Tests conducted to determine the vibration of the arms that operate hand tools. Fluidic damper glove designed to dampen vibrations in the arm so that its effect on health problems can be reduced. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Virtual environments have been widely adopted for design and training tasks in the industrial domain. Low-cost automation (LCA) is a technology that automatizes some activities using mostly standard automation mechanisms available off the shelf. However, LCA systems should adapt to existing standard production lines and workstations. Thus, workers must customize standard LCA templates and perform adaptation and customization steps. This activity can be very time consuming with physical LCA systems, and in case of errors, it may be necessary to rebuild many parts from scratch. Thus, LCA systems would greatly benefit from a design and prototyping step experienced in a virtual simulation environment. An immersive virtual reality (IVR) application for rapid and easy prototyping of LCA solutions has been investigated in previous work; the assessment of the system usability proved that the users highly appreciated the proposed solutions. This research explores further improvements to exploit the existing IVR application as a training tool for LCA prototyping trainees. The proposed application now provides users with two different interaction paradigms based on the VIVE controllers and the Manus Prime II data gloves. The application’s interface has been revised to allow a proper comparison of the two interaction models. The two interfaces have been compared, involving 12 participants in an LCA building task. The System Usability Scale (SUS) and the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) questionnaires have been used to assess the usability and workload of the two solutions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Ergonomic rationalization of workplaces and the creation of optimal conditions for work performance have a positive impact on worker satisfaction, thereby enhancing efficiency and productivity at work and reducing employee turnover. Therefore, for manufacturing companies where human labor is the dominant factor, efficiency gains are very important for ergonomic rationalization. The trend in projection of layouts is using the simulation software to move from classical design to digital and virtual design. A great advantage of such applications is that, they allow creating visual space of workplace with taking into account the ergonomics requirements on workplaces already in the process of design. The article is focused on the application of simulation tools in the creation of the casting process model and the simulation of technological operations on the workplace of casting processing. The goal is to optimize the workplace layout in terms of ergonomics by using the Tecnomatix Jack software module and the Microsoft Kinect. Linking Tecnomatix Jack with Microsoft Kinect creates area for simulating work movements right at their performance. Creating a static model of the work position in Tecnomatix Jack and then placing a person in the digital model and moving it through Microsoft Kinect allow moving real worker movements into the virtual environment and evaluating the worker's current workload. The advantage of simulation modelling in the selected software is to propose an ergonomic design before the implementation phase, thereby avoiding back-ups and the need to make changes later, at a time when corrections are more complicated and costly. The results from realized ergonomics analyses were used to improve the ergonomic conditions of selected workplaces like casting and inspection of castings. © 2019 TANGER Ltd., Ostrava.

AB  - Even in hi-tech industries, physical workload is partly considerable and cannot be avoided because of product and process requirements. Especially in automotive, aviation, and marine industries, the assembly of the product geometry requires force exertions in ergonomically unfavorable conditions. Unfortunately, internationally accepted methods for the evaluation of those types of force exertions are rare. Besides some traditional German methods and EN 1005-3 hardly any evaluation methods exist. Even those methods refer to force exertions in primarily upright symmetric working postures. To overcome these problems the Assembly Specific Fore Atlas was created during the recent years. From a sample of automotive workers (n = 273), a set of 54 whole-body forces (6 main force directions while standing, sitting, kneeling; in an upward, bent, and overhead posture) and a set of 38 types of finger-hand forces (all at maximum voluntary contractions [MVC] levels) were measured in the field. The inputs for the types of force exertions required in practice were sampled from a consortium of major European car and truck companies. In addition, evaluation methods were developed that allow "calculating" maximum recommended force limits from the measured maximum static forces (i.e., MVC) and task and user group relevant parameters. This contribution gives a short overview on the data collected and focuses on the evaluation methods that had been realized. First, qualitative results are presented from the first field tests. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Intrusion is one of the most serious rule-breaking behaviors but it has been rarely seen in present studies since the existing manual safety observation can hardly obtain massive and complex intrusion related information effectively. This paper explores how weather and temperature impact on various kinds of intrusion behaviors on construction site. A location tracking technology combined with BIM (building information modeling) was applied for identifying and recording intrusion behaviors of 147 construction workers for 4 months. The results, empirically tested by ANOVA, show that weather, temperature, and temperature difference all have outstanding effects on both intrusion frequency and duration, however the interactive effects are not statistically significant. The analysis further indicates in good weather or uncomfortable temperature conditions, both intrusion frequency and duration are higher than those in other experiment conditions. Through on-site interviews, the corresponding reasons are found. Then recommendations to control this type of risk-taking behavior are proposed like the application of location-tracking technology, timely and targeted safety training, safe layout, and reasonable workload. The findings in this study also provide insights into the use of location tracking technology for intrusion management and safety improvement in the construction industry. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to improve workers’ postures and thus reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in human-robot collaboration by developing a novel model-free reinforcement learning method. Background: Human-robot collaboration has been a flourishing work configuration in recent years. Yet, it could lead to work-related musculoskeletal disorders if the collaborative tasks result in awkward postures for workers. Methods: The proposed approach follows two steps: first, a 3D human skeleton reconstruction method was adopted to calculate workers’ continuous awkward posture (CAP) score; second, an online gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithm was designed to dynamically improve workers’ CAP score by adjusting the positions and orientations of the robot end effector. Results: In an empirical experiment, the proposed approach can significantly improve the CAP scores of the participants during a human-robot collaboration task when compared with the scenarios where robot and participants worked together at a fixed position or at the individual elbow height. The questionnaire outcomes also showed that the working posture resulted from the proposed approach was preferred by the participants. Conclusion: The proposed model-free reinforcement learning method can learn the optimal worker postures without the need for specific biomechanical models. The data-driven nature of this method can make it adaptive to provide personalized optimal work posture. Application: The proposed method can be applied to improve the occupational safety in robot-implemented factories. Specifically, the personalized robot working positions and orientations can proactively reduce exposure to awkward postures that increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The algorithm can also reactively protect workers by reducing the workload in specific joints. © 2023, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - This article deals with how a human operator follows a request made by a robot in an industrial context. This robot is potentially myopic, i.e., its request could be based on partial and limited information. Therefore, it could possibly be faulty. This exploratory study aims to analyze whether multidimensional agent transparency may have an effect on two drivers of compliance identified in the literature: trust in signal and risk perception. In this experiment, we manipulated different agent transparency levels combined with two dimensions of agent transparency: robot-TO-human transparency (rTOh) and robot-OF-human transparency (rOFh). Results mainly show that adding rOFh to rTOh transparency changes human compliance with the agent and moderates both trust and risk perception. Moreover, task performance and completion time are shown to vary according to the different transparency levels. Our results show that transparency has no effect on mental workload. From a methodological perspective, this article shows the importance of distinguishing the different types of information about which a robot can be transparent, especially the combination of rTOh and rOFh transparencies. From a practical point of view, the article shows that the agent transparency framework needs to be considered carefully when designing human-robot teaming in the context of Industry 4.0 in the case of robots that may be unreliable due to their myopia.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This study investigates occupational stress among the South African construction workforce. The study focused on the task demands/stressors directly linked to the job a worker is performing. Task demands in relation to the type of occupation, job security, workload, and lack of innovation can result in low morale among the workforce. A combination of these factors results in job stress which affects employee’s mental health and subsequently their overall well-being. In this quantitative cross-sectional study, survey questionnaires were distributed among a convenient sample of contractors in South Africa. The study achieved 201 valid responses and the internal reliability was 0.777 and deemed acceptable. Convenience sampling was favoured due to the proximity of the respondents to the researcher and also, to speed up the data collection process due to the timeline of the study. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics methods in IBM SPSS v28. The findings of the study revealed that contrary to expectation, most workplaces promoted equality and had internal policies to prevent bullying, discrimination of race; sex and xenophobia, which are unique in South African. Further, workers received support from their organisations in relation to tasks, and adequate tools and equipment for tasks. However, workers identified some challenges relating to multi-tasking, strict work environment and job insecurity. Although these responses had received high agreement levels, they were not fully satisfactory indicting that they are still a problem to some degree. This study achieved the desired homogeneity in relation to the representation of worker groups. This study is important in appraising task stressors in the South African construction industry and how they compare to those in developed countries. Also, in determining similarities and differences, stakeholders will focus on specific aspects unique to South Africa. © 2023 by CITC-13.

AB  - The classical hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) only treats machines as the only resource constraint, ignoring the dominant role of workers in production and manufacturing. Considering the dual flexibility of machine and worker, this paper studies the multi-objective hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with dual resource constraints (DHFSP). Firstly, according to the characteristics of DHFSP and various constraints, the model is built to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan), total tardiness time and workload balance of worker. Then, an improved multi-objective memetic algorithm (IMOMA) is proposed to solve the DHFSP, which mainly includes the improvement of initial population, crossover, mutation and local search. In addition, Taguchi method is used to set parameters. Finally, through numerical experiments, IMOMA is compared with NSGA-II, MODE and MOMVO algorithms. The experimental results show that IMOMA can solve the multi-objective hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with dual resource constraints effectively. In terms of convergence, diversity and dominance of non-dominated solutions, IMOMA is significantly superior to other algorithms, but the distribution uniformity of non-dominated solutions of the four algorithms are not significantly different. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Workplace violence is a leading form of occupational injury and fatality, but has received little attention from the ergonomics research community. The paper reports findings from the 2012 New Zealand Workplace Violence Survey, and examines the workplace violence experience of 86 New Zealand organisations and the perceptions of occupational health and safety professionals from a systems perspective. Over 50% of respondents reported violence cases in their organisation, with perpetrators evenly split between co-workers and external sources such as patients. Highest reported levels of violence were observed for agriculture, forestry and construction sectors. Highest risk factor ratings were reported for interpersonal and organisational factors, notably interpersonal communication, time pressure and workloads, with lowest ratings for environmental factors. A range of violence prevention measures were reported, although most organisations relied on single control measures, suggesting unmanaged violence risks were common among the sample. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - The increase of safety and health monitor of workers has become a crucial objective to prevent excessive physical workloads, injuries, accidents and errors. Heart rate (HR) is a very important physiological indicator which could properly describe the workers' physical status. Recently, wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) wristband trackers have been utilized to measure HR without hindering normal gesture of workers. However, the quality of PPG signals is highly affected by human physical motions, resulting in a poor reliable HR estimation. Specifically, during different activities and gestures, PPG sensor contact pressures may have an impact on the quality of the heart rate signal. To approach the problem, an instrumented adjustable bracelet equipped with a PPG sensor and a load cell has been designed. A simple test protocol consisting of three different activities (i.e. walking, jogging and running) has been realized to test PPG signal quality. PPG sensor has been subjected to different skin-sensor contact interface conditions to take into account the effect of contact pressure. Preliminary results showed that a weak contact pressure results in a poor quality of PPG signal as the activity becomes more and more intense. These results suggest that the contact pressure exerted by the sensor affects both the arterial compliance and the arterial volume, providing different results. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Employees working in the hospitality industry are constantly exposed to occupational stressors that may lead employees into experiencing burnout syndrome. Research addressing the interactive effects of control, community and value congruence to alleviate the impact of workplace demands on experiencing burnout is relatively limited. The present study examined relationships among control, community and value congruence, workplace demands and the three components of burnout. A sample of 418 employees working in a variety of hospitality associations including restaurants and hotels in Spain were recruited. Moderation analyses and linear regressions analyzed the predictive power of control, community and value congruence as moderating variables. Results indicate that control, community and value congruence were successful buffers in the relationships between workplace demands and the burnout dimensions. The present findings offer suggestions for future research on potential moderating variables, as well as implications for reducing burnout among hospitality employees. © 2017, © 2017 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).

AB  - Welding, a key technology in the shipbuilding industry, is mostly performed by hand, owing to the complex structure and shape of production blocks. This manual welding requires a variety of working postures, which have become an important determinant of the worker’s workload and, consequently, assembly man-hours. Currently, major shipyards calculate welding man-hours by reflecting the welding factor, which is defined as the working time consumed in the welding process. A set of welding factors is known to be based on the accumulated experience in ship-yards, whereas the verification or derivation process for these factors is not disclosed or available. This study proposed a method for quantitatively calculating work difficulty for welding positions based on the working posture in a process where the posture acts as an important variable. Standard welding positions reflecting the actual welding work at shipyards were established. A physiological assessment method was used to propose the physical welding factor by analyzing the measured muscle activity. The validity of the proposed method was verified by comparing the results of a musculoskeletal simulation package and shipyard welding factors. The proposed method can be readily applied to other fields in which workers’ physical activities are involved. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - While Safety and Security Management System (SSMS) in the energy industry has recently improved in the last decades, it remains a hazardous working environment where fatalities and serious accidents still reoccur. Human Factors (HFs) and worker Safety-Related Behavior (S-RB) have been identified as the underlying causes of the majority of occurred accidents. Hence, this work aimed to identify those HFs which affect the SSMS from the most to the least significant, through the impact rate of these factors on workers S-RB at workplaces of twenty-one power plants (PPs), including Fossil Fuel Power Plants (FFPPs) and Onshore Wind Farms (OWFs) that are located across nine countries. Likewise, to give adequate countermeasures for the SSMS enhancement and accidents prevention. To do so, the data were collected through the survey questionnaire of a five-point Likert scale. The study has led us to conclude that, all the analyzed HFs have influenced the SSMS of all the evaluated PPs with an impact rate of 3.3/5 on Likert scale. Whereas the enhancement of the SSMS can be achieved if the job factors are improved and if the employees’ “Workload” is well managed at the workplace, as well as if the management clearly demonstrates their H&S commitment and leadership. © 2020 WITPress.

AB  - Labour is the single largest cost contributor and main limiting factor to development of the agricultural industry. Manual labour remains a major, essential factor for greenhouse-grown specialty crops. Furthermore, musculoskeletal injuries are prevalent during manual work processes performed in agricultural environments. This study aims to improve work efficiency and productivity and to identify tasks that can cause musculoskeletal injury. Working procedures were characterised using a work-study method, environmental conditions were recorded and a biomechanical analysis of the inspected task was conducted. An innovative measuring system was developed that enables synchronisation and analysis of the manufacturing, biomechanics, workload and environmental data. The study focused on the trellising and harvesting stages of pepper and tomato in greenhouses on two farms located in southwest Israel. We further conducted several experiments in which we changed the working method and assessed the effect on productivity. Another experiment was conducted to test the effect of three different trellising angles (30°, 60°, 90°) on labour and yield in tomato. The results revealed that in tomato, in comparison to current methods, picking 4 fruit per cycle will increase production rate by 17%, leaf removal from the fruit area will increase production rate by 14.4%-up to 40.2%-and the best trellising angle with respect to yield and labour will be 30°. Analysis of biomechanical risk showed that the maximum weight of lifted boxes should not exceed 12 kg, and when picking fruit growing low to the ground, the workers are exposed to medium to high risk of injury. © 2016 IAgrE.

AB  - Collaborative robots (cobots) could help humans in tasks that are mundane, dangerous or where direct human contact carries risk. Yet, the collaboration between humans and robots is severely limited by the aspects of the safety and comfort of human operators. In this paper, we outline the use of extended reality (XR) as a way to test and develop collaboration with robots. We focus on virtual reality (VR) in simulating collaboration scenarios and the use of cobot digital twins. This is specifically useful in situations that are difficult or even impossible to safely test in real life, such as dangerous scenarios. We describe using XR simulations as a means to evaluate collaboration with robots without putting humans at harm. We show how an XR setting enables combining human behavioral data, subjective self-reports, and biosignals signifying human comfort, stress and cognitive load during collaboration. Several works demonstrate XR can be used to train human operators and provide them with augmented reality (AR) interfaces to enhance their performance with robots. We also provide a first attempt at what could become the basis for a human–robot collaboration testing framework, specifically for designing and testing factors affecting human– robot collaboration. The use of XR has the potential to change the way we design and test cobots, and train cobot operators, in a range of applications: from industry, through healthcare, to space operations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The high productive times of the processes has led to the production costs within a company to increase. Due to this, many authors proposed the use of different tools that can solve this problem. This research proposes the use of tools as: autonomous maintenance, 5's, layout and industrial automation to improve the filling process of a bottled water company. The objective of this research is to increase the productive capacity of this process by reducing unproductive times and organizing the worker's position. To do this, several methods have been applied to find and select the best tools that can solve the causes that cause this problem. Accordingly, it was possible to design a solution that covers all the causes that reduce the productive capacity of the process. With the proposed design, it was possible to increase the OEE of the filling machine by 54.21%, reduce the rate of products delivered out of time by 37.54%, increase the efficiency of the machine by 19.16% and reduce the workload of the worker by 39.44%. At the end of the implementation, the model must be validated in the Arena simulator.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Fall from height (FFH) is the most significant cause of occupational fatalities in the construction industry, accounting for approximately 54% of all accidents. Such fatalities have decreased considerably due to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, the manual monitoring of compliance to PPE is complex and challenging for site managers. Automation in construction safety presents multiple solutions for monitoring safety at sites. In this study, a smart safety hook (SSH) monitoring method is proposed to eliminate the risk associated with FFH accidents by integrating computer vision [closed-circuit TV (CCTV)-imagery] and Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based [inertial measurement unit (IMU)IMU and altimeter] monitoring technologies. The proposed monitoring approach is validated through five real-time scenarios: (1) attached to the scaffolding and h>1.82 m (6 ft), (2) attached to the worker and h>1.82 m, (3) unattached and h>1.82 m, (4) h<1.82 m, and (5) outside of the risk zone. The proposed technique aims to relieve the site manager's or safety engineer's workload by smartly and instantaneously alerting of workers' unsafe behavior (via alarm, LED blinking, and bounding box on live camera feed). Moreover, the IoT-based hardware setup goes to low power to extend the battery life when there is no unsafe behavior. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution exhibits more than 98% accuracy for real-time detection and classification. Furthermore, it can be extended to monitor several workers and their location data in the future. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Enterprise knowledge workers have been overwhelmed by the growing rate of incoming data in recent years. In this paper, we present a recommendation system with the goal of helping knowledge workers in discovering useful new content. In particular, our system builds personalized user models based on file activities on enterprise network file servers. Our models use novel features that are derived from file metadata and user collaboration. Through extensive evaluation on real-world enterprise data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with high precision and recall values. Unfortunately, our experiments reveal that per-user models are unable to handle heavy workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a novel optimization technique, active feature-based model selection, that predicts the user models that should be applied on each test file. Such a technique can reduce the classification time per file by as much as 23 times without sacrificing accuracy. We also show how this technique can be extended to improve the scalability exponentially at marginal cost of prediction accuracy, e.g., we can gain 169 times faster performance on an average across all shares by sacrificing 4% of F-score. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The sense of touch and feel is an important asset to the human beings in all aspects across a variety of fields. For a long time, it has been almost impossible to mimic the sense of touch i.e. the natural feedback. Devices that had been developed have been based around piezo electric, Hall Effect sensors, and a combination of sensors and actuators to sense and replicate the feedback. To a certain extent, they have laid the foundation for the field of haptics. Haptics initially were limited to the vibrotactile responses, which were the ones commonly seen in the modern smartphone. Further research and development has led to it being closer than ever to mimic the sense of touch. Several devices were created by incorporating the field of haptics with existing design and devices. One such device is the Haptic glove. A haptic glove is a cutting-edge technology that allows human operators to physically feel the sensation of touch and force feedback when remotely controlling robots or other devices. These gloves are designed to mimic the sense of touch, allowing the operator to feel the shape, texture, and rigidity of the object they are manipulating through the robot. The use of haptic gloves in robotic teleoperation has been found to improve the precision and accuracy of remote tasks, as well as reducing the cognitive load on the operator. This technology can be adopted in field such as manufacturing, surgery, and space exploration. For example, in manufacturing, haptic gloves can be used to remotely operate machinery or perform inspections on hard-to-reach areas, while in surgery; haptic gloves can enable surgeons to perform remote surgeries with greater precision and control. In space exploration, haptic gloves can be used to remotely control robots for tasks such as sample collection and maintenance. Future developments in haptic technology could lead to even more advanced and realistic haptic feedback, further enhancing the capabilities of robotic teleoperation.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the E-LEG, a novel semi-passive lower-limb exoskeleton for worker squatting assistance, with motorized tuning of the assistive squatting height. Compared with other passive industrial exoskeletons for the lower-limbs, the E-LEG presents novel design features namely inertial sensor for measuring the tilt angle of thigh and the novel electromagnetic switch for adjusting squat height. These features could enhance the effectiveness of the system. In addition to the introduction to exoskeleton design, this paper also reports the systematic experimental evaluation of human subjects. With the assistance of different conditions, the variability of muscular activity was evaluated in long-term static squatting task. The set of metrics to evaluate the effect of the device included leg muscle activity, plantar pressure fluctuation, plantar pressure center fluctuation and gait angles. Results show that the exoskeleton can reduce the muscular activity of the user during squatting, and it will have little affect the normal gait of the user during walking. In this study, we found that the E-LEG exoskeleton has potential effectiveness in reducing the muscular strain on long-term continuous squatting activities.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - This two-study paper presents why and how work overload and insomnia can relate to workplace injuries in service companies serving the offshore and onshore oil and gas industry. Utilizing the self-regulatory resource theory, we argue that both overload and insomnia decrease workers' safety behaviors, resulting in increased workplace injuries. Moreover, in order to ultimately derive organizational interventions to alleviate the detrimental impact of insomnia on workplace injuries, we propose that supervisor safety priority can create situation strength that can prevent workers from behaving unsafely despite experiencing high workload and insomnia. We present two studies testing the insomnia-safety outcome and overload-safety outcome relationships respectively. Results were consistent with the proposed conceptual framework, the relationship between insomnia and injuries is explained by the influence of insomnia on safety behaviors, and the relationship between overload and outcomes was also alleviated through situation strength. For employees supervised by supervisors with high safety priority, both the relationship between insomnia and safety behaviors and the indirect relationship between insomnia and workplace injuries were weaker. We propose theoretical implications for future safety research and suggest tentative directions for practitioners working to reduce workplace injuries through work overload and sleep-oriented interventions.

AB  - Construction 4.0, derived from Industry 4.0, was introduced to the construction industry as a means of addressing current issues and enhancing industry productivity. Adoption of this concept has placed a significant demand on Construction 4.0 skills, as the industry is undergoing a transformation that calls for new strategies and specialized skill sets. While Construction 4.0 promises significant productivity gains, its widespread adoption often overlooks the crucial role of specialized skills, leading to a mismatch in expected outcomes. The often-underexplored theoretical dimensions of Construction 4.0 skills has the potential to bridge the gap between these skills and formulation of productivity goals and achieving them, highlighting the profound importance of understanding and integrating these skills in the context of Construction 4.0. While there has been a recent interest in Construction 4.0 skills across various national contexts, the theoretical dimensions of skills within the realm of Construction 4.0 remains unexplored. Therefore, this study examines the definitions, interpretations, and theories of skills within the context of Construction 4.0. Through a conceptual review of existing academic literature and policy documents, this research offers profound understanding of defintions and how the theories of Construction 4.0 intersect with skills development and thus impact the formulation of productivity goals. The definitions of Industry 4.0/Construction 4.0 formulated in various national frameworks are defined in accordance with their geographical, social, and cultural contexts and that have distinct production aims and scopes. The identified theoretical underpinnings of Construction 4.0 include digital building ecosystem, lean construction, circular economy, smart cities, and skills-related theories such as social learning theory, human capital theory, cognitive load theory, situated learning theory, and lifelong learning theory. The examination brings forth novel insights that promise to shape the future of Construction 4.0 skills development. By bridging the gap between theoretical constructs and productivity goals (labour efficiency, process efficiency, time efficiency, waste reduction, energy and water efficiency) within the context of Construction 4.0, this study offers a fresh perspective that integrates technology, sustainability, and collaboration to propel productivity goals. The research also emphasizes the varying prioritization of Construction 4.0 skill sets in different national contexts, and underscores the need for sector-specific frameworks for Construction 4.0 skills. Moreover, potential avenues for future research in the field of Construction 4.0 skills include perspectives of workers, real-world impacts on the industry, policy advancements, skills frameworks, ethical evaluations, and scenario planning. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This study evaluates the potential industrial working environment of the Pempek & Kemplang Palembang. Observation of the work environment found a lot of un-ergonomics impact that has not optimal productivity and exceeds the threshold value of aspects of human health. In order to optimize productivity, the production line is required to work quickly in an ECSHE (Effective, Comfortable, Safety, Health, Efficient) ergonomics for workers. Evaluate the work environment by implementing Ergonomics Checkpoints to see whether the working environment has been running well or not. Ergonomics Checkpoints used in this study include material handling aspects, safety, workstation design, lighting, development of human resources and sources of danger contribute to the value of most incompatibility which becomes the top priority in determining suggestions for improvement. While the Total Ergonomics intervention study includes; work posture, un-ergonomics design tools, un-physiological work, classification of subjectivity level of musculoskeletal system is 55-76 (high risk), classification of subjectivity level of fatigue is 66-79 (high category), physical workload at workload level is 125-150 bpm (weight category), and the %CVL category is 78-85% (rather heavy). To be more holistic the 5S method and participatory training in human resources are also used as a method of evaluating the work environment in this industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This pilot study assessed work-related acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, identified how workers deal with musculoskeletal pain and recognized work-related factors associated with musculoskeletal pain in 23 commercial construction workers. Workers answered a survey about musculoskeletal pain, pain severity, functional limitations, and perceived exertion at work (Borg RPE scale). Eighty-six percent reported acute musculoskeletal pain and 24% chronic pain in the last 12 months. Among those reporting acute pain, 67% sought treatment from a healthcare professional, 64% had prescribed medication, and 39% modified their work habits to handle pain at work. About 80% of the workers reporting chronic pain sought healthcare treatment, had prescribed medication, and modified their work habits to manage pain. Almost 60% of the participants experienced pain in the last seven days. Among them, 46% reported moderate pain in their legs or knees, 31% in their low back, and 23% severe pain in their arms, shoulders, or hands. The assessment of the functional limitations indicated they experienced moderate to severe limitations in performing activities of daily living (ADLs). The logistic regression models suggested a direct relationship between workers’ work physical exertion and their Body Mass Index (BMI) with the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain. Construction workers are dealing with acute and chronic pain at work that negatively impacts their work and ADLs. Work-related and individual factors such as work physical exertion and BMI seem to play a significant role in the presence of acute and chronic pain associated with MSDs. This study’s findings can help guide sustainable ergonomic interventions and future research to alleviate acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain while promoting workers’ health and wellbeing in the construction industry. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In the past decade, there has been a boom in the volume of data and in the popularity of cloud applications with industry and academia keenly interested in big data analytics, streaming application, and social networking applications. This led to the emergence of real-time distributed stream processing systems such as Flink, Storm, Dataflow, and Samza. These systems process complex queries on streaming data sets to be distributed across multiple worker nodes in a cluster. Few of them provide adequate supports to adapt the topologies of stream processing tasks to changing input workload. We present an intelligent and efficient topology adjustment scheme which allow Flink framework to refine its topology on the basis of incoming workload. It is designed to increase the overall performance by making the refining of topology robust according to incoming workload streams on the fly, while maintaining SLA constraints. Apache Flink distributed processing engine is used as testbed in the paper. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed system outperforms the existing default framework. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - An immersive Augmented Reality (AR) technology enhances productivity and flexibility in manufacturing by providing real-time instructions within workers’ field of view, aiding in complex tasks. According to cognitive load and attention-based theories, AR guidance can reduce cognitive strain, enhancing task performance. The affordance of AR in industrial processes like assembly or disassembly for repair/maintenance has been exploited broadly. However, the prevailing studies on automated user interfaces for AR instruction development, specifically virtual scene creation and target generation for object mapping rendering, still need to be explored. Notably, production industries currently rely on outsourcing skilled professionals to create AR overlaying instructions using manufacturer input. However, the exactness of the disassembly repository is substantial to avoid defects in AR guidance particulars. This underscores the significance of generalized automated AR instruction development and emphasizes the demands for further research. In this work, the autonomous AR-integrated framework is developed for the disassembly context, empowering manufacturers to acquire desired outcomes across various modules. These modules include the validation of the manual user disassembly sequence repository during the prefatory phase of AR instruction creation and the provision of Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) input. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation/rendering of disassembly efforts in a virtual platform and the generation of rendering virtual display scenes for appropriate AR-guided object mapping. Furthermore, it enables the generation of essential model targets for registering the AR scenes. Subsequently, the extracted repositories (virtual scenes and model targets) are input into the Unity AR tool to create AR mapping guidance for disassembly operations. The performance of the autonomous disassembly module is evaluated through three case studies with different AR visualizations. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed framework is exploited by extracting feedback from experts regarding flexibility, compatibility, completion time, and cognitive level. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This electronic document is a 'livUsing OCR technology to automatically recognize identification characters will greatly reduce people's workload and improve work efficiency. However, in the case of low contrast between background and characters, traditional OCR technology has poor anti-interference ability and low recognition accuracy. This article proposes a printing character quality inspection algorithm based on AlexNet. The quality inspection process includes multiple steps such as image acquisition, image preprocessing, feature extraction, classification recognition, and quality inspection. In the design of fuzzy character recognition software, a graphical interaction interface is developed using the Python Tkinter module, and a character recognition system is designed, including a character recognition module and an information storage and query module, to enhance the human-machine interaction ability of the system and facilitate product sourcing and management. The experimental results show that the model in this paper can achieve recognition accuracy of 96.1%, and the recognition time for individual item characters is 0.29 seconds. The AlexNet model proposed in this article has better performance of printed character recognition than that of CNN and RNN models. The experimental conclusion of this article can be used for character recognition and quality inspection in the tobacco industry.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The construction industry is hazardous, which requires careful consideration of occupational health and safety measures. Among various strategies that are proposed to enhance construction safety, Lean construction practices were widely implied and proved to be effective. However, the link between Lean implementation and construction safety has not been completely studied yet in previous research in terms of psychological safety context. This study implies that psychological safety is of utmost importance in terms of explaining the association between Lean and safety. Lean implementation elements such as respect for people, trust, leadership, and continuous improvement positively affect employees’ psychological safety. In this context, semi-structured interviews and a survey were conducted with employees working in U.S. construction companies. The interviews provided that the majority of the construction employees do not feel psychologically safe at their workplaces either in traditional or Lean construction projects due to a number of reasons such as heavy workload, and deadline pressures. However, it was found that construction workers feel safer psychologically in Lean construction projects compared to traditional projects. According to the interview results and literature review, a conceptual model was proposed. Therefore, this study can contribute to the research area of psychological safety in the construction industry. © 2021 by the author(s).

AB  - Risk assessment is the process of identifying and evaluating risks or hazards. It serves as the main component in an effective safety management system, as well as in accident prevention and control. In Malaysia, the existing hazard identification, risk assessment, and risk control frameworks have been established to promote and motivate the industry in the implementation of a risk management system. In this paper, seven human risk factors were analyzed using the modified risk calculation method by introducing Frequency and existing control measures in the calculation. Based on the risk calculated, it was found that there were two risk factors in the significant category, which were human carelessness and omissions (R3), and worker’s individual experience (R7). Meanwhile, operators’ mistakes and faults on operations (R1), communication misunderstandings (R2), and execution of the job safety rules and regulations (R4) were in the moderate category. Worker’s individual workload and stress (R5) and worker’s individual discipline (R6) were in the acceptable category. The new risk matrix was also introduced, whereby the recommendation risk control shall be made based on its category. Based on the new risk calculation method suggested, the modified risk calculation method should help the organization do better decision-making, and prioritize the risks based on the risk category suggested. © IAEME Publication

AB  - The Chinese express delivery industry processes nearly 110 billion items in 2022, averaging an annual growth rate of 200%. Among the various types of sorting systems used for handling express items, cross-belt sorting systems stand out as the most crucial. However, despite their high degree of automation, the workload for operators has intensified owing to the surging volume of express items. In the era of Industry 5.0, it is imperative to adopt new technologies that not only enhance worker welfare but also improve the efficiency of cross-belt systems. Striking a balance between efficiency in handling express items and operator well-being is challenging. Digital twin technology offers a promising solution in this respect. A realization method of a human–machine integrated digital twin is proposed in this study, enabling the interaction of biological human bodies, virtual human bodies, virtual equipment, and logistics equipment in a closed loop, thus setting an operating framework. Key technologies in the proposed framework include a collection of heterogeneous data from multiple sources, construction of the relationship between operator fatigue and operation efficiency based on physiological measurements, virtual model construction, and an online optimization module based on real-time simulation. The feasibility of the proposed method was verified in an express distribution center. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Human-robot collaboration promises to free the human to multitask and engage in cognitive work while the robots assists with physical tasks, therefore increasing productivity. However, this collaborative paradigm requires continuous attention from human operators, which could potentially strain their cognitive resources. Excessive attention demands can lead to safety hazards, increased errors, and reduced efficiency. Despite its critical importance, there is limited empirical research on attentional factors in industrial human-robot collaboration. In this study, we explore attentional multitasking in collaborative human-robot assembly settings. Our experimental setup involves participants performing a wire harnessing task with a collaborative robot while simultaneously completing a Go/No-Go test as a secondary task. To observe the effect of multitasking, we varied the difficulty of the secondary task across two levels and analysed its impacts on work performance and workload. Our results confirm threaded cognition theory, suggesting that human-robot collaboration could reduce cognitive capacity by depleting attentional resources, leading to higher errors and cycle times during multitasking. This underscores the importance of a detailed understanding of attentional factors in human-robot collaboration. We discuss our findings and their implications, and provide insights into the adjustment and design of human-robot collaboration tasks in the industry.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - A novel platform for remote collaboration is proposed in this paper. This platform makes it possible for an expert to assist a worker for industrial assembly task in different places. Our goal is to compare the effect of sharing head pointer in a SAR remote collaboration with AR annotations in manufacturing. First, we develop an AR remote collaborative platform. This platform implements sharing a remote expert’s head pointer instead of eye gaze. Then, we evaluate the prototype system comparing two conditions through a user study, AR annotations and gaze cues (GC), relating to their effectiveness in the assembly efficiency, numbers of incorrect operation, workload, and collaborative experience. The results show that sharing head pointer can improve performance, co-presence awareness, and user collaborative experiences and decreases the numbers of incorrect operations. More importantly, we implement GC visualization in low-cost head tracking and find that it acts as a good referential pointing. Therefore, head pointer could be a competent representation of GC in AR/MR remote collaboration for assembly assistance. Our research has a great practical significance for the industrial application of GC-based AR/MR remote collaboration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, an intelligent incentive model based on environmental ergonomics in food small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was developed. Environmental ergonomics was defined as the impact of temperature and relative humidity within a certain range on a worker’s heart rate during work. Optimum environmental ergonomics are highly required as a basic standard for food SMEs to provide fair incentives. Recommendable parameters from a genetic algorithm and fuzzy inference modeling were used to model customized incentives based on optimum heart rate, workplace temperature and relative humidity before and after working. The research hypothesis stated that industries should optimize their workload and workstation environment prior to customizing incentives. The research objectives were: 1) to recommend optimum environmental ergonomics parameters for customized incentives; 2) to determine the incentives at workstations of SMEs based on optimum environmental ergonomics parameters and fuzzy inference modeling. The optimum values for heart rate, workstation temperature and relative humidity used were based on recommendable values from the genetic algorithm. An inference model was developed to generate decisions whether a worker should receive an incentive based on a calculated index. The results indicated that 84.4% of workers should receive an incentive. The results of this research could be used to promote the concept of ergonomics-based customized incentives. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - The aquaculture industry has rapidly grown over the year. One pertinent aspect is the ability of the aquaculture farm management to accurately count the fish populations to provide effective feeding and the control of breeding density. The current practice of counting the fish manually increased the hatchery workers workload and led to inefficiency. The presented work proposed an intelligent, web-based fish counting system to assist hatchery workers in counting fish from images. The methodology consists of two phases. First, an intelligent fish counting engine is developed. The captured image was first enhanced using the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. A deep learning architecture in the form of you only look once (YOLO)v5 is used to generate a model to identify and count fish on the image. Second, a web-based application is developed to implement the developed fish counting engine. When applied to the test data, the developed engine recorded a precision of 98.7% and a recall of 65.5%. The system is also evaluated by hatchery workers in the University Malaysia Sabah fish hatchery. The results of the usability and functionality evaluations indicate that the system is acceptable, with some future work suggested based on the feedback received. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - This paper presents an innovative flexible assembly system – hybrid assembly cell lines (HACL) to adapt to small batch, high product variety and dynamic demands. HACL provides specially designed trolleys for assembly operations, materials and tools to form the workstations flexibly and quickly at low reconfiguration cost. To conduct accurate and effective control for this complex assembly system, this paper presents a modified Graduation-inspired Manufacturing System (GMS), a recently proposed new card-based control system. GMS for HACL designs three kinds of tickets and the ticketing mechanism to absorb the uncertainties of HACL. Job tickets are for workload control and synchronization of part deliveries; setup tickets are for cell line formation and synchronization of resources of tools and machines; operation tickets are for production execution and synchronization of workers and operations in cell lines. GMS for HACL develops Internet of Things-enabled (IoT-enabled) architecture for managing the smart tickets to achieve automatic and intelligent interoperability between GMS and the physical workstations of HACL. This work designs synchronization mechanism based on specific model and genetic algorithm to synchronize manufacturing resources under GMS for HACL. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Distributed machine learning (DML) has become the common practice in industry, because of the explosive volume of training data and the growing complexity of training model. Traditional DML follows data parallelism but causes significant communication cost, due to the huge amount of parameter transmission. The recently emerging model-parallel solutions can reduce the communication workload, but leads to load imbalance and serious straggler problems. More importantly, the existing solutions, either data-parallel or model-parallel, ignore the nature of flexible parallelism for most DML tasks, thus failing to fully exploit the GPU computation power. Targeting at these existing drawbacks, we propose Fela, which incorporates both flexible parallelism and elastic tuning mechanism to accelerate DML. In order to fully leverage GPU power and reduce communication cost, Fela adopts hybrid parallelism and uses flexible parallel degrees to train different parts of the model. Meanwhile, Fela designs token-based scheduling policy to elastically tune the workload among different workers, thus mitigating the straggler effect and achieve better load balance. Our comparative experiments show that Fela can significantly improve the training throughput and outperforms the three main baselines (i.e. dataparallel, model-parallel, and hybrid-parallel) by up to 3.23×, 12.22×, and 1.85× respectively. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In many service industries, the speed of service and support by experienced employees are two major drivers of service quality. When demand for a service is variable and the staffing requirements cannot be adjusted quickly, choosing capacity levels requires making a tradeoff between service speed and operating costs, both of which depend on worker utilization. However, recent business models have enabled service systems to access a large pool of employees with flexible working hours that are compensated through piece-rates. Although this business model can operate at low levels of utilization without increasing operating costs, a different tradeoff emerges: The service platform must control employee turnover, which may increase when employees are working at low levels of utilization. Hence, to make staffing decisions and manage worker utilization, it is necessary to understand both customer conversion and employee retention, measuring their sensitivity to service time and utilization, respectively. In our application, we study an outbound call center that operates with a pool of flexible agents working remotely to sell auto insurance. We develop an econometric approach to model customer behavior that captures two key features of outbound calls: time sensitivity and employee heterogeneity. We find a strong impact of contact time on customer behavior: Conversion rates drop by 31% when the time to make the first outbound call increases from 5 to 30 minutes. In addition, we use a survival model to measure how agent retention is affected by utilization (which determined by workload and total staffing capacity) and find that, for more experienced worker, a 10% increase in utilization translates into a 33% decrease in weekly agent attrition. These empirical models of customer and agent behavior are combined to illustrate how to balance customer conversion and employee retention, showing that both are relevant to plan staffing and allocate workload in the context of an on-demand service platform. © 2023 INFORMS.

AB  - The construction industry is noted for high levels of occupational stress, particularly among professional workers. Using data from 676 architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, and project and construction managers responding to an on-line survey in South Africa, an integrated conceptual model of occupational stress is proposed. Structural equation modeling is used to test the model iteratively. The results of the final model indicate that: psychological, physiological and sociological strain effects are the terminal consequences of occupational stress; organizational climate is largely determined by gender and job demand, control and support; age, gender, control and organizational climate are predictors of discrimination; psychological distress is predicted by age, job demand and control factors, and organizational climate; sociological stress is determined by age, job demands, discrimination and psychological distress; and age, and sociological and psychological stress effects manifest themselves as predictors of physiological stress effects. Construction employers should regularly review workload allocations, empower employees, foster a supportive work environment, conduct stress appraisals, and hold stress management workshops.

AB  - In recent years, the affordances of immersive technologies in the industrial context have enabled the onsite worker to have increased potential towards handling the complex procedural and cognitive tasks involved in the strategy of manufacturing an appropriate product. This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mapping-based AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

New codecs, such as AV1, are being developed to deal with new demands for high video resolutions with bandwidth constraints and quality requirements. However, these new codecs have high computational requirements and new strategies are needed to accelerate their processing. Cloud computing offers interesting features such as on-demand resource allocation, multitenancy, elasticity, and resiliency among others. Deploying video coding and transcoding services on these infrastructures is suitable because it allows the adaptation of the resources to the workload, offers high availability, and provides ubiquitous access. This work proposes a cloud-based distributed architecture, tuned for video coding, that relies on an elastic pool of workers and media servers to provide fault-tolerance. A distributed application is deployed on the top of the architecture to split the video encoding process of a video in several jobs that can be dynamically assigned among the elastic pool of workers. The proposed solution is analyzed in terms of scalability, resource usage, and job distribution varying the number of workers for three well-known video codecs: H.265, VP9, and AV1. Moreover, the quality of the encoded videos has been evaluated for different bit rates and number of frames per job using full reference metrics like: PSNR, MS-SSIM, and VIF. Results show that our solution achieve similar quality and bitrate compared with full video coding while improving the total encoding time, which can decrease more than 90% depending on the encoder and the number of workers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) aim to increase safety and reduce mental workload. However, the gap in the understanding of the closed-loop driver-vehicle interaction often leads to reduced user acceptance. In this article, an optimal torque control law is calculated online in the model predictive control (MPC) framework to guarantee continuous guidance during the steering task. The research contribution is in the integration of an extensive prediction model covering cognitive behavior, neuromuscular dynamics, and the vehicle-steering dynamics, within the MPC-based haptic controller to enhance collaboration. The driver model is composed of a preview cognitive strategy based on a linear-quadratic-gaussian, sensory organs, and neuromuscular dynamics, including muscle coactivation and reflex action. Moreover, an adaptive cost-function algorithm enables dynamic allocation of the control authority. Experiments were performed in a fixed-base driving simulator at Toyota Motor Europe involving 19 participants to evaluate the proposed controller with two different cost functions against a commercial lane keeping assist system as an industry benchmark. The results demonstrate the proposed controller fosters symbiotic driving and reduces driver-vehicle conflicts with respect to a state-of-the-art commercial system, both subjectively and objectively, while still improving the path-tracking performance. Summarising, this article tackles the need to blend human and ADAS control, demonstrating the validity of the proposed strategy.  © 1996-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Human factors, including worker flexibility and learning–forgetting effects, are crucial factors in modern manufacturing systems to reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, traditional flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) only considers machine flexibility and ignores human factors. Therefore, this paper originally investigates a multi-objective FJSP considering human factors (MO-FJSPHF) to simultaneously minimize makespan, maximum machine workload, and total machine workload. Firstly, a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is established based on the characteristics of the MO-FJSPHF. Then, a multi-objective memetic algorithm based on learning and decomposition (MOMA-LD) is proposed to solve the model by incorporating the learning-based adaptive local search into the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In MOMA-LD, the machine learning technique determines which solutions deserve to perform the local search. Meanwhile, the computational resources are allocated dynamically based on the degree of population convergency during the evolutionary process. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms four state-of-the-art algorithms on forty-three test instances and three real-world cases from a casting workshop. The validity of the proposed MINLP model is examined by the exact solver Gurobi. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several studies have analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) using nonlinear methods, such as approximate entropy, the largest Lyapunov exponent, and correlation dimension in patients with cardiovascular disorders. However, few studies have used nonlinear methods to analyze HRV in order to determine the level of physical fatigue experienced by construction workers. As a result, to identify and categorize physical fatigue in construction workers, the current study examined the linear and nonlinear approaches of HRV analysis. Fifteen healthy construction workers (mean age, 33.2±6.9 years) were selected for this study. A textile-based wearable sensor monitored each participant's HRV after they completed 60 min of bar bending and fixing tasks. At baseline, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min into the task, participants were given the Borg-20 to measure their subjective levels of physical fatigue. Nonlinear [e.g., R-R interval (RRI) variability, entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis] and linear (e.g., time- and frequency-domain) HRV parameters were extracted. Five machine learning classifiers were used to identify and discern different physical fatigue levels. The accuracy and validity of the classifier models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The classification models were developed by either combining or individualized HRV features derived from linear and nonlinear HRV analyses. In the individualized feature sets, time-domain features had the highest classification accuracy (92%) based on the random forest (RF) classifier. The combined feature (i.e., the time-domain and nonlinear features) sets showed the highest classification accuracy (93.5%) using the RF classifier. In conclusion, this study showed that both linear and nonlinear HRV analyses can be used to detect and classify physical fatigue in construction workers. This research offers important contributions to the industry by analyzing the variations in linear and nonlinear HRV parameters in response to construction tasks. This study demonstrates that HRV values changed significantly in response to physical work, indicating a change in the relative activity of cardiac autonomic functions as a result of fatigue. Using the ways in which HRV parameters vary in response to increased workloads provides a sensitive marker for contrasting construction workers with and without cardiovascular disease. It also allows the site manager to track how quickly workers fatigue, so that they can switch up their workload to reduce the likelihood that any one worker would get severely exhausted, or to suggest that workers who are already severely fatigued take a break to prevent further injury.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Distribution planning becomes increasingly complex when warehouses handle products with varying life cycles; long (basic) and short (fashion). The varying demand patterns and life-cycles associated with each product class require different planning decisions possibly with different objectives; cost-efficiency for basic products and time-responsiveness for fashion products. Although it may appear that such products may be handled separately from inventory and transportation perspectives, they certainly are inseparable at the warehouse as they often get handled simultaneously by the same warehouse resources (i.e., workers and technology). To address this challenge, we introduce a novel problem to the literature, the two-product class, multi-product quantities, multi-echelon, multi-period, distribution planning problem. The uniqueness of this problem is in jointly deriving optimal distribution plans for both product classes, combined with optimal warehouse design decisions (e.g., technology and workforce), in order to minimize the total cost. We model this problem as a mixed-integer bilinear optimization problem, which turns out to be computationally challenging when dealing with industry-size instances (e.g., 200 stores, 1000 products, and 28 time-periods). We, therefore, propose a heuristic based on the iterative local search framework and conduct a comprehensive experimental study. Results suggest that with an increase in the proportion of fashion products, there is a substantial increase in warehouse workload variation, and subsequently total cost. An increase in fashion window tends to mitigate the variation and so do situations where the warehouse is located in regions with higher worker costs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The purposes of this study are to explore the principles and rules of human-service robot division and interaction when introducing service robots into the catering service industry. Focus group interview and in-depth expert interview were conducted. The results indicated that the participants had high acceptance of importing service robot into catering service. They feel the service robots are somewhat novel and attractively. From the perspective of task orientation, the participants think that the service robots could be introduced to all of the catering service process in the future. However, they also hoped that the human and robots can cooperate and work together in the processes. They hope to have more interaction with robots. They are delight to see the service robot can bring customers different feelings and experience. They don't want to face a standard and ice-cold robot. The participants hope that the service robots have a wide variety of external appearance to meet the style of restaurants. They also anticipate the robot can act various body movements and facial expression. Immediate assistance to customers and service workers are expected. Incorrect message transmission can be tolerant by the customers, however, exact communication with service personnel is considered to be very important. The service workers have willing to work together with service robots and hope the highrisk and heavy work can be done by service robots to reduce accidents and improve the reliability and safety. The feeling of safety and more affect feeling is needed for the customers. Besides, the participants are more concerned about the value that service robots can generate. Cost down of human resources and reduced workload was expected especially. Application of service robots does not necessarily imply that manual and cognitive tasks will be replaced by machines. It is essential to serve and observe the emotional needs of customers and service workers. Highskilled workers may become more productive as they become coworkers of machines and both complement each other even at the same level of value creation. Therefore, thinking about how to cooperate and work together for the workers and service robot while introducing service robot into catering service is an important topic. The customers and service workers are looking forward to get along with an interactive, emotional, and reliable service robot. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Background: Job stress is a probable mediator of the relationship between safety climate and accident occurrence. To demonstrate this, this study investigates the relationship between safety climate, job stress, and accident risk using a large number of surveys. The study will use structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the data collected from the surveys to examine the effect of safety climate on accident risk through job stress. Methods: The study is a cross-sectional study that was conducted on 1,530 male workers of a petrochemical company. The subjects were asked to complete several questionnaires during rest periods, which included demographic information, the Nordic safety climate questionnaire (NOSACQ-50), and the generic job stress questionnaire (GJSQ). Additionally, data on the frequency and intensity of accidents among participants were gathered from the health unit of the company. Path analysis was conducted by structural equation modeling (SEM) in Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) software. Results: The results revealed that the latent variable of safety climate with an effect coefficient of – 0.112 did not have a direct effect on accident risk (P = 0.343). However, safety climate with an effect coefficient of − 0.633 had an indirect effect on accident risk through job stress (P < 0.001). The total score of job stress had a significant direct effect (0.649) on accident risk (P < 0.001). Among the dimensions of safety climate, the variables of management’s safety priority, commitment, and competence (− 0.108) and workers’ safety commitment (− 0.107) had the highest indirect effect coefficients on accident risk. Among the dimensions of job stress, the highest indirect effects belonged to the variables of conflict at work (0.636), physical environment (0.631), and workload and responsibility (0.631), respectively. Conclusion: The results of the study revealed that job stress mediates the relationship between safety climate and accident risk. This finding suggests that organizations can potentially decrease accidents in industries by addressing and managing job stress in the workplace. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Elevated Work Platforms (EWP) have been implemented as a measure to prevent falls. However, fatalities and injuries relating to EWP use are of concern within the construction industry, with crushing risks often a significant factor in operator fatalities. With a greater number of workers using these machines internationally, it is imperative to develop policies and strategies to guarantee the safe use of EWPs. One key issue is that EWP familiarisation has been primarily centred on the user manual. However, it is unclear if user manuals are an adequate source of education and training in terms of content and readability. To address this research gap, a content analysis was used to assess the differences in content and readability among the manuals of the most used EWPs in Australia. The qualitative findings showed that there are nine safety-related themes in the user manuals, such as control warnings and in-basket safety. The quantitative analysis found that some manuals require several years of education above that recommended for a universal audience (>8 years) to be understood. This finding calls for better training and education across the range of EWP control layouts and standardisation across the methods by which the manuals convey control information to reduce the cognitive load placed on operators to remember and accurately utilise the controls of the wide variety of existing EWPs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and other Disruptive technology, have been directly responsible for the significant changes, renovations, and enhancements that have taken place in healthcare systems around the world. In spite of the many challenges, particularly in nations still growing their economies, the healthcare industry has a significant number of opportunities. Objective: To explore the key obstacles that were encountered by the healthcare industry both during and after the introduction of AI and other Disruptive technological practices associated with Health 4.0 in the healthcare industry to uncover how these variables influence AI and other Disruptive technology adoption in healthcare sector of India. Methods: An online survey format that included standardized questionnaire data was obtained from 83 hospitals, and a total of 434 samples have been implemented for various healthcare administrative staff members by the adoption of AI and Disruptive technology. ANOVA analysis was done to confirm the hypotheses' assumptions, then descriptive statistics were done to analyze the mean value, and also EFA and CFA analysis with SEM analysis has been done in the SPSS program for numerous validity tests (version 20). Results: This research explored 15 issues that healthcare administration staff members consider barriers and through the use of EFA, only two of the three primary obstacles "Additional workload" and "Problems with adopting technology" have a substantial impact on the rate at which AI is adopted in the healthcare industry, as seen through the eyes of the workers in that area. Conclusion: These challenges include a high need for capital, extra investments in new technologies like the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), business analytics,, resistance to change from both employees and employers, the need for a skilled workforce, and the upkeep of support systems. The use of blockchain technology in India's healthcare system as a secure service for administrative workers in Health 4.0 Practices could solve data security problems. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Manual assembly tasks are widespread in many production facilities. However, the manual tasks are often linked to workstations that are not ergonomically designed, which can lead to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs). These may result in low productivity, deterioration of worker performance, and issues affecting quality. The first aim of this research project is to analyze the various work postures associated with manual assembly work, within a plastics manufacturing company. The analysis of these work postures will help in understanding the ergonomic conditions of different workstations within the company. The second aim of this project is to study the OSHA incident reports and determine whether correlation exists between a specific workstation and specific body parts. The ultimate objective of this research is to find solutions and to recommend changes that improve the workstations. One way this can be accomplished is by taking ergonomic measures that can be used to evaluate working postures and physical workloads for manual assembly tasks to prevent ergonomic injuries which may lead to WRMDs. This is expected to result in improved productivity, better product quality, and lower medical costs. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - In various real life applications job processing times are controllable through the allocation of a limited resource. To date research has been conducted under the assumption that the relationship between the amount of resource allocated to a job and its processing time is independent of the number of tasks processed previously. However, there exist many manufacturing and service systems where workers and machines acquire, develop and refine skills through the repetition of identical or similar operations. In this paper we consider a scheduling model where job processing times are a convex function of the amount of resource they are allocated. In addition, we assume that the parameters of this function are position-dependent, i.e., vary with the job's position in the sequence. This assumption reflects general processes of learning or aging, or a combination of both. We first focus on a single machine setting and the makespan and total flowtime criteria. We show that the combined problem of finding an optimal job sequence and an optimal resource allocation can be solved in O(n3) time. We show that our algorithm can be used to address a bicriteria objective comprising of a linear combination of makespan and the total flowtime criteria on a single machine. We then extend the results to a parallel machine setting for the total flowtime criteria. Crown Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents the H-PULSE, a novel semi-passive upper-limb exoskeleton for worker assistance, with motorized tuning of the assistive level. The H-PULSE presents novel design features compared to other passive industrial exoskeletons for the upper limbs, namely joint angle sensors for measuring shoulder flexion/extension and a novel active mechanism for regulating the assistance level. These features could enhance the effectiveness of the system. Along with the presentation of the exoskeleton design, this article reports on the system experimental evaluation with human subjects. The H-PULSE was assessed in prolonged static overhead tasks under different conditions of assistive support. The set of metrics to evaluate the effects of the device included shoulder muscular activity, heart rate, and subjective user feedback. Results show that the exoskeleton can reduce the users' muscular activity and the heart rate. Subjective questionnaires allowed the assessment of perceived exoskeleton effectiveness. In this study, the H-PULSE exoskeleton was found to be potentially effective in reducing the muscular strain while reducing the global fatigue level during prolonged continuous overhead activities.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Among the leading immersive technologies, augmented reality is one of the most promising and empowering for supporting designers in production environments. This research investigates the application of mobile augmented reality, based on the Web, as a mediation tool focused on cognitive activities of reading and understanding of technical drawings in the production and assembly of tailor-made projects of the scenographic industry. In this context, the research presents a method to use WebAR to improve the reading of technical drawings, seeking efficiency in the visualization of models and the exchange of information between professionals involved in the processes of design, production, and assembly of products, in the scope of scenography. This mediation tool was developed using Web AR platforms, compatible with native libraries (ARCore and ARKit) to ensure, first, compatibility with commonly used devices that workers or businesses can access, and second, to leverage hybrid tracking techniques that combine vision and sensors to improve the reliability of augmented reality viewing. The proposed solution adopts multiple tracking and navigation techniques in order to expand Space Skills components to provide greater exploratory freedom to users. The research process took place in light of the Design Science Research Methodology and the DSR-Model, since it aimed to develop a solution to a practical problem, as well as to produce knowledge from this process. Field experiments were conducted in two real companies, with end users on their respective mobile devices, in order to evaluate usability and behavioral intent, through the Acceptance, Intent, and Use of Technology questionnaires and perceived mental workload, NASA-TLX. The experimental results show that the adoption of this tool reduces the cognitive load in the process of reading technical drawings and project understanding. In general, its usability and intent to use provided significant levels of satisfaction, being positively accepted by all participants involved in the study. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: As the tremendous impact of extreme workloads, arduous working conditions, and disorganization disrupt humane job definitions in some industries, the need for workplace re-articulation was interfered to ameliorate psycho-social factors and suggest organizational intervention strategies. Especially for colossally wounded health-care (HC) systems, today it is now even more unrealizable to retain workforce resilience considering the immense impact of overwhelming working conditions. Methods: This study introduces employment of concurrent engineering tools to re-design humane workplaces annihilating abatement over devoured resources. The study handles HC-workforce resilience in a pioneering motive to introduce transformation of well-known motivators and proposes solutions for retention and resilience issues grounding on HC workers’ own voice. Results: The proposed adjustable approach introduces integral use of focus group studies, SWARA, and QFD methods, and was practiced on a real-world case regarding Turkish HC workforce. The paper also presents widespread effects of findings by tendering generalized psycho-social rehabilitation strategies. Results confirmed the modifications of the most potent incessant motivators. Conclusion: “Burn out issues” and “Challenging work” were found as the most important motivator and satisfier, respectively, to be exigently fulfilled. Corrective interventions, required resolutions, and workplace articulation connotations were arbitrated in terms of entire outcomes on four dimensions in three different planning periods considering the current status, repercussions of pandemic, and contingency of similar catastrophes. Descriptive illustrations were additionally presented to support deducted interpretations. © 2024 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute

AB  - A robust teleoperation system has the potential to play a key role in mission tasks relevant to construction in a physically challenging environment. Here, the communication delay generated by long-distance and data transmission in teleoperation systems impacts human-robot interactions and work performances during the teleoperation. There is a need for more understanding of how time delay affects performance in construction activities and human operators' abilities, such as situational awareness and mental workload. This exploratory study aims to provide knowledge on the latency impacts on work performance and task load by measuring and evaluating the relevant human factors. Participants conduct construction tasks under time-delayed conditions in virtual reality environments. We assess the performance (i.e., completion time, success rate) and task load (i.e., mental demand, frustration) and observe manipulation behavior changes to evaluate the relationship between time delay and human factors during construction work. This paper contributes to exploring the signal latency by long-distance teleoperation and assesses its impacts on work performance, task load, and behavior changes while performing construction tasks. © 2024 ASCE.

AB  - Early detection of pneumoconiosis by routine health screening of workers in the mining industry is critical for preventing the progression of this incurable disease. Automated pneumoconiosis classification in chest X-ray images is challenging due to the low contrast of opacities, inter-class similarity, intra-class variation and the existence of artifacts. Compared to traditional methods, convolutional neural networks have shown significant improvement in pneumoconiosis classification tasks, however, accurate classification remains challenging due to mainly the inability to focus on semantically meaningful lesion opacities. Most existing networks focus on high level abstract information and ignore low level detailed object information. Different from natural images where an object occupies large space, the classification of pneumoconiosis depends on the density of small opacities inside the lung. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage adaptive multi-scale feature pyramid network called AMFP-Net for the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis from chest X-rays. The proposed model consists of 1) an adaptive multi-scale context block to extract rich contextual and discriminative information and 2) a weighted feature fusion module to effectively combine low level detailed and high level global semantic information. This two-stage network first segments the lungs to focus more on relevant regions by excluding irrelevant parts of the image, and then utilises the segmented lungs to classify pneumoconiosis into different categories. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform state-of-the-art methods for both segmentation and classification. © 2024 The Author(s)

The AOL has developed powerful air traffic simulation capabilities, most notably the Multi Aircraft Control System (MACS) that is used for many air traffic control simulations at NASA and its partners in government, academia and industry. Several additional NASA technologies have been integrated with the AOL's primary simulation capabilities where appropriate. Using this environment, large and small-scale system-level evaluations can be conducted to help make near-term improvements and transition NASA technologies to the FAA, such as the technologies developed under NASA's Air Traffic Management Demonstration-1 (ATD-1). The AOL's rapid prototyping and flexible simulation capabilities have proven a highly effective environment to progress the initiation of trajectory-based operations and support the mid-term implementation of NextGen. Fundamental questions about accuracy requirements have been investigated as well as real-world problems on how to improve operations in some of the most complex airspaces in the US. This includes using advanced trajectory-based operations and prototype tools for coordinating arrivals to converging runways at Newark airport and coordinating departures and arrivals in the San Francisco and the New York metro areas. Looking beyond NextGen, the AOL has started exploring hybrid human/automation control strategies as well as highly autonomous operations in the air traffic control domain. Initial results indicate improved capacity, low operator workload, good situation awareness and acceptability for controllers teaming with autonomous air traffic systems. While much research and development needs to be conducted to make such concepts a reality, these approaches have the potential to truly transform the airspace system towards increased mobility, safe and efficient growth in global operations and enabling many of the new vehicles and operations that are expected over the next decades. This paper describes how the AOL currently contributes to the ongoing air transportation transformation.

AB  - Industrialization is a response to low productivity and shortage of skilled labour. Advancement in technology is associated with the growing trend. Thus, industrialisation requires upskilling the whole workforce – literacy, numeracy, technical and trade skills. This crisis is exacerbated by the casualization of construction labor over the last ~60 years which means construction companies do not see it as in their interest to upskill those they do not employ. Even though “with every pair of hands comes a free brain” (Henry Ford), the construction sector seems to find it acceptable to do little or nothing to use and develop those brains, to tap into this unused talent. Motivated by these insights, we ask, what can we learn from corporate success outside construction that might help improve industrialised project delivery in construction? This qualitative exploratory analysis of successful major transformations in other sectors uses selective literature review, categorical aggregation of case studies and inductive reasoning. The findings underscore the importance of leaders with ‘constancy of purpose’ driving system change in order to build the capacity and competence of workers. In construction this may mean decasualising labour which will require the creation of pipelines of work to ensure a steady workload. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research and validation in the field. © 2022 30th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2022. All rights reserved.

AB  - The convergence of Telecommunication and industry operational networks towards cloud native applications has enabled the idea to integrate protection layers to harden security posture and management of cloud native based deployments. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to support detection of anomalies in cloud native application based on a graph neural network. The essence of the profiling relies on capturing interactions between different perspectives in cloud native applications through a network dependency graph and transforming it to a computational graph neural network. The latter is used to profile different deployed assets like micro-service types, workloads' namespaces, worker machines, management and orchestration machines as well as clusters. As a first phase of the profiling, we consider a fine-grained profiling on microservice types with an emphasis on network traffic indicators. These indicators are collected on distributed Kubernetes (K8S) deployment premises. Experimental results shows good trade-off in terms of accuracy and recall with respect to micro-service types profiling (around 96%). In addition, we used predictions entropy scores to infer anomalies in testing data. These scores allow to segregate between benign and anomalous graphs, where we identified 19 out of 23 anomalies. Moreover, by using entropy scores, we can conduct a root cause analysis to infer problematic micro-services.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This work in progress paper draws on data from year one of a multi-year project aimed at integrating engineering into middle-school science classes. The expectation that middle school teachers integrate engineering into their science curriculum may be challenging as engineering-related content has not historically been part of teacher preparation. Particularly in rural areas, in-service teacher training related to engineering may be absent or difficult to access due to proximity or financial or time costs. Therefore, it is important to develop effective professional development (PD) that works within the actual teaching context and makes few demands on teachers beyond their regular workload. In partnership with teachers and local industry workers in rural and Appalachian areas, the Virginia Tech Partnering with Educators and Engineers in Rural Schools (VT-PEERS) project developed extended classroom engineering activities for students that also served as teacher PD related to teaching engineering in locally relevant ways. As part of this work, a qualitative analysis was conducted to understand how teachers, from their perspectives, envisioned their role during the interventions. Data were collected prior to and after interventions (within an academic year) to further understand if, and if so, how, teacher perspectives of their role changed. Results reveal three initial roles; classroom manager, learner, helper, and unsure. The post intervention data revealed all teachers indicated being a “learner”. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - Wearable augmented reality (AR) smart glasses have been utilized in various applications such as training, maintenance, and collaboration. However, most previous research on wearable AR technology did not effectively supported situation-aware task assistance because of AR marker-based static visualization and registration. In this study, a smart and user-centric task assistance method is proposed, which combines deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation with wearable AR technology to provide more effective visual guidance with less cognitive load. In particular, instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN and markerless AR are combined to overlay the 3D spatial mapping of an actual object onto its surrounding real environment. In addition, 3D spatial information with instance segmentation is used to provide 3D task guidance and navigation, which helps the user to more easily identify and understand physical objects while moving around in the physical environment. Furthermore, 2.5D or 3D replicas support the 3D annotation and collaboration between different workers without predefined 3D models. Therefore, the user can perform more realistic manufacturing tasks in dynamic environments. To verify the usability and usefulness of the proposed method, we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses by conducting two user studies: 1) matching a virtual object to a real object in a real environment, and 2) performing a realistic task, that is, the maintenance and inspection of a 3D printer. We also implemented several viable applications supporting task assistance using the proposed deep learning-based task assistance in wearable AR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the upswing in the volume of data, information online, and magnanimous cloud applications, big data analytics becomes mainstream in the research communities in the industry as well as in the scholarly world. This prompted the emergence and development of real-time distributed stream processing frameworks, such as Flink, Storm, Spark, and Samza. These frameworks endorse complex queries on streaming data to be distributed across multiple worker nodes in a cluster. Few of these stream processing frameworks provides fundamental support for controlling the latency and throughput of the system as well as the correctness of the results. However, none has the ability to handle them on the fly at runtime. We present a well-informed and efficient adaptive watermarking and dynamic buffering timeout mechanism for the distributed streaming frameworks. It is designed to increase the overall throughput of the system by making the watermarks adaptive towards the stream of incoming workload, and scale the buffering timeout dynamically for each task tracker on the fly while maintaining the Service Level Agreement (SLA)-based end-to-end latency of the system. This work focuses on tuning the parameters of the system (such as window correctness, buffering timeout, and so on) based on the prediction of incoming workloads and assesses whether a given workload will breach an SLA using output metrics including latency, throughput, and correctness of both intermediate and final results. We used Apache Flink as our testbed distributed processing engine for this work. However, the proposed mechanism can be applied to other streaming frameworks as well. Our results on the testbed model indicate that the proposed system outperforms the status quo of stream processing. With the inclusion of learning models like naïve Bayes, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and sequential minimal optimization (SMO)., the system shows more progress in terms of keeping the SLA intact as well as quality of service (QoS). © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Aim: This study investigated and compared the associations between self-reported exposures to individual as well as work-related physical and psychosocial risk factors for musculoskeletal (MS) disorders and the prevalence of MS symptoms in different body areas among short- (P&D) and long-distance (Bulk delivery) truck drivers working for the same large gas delivery company in Canada. Methods: 123 truck drivers nationwide participated in this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: 43.1% of drivers reported MS pain in at least one body area over the past 12 months and 26.8% over the past 7 days. Bulk drivers had a significantly higher prevalence of MS pain than P&D drivers for both periods. When P&D and Bulk drivers were pooled together, belonging to the Bulk subgroup emerged as the strongest factor for low back pain (OR = 8.45, p = 0.002), for shoulder pain (OR = 3.70, p = 0.027) and for MS pain in any body area (OR = 4.05, p = 0.006). In Bulk drivers “High effort-reward imbalance” was strongly associated with MS pain in any body area (OR = 6.47, p = 0.01), with shoulder pain (OR = 4.95, p = 0.016), and with low back pain (OR = 4.51, p = 0.02). In P&D drivers MS pain in any body area was strongly associated with “Working with hands above shoulders” (OR = 6.58, p = 0.009) and “Whole-body vibration” (OR = 5.48, p = 0.018), while shoulder pain was strongly associated with “Hand-arm vibration” (OR = 7.27, p = 0.041). Conclusions: Prevalence of MS pain was higher among industrial gas delivery truck drivers than in the general Quebec male worker population, and higher for Bulk drivers compared to P&D drivers. MS pain in Bulk drivers was mainly associated with psychosocial risk factors and lifestyle; MS pain in P&D drivers was mainly associated with physical risk factors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for humanitarian applications require simple, accessible and reliable components. For example, a communication system between UAV and the Ground Control Station (GCS) is essential in order to monitor UAV status; various communication protocols are available in the industry. Such systems must be simple for non-technical personnel (e.g., healthcare workers) to operate. In this study, a novel link failure detection and switching algorithm was proposed for a dissimilar redundant UAV communication system designed for longrange vaccine delivery in rural areas. The algorithm would ease the workload of the operators and address a research gap in the design of such algorithms. A two-layer design is proposed: A baseline layer using the heartbeat method, and optimisations to speed up local failure detection. To dynamically tune the heartbeat timeout for the algorithm’s baseline without intervention from ground operators, the modified Jacobson’s algorithm was used. Lab simulations found that the algorithm was generally accurate in converging to an optimal value, but has less satisfactory performance at poor or unpredictable connectivity, or when link switches get triggered frequently. Improvements have been suggested for the algorithm. This study contributes to ongoing research on ensuring reliable UAV communication for humanitarian purposes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Prolonged work stress, as indicated by the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model, jeopardizes health. Cortisol represents a candidate mechanism connecting stress to ill health. However, previous findings appear inconclusive, and recommendations were made to assess work stress at multiple time points and also to investigate ERI (sub-)components. This study therefore examines the effects of two single time points, as well as the mean and change scores between time points of ERI and its components on hair cortisol concentration (HCC), a long-term cortisol measurement. Participants were 66 male factory workers (age: 40.68 ± 6.74 years; HCC: 9.00 ± 7.11 pg/mg), who were followed up after a stress management intervention (2006–2008). In 2008 (T1) and 2015 (T2), participants completed a 23-item ERI questionnaire, assessing effort, the three reward components (esteem, job security, job promotion) and over-commitment. In 2015, participants also provided a 3-cm hair segment close to the scalp for HCC analysis, as well as information on relevant confounders (i.e. medication intake, age, work characteristics, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, number of stressful life events). Linear regressions revealed hardly any cross-sectional or longitudinal effect of ERI and its components on HCC. Only the change scores between T1 and T2 of job security were negatively associated with lower HCC in unadjusted (β = −.320; p =.009) and adjusted (β = −.288; p =.044) models. In this study, only a decrease of perceived job security over time was significantly associated with higher HCC, and other predictors were not related to this outcome. Especially after correction for multiple testing, this study revealed just a weak association of different psychosocial work measurements with HCC. Lay summary This study showed that an increase in perceived job insecurity is correlated with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The higher levels of cortisol might represent a biological explanation for the negative health effects of job insecurity. The association was, however, relatively low, and more and more voices are questioning whether cortisol in hair is a reliable marker for perceived work stress. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Poor engineering information provided to construction crews results in inefficient communication of design, leading to construction rework, disputes, and lower worker morale. The resulting errors, omissions, and misinterpretations indicates that a significant opportunity exists to improve the traditional documentation of engineering information that craft professionals use to complete their work. Historically, physical three dimensional (3D) models built by hand provided 3D physical representations of the project to assist in sequencing, visualization, and planning of critical construction activities. This practice has greatly diminished since the adoption of three dimensional CAD (computer-aided design) and BIM (building information modeling) technologies. Recently, additive manufacturing technologies have allowed for three dimensional printing of 3D CAD models. Methods: The effectiveness of 2D drawings, a 3D computer model, and a 3D printed model in delivering engineering information to an end-user are scientifically measured. Results: The 3D printed model outperformed the 2D drawings and 3D computer interface in productivity and workload measures. Conclusions: A physical model has the ability to improve communication of spatial design for certain tasks. This could lead to improved productivity, reduction of errors, and better quality for construction tasks. This paper's primary contribution to the body of knowledge is that it identifies how different mediums of engineering information impact the communication of spatial engineering information. © 2014, Dadi et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - With the upsurge in the volume of data and profuse cloud applications, big data analytics becomes very popular in the research communities in industry as well as in academia. This led to the emergence of real-Time distributed stream processing systems such as Flink, Storm, Spark, and Samza. These systems sanction complex queries on streaming data to be distributed across multiple worker nodes in a cluster. Some of the stream processing systems provide basic supports for controlling the latency and throughput of the system as well as correctness of the results. We present an intelligent and efficient adaptive watermarking and dynamic buffering timeout mechanism for modern distributed stream processing engines. It is designed to increase the overall throughput by making the watermarks of the system adaptive according to incoming workload streams, and dynamically scale the buffering timeout for every task tracker on the fly while maintaining the SLA-based end-To-end latency of the system. Apache Flink is used as testing distributed processing engine in the paper. However, the proposed mechanism can be applied to other streaming frameworks. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed system outperforms the existing stream processing framework. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Automation is revolutionising many industries, including healthcare. Autonomous vehicles are now more or less a reality. In the current clinical scenario, the role of automated vehicles has increased the efficiency and reliable transport of commodities to desired places. Automated systems are preferred as risk of transmission of highly infectious diseases are reduced. It also reduces wastage of human resources, thus saving time. The main aim of the work, LiDAR BASED AUTONOMOUSLY NAVIGATING ROBOT is to build an automated trolley to deliver medicines and necessary items to patients inwards without direct contact between patients and health care workers. It has innumerous benefits in geriatric healthcare. It can reduce the risk of falls and injuries by minimising the need for elderly patients to move around the hospital or care facility. The timely delivery of medicines and meals can be ensured, minimising missed doses or delayed meals. The robot can also help relieve the workload of nursing staff, allowing them to focus on direct patient care. Additionally, the robot's autonomous navigation can be programmed to avoid obstacles and adapt to changing environments, making it a safe and reliable option for elderly patients. The use of LiDAR technology can also enable the robot to accurately detect and navigate around obstacles, making it a valuable tool for ensuring patient safety. The trolley utilises a LiDAR for mapping as well as obstacle detection and raspberry pi for processing information obtained from LiDAR, Arduino Mega for controlling the movement of wheels and a motor driver for controlling the speed of trolley. The automated trolley proposed in this work will bring an elevating change in the healthcare sector. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The automotive industry is growing constantly and more and more assembly workers are needed to negotiate the production volume. The training of new employees is essential to ensure premium quality products and processes. New technologies for training such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) receive a growing amount of attention by the scientific community, especially in the industrial domain. Due to its possibility to work hands-free while providing users with necessary augmented information, HMDs can enhance the quality and efficiency of assembly training tasks. However, comprehensive evaluations in industrial environments regarding the training transfer using augmented reality (AR) technologies are still very limited. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by conducting a user study with two groups and 30 participants, measuring the training transfer. We compare the effects of two slightly different HMD-based training applications. The first group complete a tutorial, beginner, intermediate and expert training level, while the second group received an additional quiz level. Results show that group two needed 17% more time to complete the training but made 79% less sequence mistakes compared to the first group. Additionally, we compare the user satisfaction by using the system usability scale (SUS) and the perceived workload by measuring the NASA-TLX. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - In the profoundly aggressive programming industry software project scheduling issue is one of the testing issues confronted by the software project directors. Distinctive programming project undertakings oblige representatives with diverse abilities, and aptitude capability of workers assumes the real part in the effectiveness of task execution. Thus, human asset distribution has turned into an essential part in software task scheduling. The essential target of our work is to create a pragmatic and successful methodology for the task scheduling and human resource allocation issue in software project planning with Hybrid ABC-GA algorithm. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm has been broadly actualized in a different types of optimization problem, for example, job shop scheduling, constraint optimization issues, complex numerical optimization issues, and mathematical function issues. Be that as it may, the convergence speed of ABC is relatively less. Subsequently with the assistance of Genetic algorithm (GA) strategy, a mechanized methodology has been proposed in this work and is named as the Hybrid ABC-GA optimization algorithm. The features utilized here are representation plan. It is made out of a task list and a planned employee allocation matrix. The task list characterizes the priorities of tasks to allocation resources. The allocation matrix points out the initially planned workload assignments. Henceforth the representation scheme considers both the issues of task scheduling and resource allocation into account. The performance of the representation plan with the hybrid ABC-GA will be examined with existing methodologies and the productivity of our proposed work will be demonstrated as far as expense and intricacy. The proposed technique will be executed in JAVA. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Women are not only carriers of human race but civilization and sustainable development rest on them. Their role is quietly appreciated without economic recognition, regard and accountability. The household activities farm women of Meghalaya do are labour intensive, time consuming, arduous, monotonous, repetitive, manual and within economic return resulting in fatigue and drudgery. This study was conducted to determine the perceived physiological exertion, physiological responses and musculoskeletal problem while doing the activity of firewood collection. The subject included forty tribal women of West Garo Hill of Meghalaya within the age group of 20 to 50 years having the average BMI of 21.74, Lean body mass 31.99 kg., fat weight 12.59 kg., VO2 max. 25.59 ml/kg/min and grip strength of 28.59 kg. While doing the activity average heart rate, energy expenditure, total cardiac cost of work and physiological cost of work were 129.67 bpm, 11.90 kj/min, 8529.59 beats and 47.92 ppm, respectively. The cardiovascular stress index was quite high (47.25) in comparison to many workers involved in factory activities. Perceived physical exertion was rated by farm women as “heavy to very heavy”. Incidences of musculoskeletal problem were also very high as farm women reported that they had severe to very severe pain in upper and lower back, neck, head, arm, wrist and fingers. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - The present study examined the presence of a gap between leaders’ and members’ safety climate perceptions in South Korean chemical companies. Also, it examined how this gap relates to workplace safety and organizational attitudes at the work-unit level by endorsing the notion that the psychological contract theory is an appropriate approach to understanding incongruence in safety climate perceptions. Paired t-test and response surface analysis were conducted using the sample of 4,978 organizational members nested within 122 work-units. Leaders reported significantly higher safety climate perceptions than members. When safety climate perceptions between leaders and members were significantly different, safety compliance behavior was low and injury rates, cynicism, and turnover intentions were greater. Incongruence in safety climate might compromise organizational safety and foster negative organizational attitude. Also, when safety climate perceptions of leaders and members were both high, then safety compliance behavior was high and cynicism was lower suggesting that convergent thinking regarding safety climate amongst leaders and members can be beneficial. The present study demonstrated the importance of monitoring and addressing the gap between leaders’ and members’ safety climate perceptions in hazardous industries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - During the last years, as a result of the technological development, farmers started to include a new solution like machinery or other devices but the risk level connected with accidents resulting from their use is still high. Agriculture is described as one of the most dangerous industry in Poland. Based on these circumstances the studies were conducted where the main objective was to investigate a workload during agricultural manual and mechanized tasks. The analysis was conducted on 15 farmers on their own farms during the morning and evening milking in the tethering and carousel systems while lifting and carrying a full bucket or a sack and while the tractor was moving. The analysis of muscle load was conducted with the surface EMG (Electromyography) system and Job Strain Index method. The highest values of muscle tension and force were observed in the forearm muscles during the attachment of teat cups to the udder. It was connected with lifting the equipment in an uncomfortable posture assumed by the milker. For the tractor driver the ergonomics of the seat and steering wheel was measured. It has been demonstrated that unfavourable working conditions increase the musculoskeletal overload. One of the methods of preventing them is to create appropriate working conditions for a specific person and gender. This will allow each worker to properly adjust the work and to apply specific matching equipment. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - Construction work is one of the leading sources of occupational injuries and fatalities in Uganda. This paper set out to investigate the causes of construction accidents in Kampala, Uganda using ordinary least squares regression and spatial regression modeling. A cross-sectional survey of 201 large-size building projects commissioned by Kampala City Council in 2008 was undertaken. Data collected from the survey was supplemented by building records from Kampala City Council, safety statistics from the Department of Occupational Safety and Health, and accident investigation reports. The injury rate for Kampala is deduced to be 3797 per 100,000 workers and the fatality rate is 84 per 100,000 workers. The three most prevalent causes of accidents in Kampala are mechanical hazards (i.e. struck by machines, vehicles, hand tools, cutting edges, etc.), being hit by falling objects and falls from height. Congestion, a phenomenon which arises when there is evidence of high building density amidst many fulltime workers on site, is discussed. Through spatial statistical analysis, construction accidents that occur at one location were found to be related to those that occur in the neighborhood. To mitigate accidents occurrence, policies on regulating working hours, provision of safety equipment, equipment maintenance and on standards of acceptable building densities are suggested. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Risky behaviours have received little attention in the safety literature in recent years, compared to safety behaviours such as safety compliance or safety participation. However, it is important to focus on risky behaviours and their predictors in order to prevent accidents. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of role stressors (role ambiguity and role overload) on risky behaviours, and the mediating role of dissatisfaction (both job and safety dissatisfaction). The sample consists of 566 employees from two nuclear power plants in Spain. Structural equation modelling is used to determine the effects of role ambiguity and role overload on risky behaviours. Role stressors (role ambiguity and role overload) predict risky behaviours. On the one hand, role ambiguity predicts risky behaviours through dissatisfaction with both the job and safety. On the other hand, role overload positively and directly influences risky behaviours. Assessing and reducing workers’ role ambiguity and role overload levels is vital to avoid risky behaviours among employees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Successful interaction with complex processes, like those in the modern factory, is based on the system’s ability to satisfy the user needs during human tasks, mainly related to performances, physical comfort, usability, accessibility, visibility, and mental workload. However, the ‘real’ user perception is hidden and usually difficult to detect. User eXperience (UX) is a useful concept related to subjective perceptions and responses that result from the interaction with a product, system or process, including users’ emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviors and accomplishments that occur before, during and after use. The paper proposes the creation of a User eXperience Index (UXI) to assess the quality of human-system interaction during job tasks and, consequently, evaluate both process and workstation. The proposed approach has been applied to improve the design of assembly human tasks, using a virtual simulated case study focusing on tractor assembly. Tests with users, with different levels of expertise, allowed us to validate the proposed approach and to optimize the assembly task sequence. Results showed how the proposed UXI can validly objectify the workers’ experience and can be validly used to improve the design of human tasks. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In human-robot collaboration (HRC) for assembly, a robot needs to use its onboard vision systems to perform many sensing tasks. The robot's observations may not be always reliable due to erroneous sensing caused by limitations of the detection systems and disturbances. Hence, additional observations made by the robot or the human co-worker seem to be necessary. However, too much human involvement may increase human workload. Hence, allocation of autonomy through switching between autonomous and manual sensing (observation) modes seems to be reasonable. Bayesian sequential decision-making may be an approach to determine the optimal allocation of these modes in the presence of sensing uncertainties. However, optimal decision-making approaches such as the Bayesian approach may not necessarily fit with human's decision style. It has been shown that human regret plays a critical role in decision-making under uncertainty. It is rational for humans to make suboptimal choices to avoid regret. In this paper, we include human regret analysis in Bayesian decision-making in the automated allocation of sensing modes for detection of right assembly parts. We evaluate this approach in a human-robot collaborative assembly task. The experimental results show that regret-based human-like suboptimal allocation of autonomous and manual sensing modes improves human-robot interaction and assembly performance. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The behaviour-based approach has been widely used to develop interventions for construction accident prevention. The actual effects of such interventions, however, often do not meet expectation or have only a short-term effect. Recent studies look beyond the immediate accident circumstances to shed light on systemic factors that lead to accidents. The authors present an institutional analysis of construction accident causality through investigation of heat illness cases on construction sites. Heat illness is a special type of incident in which the individual is both the victim and, to a certain extent, the agent. Its consequence can be fatal, but its spread to uninvolved personnel is limited. Like other construction accidents, it affects individuals but cannot be effectively managed without addressing the risks embedded in the institutional environment of the system in which the individual is situated. This provides a simplified event for identifying institutional factors affecting construction accident causation at different systems levels in construction projects. The analysis is based on 216 individual construction workers' cases from 29 construction sites, including 36 reported critical incidents of heat illness cases. These are triangulated with data from site observation, interviews with managers and field notes of stakeholders' meetings. Institutional factors that contribute to proactive and reactive behavioural intervention of heat illness development are identified at eight levels of systems. The findings can be used in guiding accident investigation, developing effective interventions and identifying improvement opportunities for stakeholders at different levels of systems related to a construction project. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Age is one of the critical factors used by many organizations to determine employees' performance. It is being considered in the retirement process of construction professionals. However, age as a critical factor is not considered in the recruitment of a specific set of workers in the construction industry. Therefore, this study investigated the significant relationship between the ages of tradespeople and their performance in construction projects. The study also explored the age at which performance begins to decline and proposes strategies that can be used to sustain their effectiveness before the official retirement age. Design/methodology/approach: Mixed methods research designs were adopted in the study. To be precise, physical observations, interviews and questionnaires were the instruments used for data collection in the mixed methods research design. Findings: The outcomes of the study revealed that the age groups of tradespeople in the Nigerian construction industry are 16–30 (group one), 31–45 (group two) and 46–58 (group three) respectively. Group three is the prevalent age group. It was also discovered that performance begins to decline at 53 years. The age-performance decline of tradespeople in Nigerian construction projects can be delayed through certain strategies such as regular strength training exercises and an adequate nutritional lifestyle. Research limitations/implications: The study enables construction managers to have an adequate understanding of the negative influence of old age on the performance of tradespeople in construction projects. This will enable construction firm managers to recruit from the age range of 16–52 and stop retiring employees within this age bracket, consequently curbing the skills gap which is prevalent in the study context and the global construction industry. The study is limited to tradespeople performance in construction firms in Abuja, Nigeria where there are several ongoing projects on a daily basis. Practical implications: The study enables project managers to estimate the number of tradespeople required for a particular task and consequently save the aged tradespeople from health risks associated with excessive workloads. Originality/value: This paper is the first of its kind to be conducted in the study context, to establish the specific age at which performance begins to decline among construction tradespeople. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - With the rapid development of civil aviation industry, maintaining airport operation normally is a big workload every day. The navigation lamp system plays an important role on the operation of the airport. According to each airport's scales, there are considerable lamps install in airport running way and each lamps need to keep working well especially when airplane taking off or landing, however, inspecting each lamp's statues is a heavy works, the present solution is arranging special workers to check all navigation lamps, and airplane keep staying before examine finished. Due to the inspect time is very limited and the number of the navigation lamps is large, causing the intensity and difficulty increased. If staff found the faulty lamps in the process of inspection, only the second time to repair or replace. In order to improve airport operational efficiency. This paper will use the AI technology build an Expert system prototype to predict evaluation of lamps faulty based on lamp electrical characteristics, time of use, structure characteristics, thermal properties and others indicator, which is useful for staff to improve the work efficiency. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Collaborative robots, or cobots, offer a unique combination of productivity and flexibility that has led to significant growth in adoption over the past decade. Moreover, recently, there has been a shift towards a human-centered design of the workspace, known as one of the drivers of Industry 5.0, which prioritizes the well-being of operators. To achieve this, various human factors such as ergonomics, mental workload, personal skills, and capabilities need to be considered in the workspace design, and their impact on system productivity must be evaluated. The integration of a human and a cobot in the same workplace can affect the performance of the human operator, as the perception of the cobot can impact their work. This highlights the importance of taking human factors into account, as a lack of consideration in these aspects has contributed to the failure of many implementations. To link the objectives of productivity, flexibility, and human factors consideration, a dynamic real-time multi-objective task allocation strategy for collaborative assembly systems is developed. This approach considers the different characteristics of the resources and optimizes for two objectives, makespan, and energy expenditure of the operator. By using this approach, it is possible to modify the behavior of the cobot by reallocating tasks between the two resources based on the operator’s current needs. In other words, if the operator appears too stressed due to time constraints or their energy rate level is too high, some of their assigned tasks can be transferred to the cobot. This helps to maintain a balanced system while reducing the operator’s stress. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Theoretical modeling is a popular method for quantitative analysis and performance prediction of computer systems, including cloud systems. Low entropy cloud (i.e., low interference among workloads and low system jitter) is becoming a new trend, where the Labeled Network Stack (LNS) based server is a good case to gain orders of magnitude performance improvement compared to servers based on traditional network stacks. However, it is desirable to figure out 1) where the low tail latency and the low entropy of LNS mainly come from, compared with mTCP, a typical user-space network stack in academia, and Linux network stack, the mainstream network stack in industry, and 2) how much LNS can be further optimized. Therefore, we propose a queueing theory-based analytical method defining a bottleneck stage to simplify the quantitative analysis of tail latency. Facilitated by the analytical method, we establish models characterizing the change of processing speed in different stages for an LNS-based server, an mTCP-based server, and a Linux-based server, with bursty traffic as an example. Under such traffic, each network service stage's processing speed is obtained by non-intrusive basic tests to identify the slowest stage as the bottleneck according to traffic and system characteristics. Our models reveal that the full-datapath prioritized processing and the full-path zero-copy are primary sources of the low tail latency and the low entropy of the LNS-based server, with 0.8%-24.4% error for the 99th percentile latency. In addition, the model of the LNS-based server can give the best number of worker threads querying a database, improving 2.1 ×-3.5 × in concurrency. © 2022 Hongrui Guo et al.

AB  - Cannabis legalization in Washington State has increased the availability, consumption, and potency of cannabis products for adults. Public health education promoting safe use for adult consumers has lagged behind these trends. This study assesses the potential of cannabis retail workers (budtenders) to engage in responsible use education with adult consumers at point of sale. Focus groups explored how budtenders perceive their professional role, including educating consumers about cannabis over intoxication, storage, and risks of use before driving and during pregnancy. Transcripts were analyzed to develop a coding scheme, which was then applied with an iterative review by the research team. Budtenders identified three main professional roles: creating a good experience for customers; being compliant with the state law and regulations, and educating customers on products. Budtenders did not believe their job involved discussing use during pregnancy or while driving or safe storage. They prioritized customers’ autonomy over education on these topics, and they did not necessarily consider these behaviors to be harmful. Budtenders are committed to keeping minors outside stores and educating consumers on how to avoid over intoxication and exposure to cannabis contaminants. Future research could build on this to develop point-of-sale education to reduce cannabis use risks. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The current research aims to evaluate the quality of work health and safety (WHS) disclosures by the top 100 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX100) with the view to determining whether mandatory WHS reporting may assist in improving health and safety standards. The 2018 and 2019 annual reports of ASX100 companies were analysed for WHS reporting of injury, illness, near misses and fatalities. Content analysis revealed that very few companies reported WHS metrics; however, companies in more hazardous industries reported more than those in less hazardous industries. Of the metrics that were reported, lagging rather than the more valid and predictive leading metrics were presented. Very few companies disclosed content related to the number of current or ongoing internal or external investigations of serious injury or near misses. These findings demonstrate a lack of reporting overall, as well as inconsistencies in the quality of WHS reporting across companies. Given that the primary purpose of WHS reporting is to improve standards to safeguard workers, the current work suggests that voluntary reporting provides inadequate protection. Mandatory WHS reporting of specific indices by publicly listed companies in their annual reports is proposed as a potential solution to improve and standardise reporting quality and quantity. This form of regulation would also ensure parity of information disclosure among firms and reduce information asymmetries. The need for and merit of standardised reporting, as well as how best to achieve this via policy and practice, are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, digital twin technology has become increasingly popular and been widely applied across different industries including air traffic management (ATM). While previous studies on digital twin in ATM focused on factors such as system architecture, synthetic data generation and transfer, and real-time simulation, there is currently a lack of research on visualization and interaction design of digital twin from human factors’ perspective. Moreover, recent advances in virtual and mixed reality (VR/MR) technology give potential for designing interactive digital twin in 3D space that can assist human operators in performing their duties. Therefore, this research aims to explore visualization and interaction design of an MR-based digital twin prototype that can assist air traffic controllers (ATCOs) in carrying out ground control tasks. Specifically, MR headsets (Microsoft HoloLens 2) are leveraged to project out-of-tower view of airport traffic onto a 3D printed airport model at a 1:1 scale. The spatially aligned tangible system enables ATCOs to perform typical ATM operations by directly touching the 3D printed airport model. In addition, collaborative features are implemented into the system, which enable multiple ATCOs to have a shared view of the airport traffic and collaboratively perform ATM operations when wearing the MR headsets. Finally, a user study was conducted with the recruitment of ten licensed ATCOs to investigate usability of the system and ATCOs’ workload, situational awareness and trust when using the system. The feedback from the ATCOs in the user study suggested that: (1) The visual and interactive design were acceptable; (2) The ATCOs indicated varied workload under different scenarios; (3) The ATCOs developed a high level of shared situational awareness with shared view of the system; and (4) The ATCOs were open and confident to use the system in its’ mature form. The findings show that the MR-based tangible airport digital tower system has high potential in collaborative ATM operations by improving user performance and user experience. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human-robot collaboration is becoming increasingly popular in the manufacturing industry, opening the door to a large range of applications by combining the complementary skills of the human worker and the robot. Collaborative robots are also a solution to decrease the operator workload and indirectly reduce the risk of occupational injuries such as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). The latter represents one of the major causes of absenteeism at work. Thanks to the development of human tracking devices, it is possible to monitor the operator, analyze the postures, and assess the associated MSD risk. In this paper, we present a novel ergonomics optimization framework that performs postural optimization based on the virtual element method. A feedback interface is developed whereby the user is informed about non-ergonomic postures and an improved body pose is proposed. The workpiece position controller module acts on the cobot end-effector and indirectly on the co-manipulated part in such a way that the operator's posture is improved. The framework was validated by a user study performed on a human-robot collaboration task whereby the subject polishes a part hold by the robot. The conducted study of the user's perception and REBA scores showed promising results. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the problem of non-ergonomic posture of workers in hybrid workcells. The proposed approach makes use of virtual elements (springs and dampers) to build a mechanical model of the human body posture and perform postural optimization. The obtained body joint angles are fed into two modules of the framework. First, a graphical interface displays the current pose of the user and proposes to him the improved posture. Second, a controller adapts the pose of the workpiece hold by the collaborative robot. This is realized by computing a displacement vector between the wrist current and optimized positions. The use of such a framework was demonstrated on a collaborative polishing task whereby the robot adjusts the position of the workpiece. After a user study test with 10 participants, joint data were collected and the REBA scores of different subtasks were measured and compared. The results from these preliminary experiments showed that the proposed approach improves the human body postures and offers a promising solution to enhance ergonomics by the robot assistance in case of robotic workcells. The conducted survey also shows an overall positive subject's perception of the system.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Earth transcendence requires humans to extend their robotic and physical presence to the rest of the solar system. The Low Earth Orbital environment has been a proving ground for developing long duration human exploratory technologies for six decades and the Moon is an essential next step for building and testing surface-based technologies as we push outward. Lunar proximity and resource availability make it an optimal location to both stage and prepare for missions to Mars. Sub-surface water ice and mineral rich regolith makes Mars a vital destination for deploying sustainable, off-world infrastructure. Resource rich asteroids for fueling industries on Earth and in space necessitate autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic infrastructure supporting crewed planetary missions. Earth based analogs are vital simulation elements for these complex endeavors. Analogues provide flight-like scenarios which improve mission success and reduce risk. This “Super Mars Yard” built for NASA in Lucerne Valley, California, will test and validate human robotic elements present in their Innovation to Flight (i2F) program. Utilizing the CRADLE (California Research Analog for Deep Space and Lunar Exploration) facilities in Lucerne allows i2F participants to operate in a high-fidelity testbed featuring “end-to-end” mission simulations. The i2F environment enables human-in-loop simulation and testing for planetary operations using exploration hardware such as rovers, robots, and landing/ascent vehicles. Future goals include validating of human-rated technologies, pressurized modules, and tele-robotic operations that may help to identify and address unforeseen challenges before embarking on actual missions. These experiences may involve human-machine interactions, such as assistive autonomous and semi-autonomous tools/systems for human psychology, medical and scientific operations, and surface based interplanetary communications systems and robotic infrastructure assembly. Mission planners and mission controllers have an analog platform for real-time mission support in a twin- like scenario. i2F initiatives during the summer of 2019 found mechanisms to integrate humans and robots in high-fidelity scenarios that will decrease crews' workload for reduced-gravity human operations. Next year i2F plans to perform a trade study comparing various habitat construction techniques in collaboration with NASA to address the agencies simulation preferences. Through the simulation of both technical, operational and even legal scenarios, these efforts will improve mission safety, execution and value. The JPL i2F program helps close the gap between evolving technologies and flight heritage. The CRADLE facility helps provide rapid iteration and design augmentation while testing and validating future technologies alongside human factors requirements.

AB  - The nuclear industry is faced with a pressing need to reduce operating costs in order to remain competitive with other forms of electric generation. While current industry initiatives are focused on incremental gains by streamlining work processes and reducing worker burdens, very few, if any, involve significant reductions in the base workload of a nuclear plant. Migration to a fully-integrated control room affords just such an opportunity. This report describes an NPP digital instrumentation and control (I&C) system design, along with its corresponding human systems interface (HSI) design, which achieves high plant availability, while selectively applying digital equipment redundancy and integrating traditional I&C system partitions, to minimize the digital equipment needed, and thereby minimize initial installation costs and ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. An additional key component of digital equipment minimization is optimization of the digital interface to conventional plant sensors and controlled plant devices (e.g., pumps, valves), which requires no disturbance to plant cables and results in eliminating thousands of electro-mechanical relay control components. The design is rooted in the highly integrated digital technology applied to the most recent advanced light water reactors under United States (U.S.) Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) design certification review and approval. While this design employs technology from new plants, that technology has been adapted to the modernization of current operating NPPs. Hence, the highly integrated digital I&C and HSI design is referred to as the compact control room digital modernization (CDM). Along with minimal digital equipment, the corresponding HSI design employs compact operator workstations with visual display units (VDU) and soft controls for both the main control room (MCR) and remote shutdown room (RSR), to immediately improve human performance and ultimately facilitate operating staff reduction. Some advanced light water reactors have demonstrated this staff reduction through full scope simulator testing of normal and abnormal plant conditions, with U.S. licensed operating crews from currently-operating U.S. plants. Digital equipment minimization, compact operator workstations, and optimized plant component interfaces that require no disturbance to field cables, also facilitate implementation of the CDM over multiple phases, most of which can be conducted during normal refueling shutdown windows. This phased implementation method includes a novel transition of the I&C, MCR and RSR with an operations centered focus. This paper presents the CDM design, along with qualitative cost/benefit comparisons to currently operating plants with conventional analog I&C and HSI technology; this generation of I&C/HSI is referred to as a conventional control room (CCR). A CCR also includes NPPs that have been upgraded with digital systems, but retain the current partitions between plant I&C systems (i.e., no I&C integration) and retain the current plant system to control board configuration of current NPP control rooms. Even though these comparisons are qualitative, a compelling case is presented for the CDM. Copyright © (2017) by American Nuclear Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) systems are becoming common tools in industrial workplaces. However, factory workers are still concerned about whether head-mounted display (HMD)-based AR systems distract their awareness of the environment and therefore pose safety risks. The purpose of this study was to assess users' experience of real-world awareness when using an AR system. 19 study participants played a wooden block logic game in a laboratory with three different setups: real, AR and virtual reality (VR). Based on this study, it can be concluded that HMD-based AR systems do not decrease users’ awareness of their surroundings if the virtual content is minimal and the task is done while seated. However, it was seen that more research in this area with more interactive virtual content is required. This study is an important step in understanding how AR may affect future work in industrial and safety-critical environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In general, it is important to understand drivers of safety performance. The issue of hydrocarbon leaks on offshore platforms is one of the most important safety performance indicators based on risk related to major accidents. In this study, a longitudinal design was used to investigate the relationships between work climate and hydrocarbon leaks from a broader organizational perspective. Confirmatory factor analyses tested on a sample of offshore workers ( N= 3320), supported the validity of the Scandinavian Work Climate Instrument (SWCI). Complementary results also supported the measurement model. Pearson's correlations indicated significant associations between work climate dimensions and hydrocarbon leaks occurring in the post survey period. All correlations were negative, supporting the proposed hypothesis. Generally, the results supported the assumption and model that guided the overall investigation. Specifically, work climate was associated with safety performance. The findings indicated that several work climate factors could function as leading indicators, implying that the work climate approach has been underestimated in safety research. Correlations with hydrocarbon leaks indicate that the organizational factors explored in this study can predict different levels of leaks. This suggests that the work climate approach used in this study represents an important contribution to achieving a holistic understanding of safety performance. Future research should replicate the study design in other settings and investigate the possibility of exploring relationships with other types of safety performance indicators using SWCI. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Within the software development industry, human resources have been recognized as one of the most decisive and scarce resources. Today, the retention of skilled IT (information technology) personnel is a major issue for employers and recruiters as well, since IT career abandonment is a common practice and means not only the loss of personnel, knowledge, and skills, but also the loss of business opportunities. This article seeks to discover the main motivations young practitioners abandon the software career. To achieve this objective, two studies were conducted. The first study was qualitative (performed through semistructured interviews) and intended to discover the main variables affecting software career abandonment. The second study was quantitative, consisting of a Web-based survey developed from the output of the first study and administered to a sample of 148 IT practitioners. Results show that work-related, psychological, and emotional variable are the most relevant group of variables explaining IT career abandonment. More specifically, the three most important variables that motivate employees to abandon the career are effort-reward imbalance, perceived workload, and emotional exhaustion. In contrast, variables such as politics and infighting, uncool work, and insufficient resources influence to a lesser extent the decision to leave the career. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: It is established that shiftwork causes sleep loss and circadian misalignment. Individuals who work non-traditional day shifts that encroach into typical sleep times, such as those in the service and transportation sectors, may also experience sleep and circadian disruption. We aimed to determine how neurobehavioral performance and sleep would be affected by work start time among individuals working a non-traditional daytime shift pattern. Methods: We collected sleep diaries, wrist-worn actigraphy (CamNtech, Cambridge UK), and the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) from 44 pilots (4F) who worked a shift rotation consisting of a five-day baseline block starting in the mid-morning (baseline), five early shifts (early), five high workload midday shifts (midday), and five days of late shifts (late), each separated by 3–4 days off. Results: Mixed-model analysis revealed that individuals obtained less sleep when working the early shifts (5.70 ± 0.73 h) relative to baseline (6.78 ± 0.86 h; P <.01). Sleep duration declined significantly from the beginning to the end of late shifts (P =.003). All shifts were associated with decreased reaction time on the PVT relative to baseline (236 ± 48; early, 257 ± 70 ms; midday 261 ± 62 ms; late 266 ± 64 ms; P <.01 for all). Conclusions: We found that non-traditional day shifts encroach on an individual's sleep opportunity and such shifts could be a contributing factor to the high prevalence of sleep deficiency observed in modern society. Our findings suggest that it would be prudent for industries requiring such shifts to expand fatigue risk management training to individuals classified as day shift workers. © 2018

AB  - Some employees tend to drink more alcohol than other employees, with costs to personal and organizational well-being. Based on a self-control framework, we propose that emotional labor with customers-effortfully amplifying, faking, and suppressing emotional expressions (i.e., surface acting)-predicts alcohol consumption, and that this relationship varies depending on job expectations for self-control (i.e., autonomy) and personal self-control traits (i.e., impulsivity). We test these predictions with data drawn from a national probability sample of U.S. workers, focusing on employees with daily contact with outsiders (N = 1,592). The alcohol outcomes included heavy drinking and drinking after work. Overall, surface acting was robustly related to heavy drinking, even after controlling for demographics, job demands, and negative affectivity, consistent with an explanation of impaired self-control. Surface acting predicted drinking after work only for employees with low self-control jobs or traits; this effect was exacerbated for those with service encounters (i.e., customers and the public) and buffered for those with service relationships (i.e., patients, students, and clients). We discuss what these results mean for emotional labor and propose directions for helping the large segment of U.S. employees in public facing occupations. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Employee morale is a determinant of productivity and retention. This study explores relationships and morale levels between employees and supervisors in a large service industry. An open-ended questionnaire developed based on literature was created to assess morale and motivation, support, incentive, workplace environment, way of motivation, and job satisfaction. This survey was then piloted to managers of hourly product handlers working in a large North American distribution company. Data on existing status of employee morale and the factors influencing morale were collected from managers of three different departments responsible for supervising product handlers. The survey was administered using an online survey tool and answered by a sample of 44 respondents. Poor employee morale and negative attitudes toward their jobs were reported. Influencing factors included minimal pay and hours, lack of motivation, understaffed and unskilled labor, high physical workload, and poor supervision. Manager feedback indicated employees had a lack of understand of company mission and vision but also demonstrated a potential disconnect at the worker and manager levels. Potential interventions such as increasing employee-supervisor interaction, promoting good behavior, offering non-monetary benefits, training, wage rate and employee selection consistency, job redesign, etc. were recommended to management for implementation to improve existing conditions. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The task of wall painting produces considerable risk to the workers, both male and female, primarily in the development of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. Insufficient information is currently available regarding the potential benefits of using different paint roller designs or the possible adverse effects of painting at different work heights. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of gender, work height, and paint tool design on shoulder muscle activity and exerted forces during wall painting. Ten young adults, five male and five female, were recruited to perform simulated wall painting at three different work heights with three different paint roller designs while upper extremity muscle activity and horizontal push force were recorded. Results demonstrated that for female participants, significantly greater total average (p=0.007) and integrated (p=0.047) muscle activity was present while using the conventional and curly flex paint roller designs compared to the proposed design in which the load was distributed between both hands. Additionally, for both genders, the high working height imposed greater muscular demands compared to middle and low heights. These findings suggest that, if possible, avoid painting at extreme heights (low or high) and that for female painters, consider a roller that requires the use of two hands; this will reduce fatigue onset and subsequently mitigate potential musculoskeletal shoulder injury risks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Exploring the oceans, much like space, requires innovative solutions and new technology. The growing demand to protect, exploit and learn about some of our most precious resources calls for particular knowledge and skills to respond to the challenges of a harsh and unforgiving environment. The new Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree (EMJMD) Programme in Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR) (http://www.master-mir.eu) combines robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance marine and maritime science and its technological applications. It aims at building the capacity to enable advances in far reaching sea exploration, autonomous deep sea robots, teleoperations and the use of AI in these endeavours. The MIR programme is shaped to provide training in data science and state of the art applied robotics targeted at enhancing the efficiency, health, safety and environmental performance of the offshore industry and maritime operations. The EMJMD MIR programme offers competitive scholarships to welcome students worldwide and provides them with a common space to develop their shared passion for marine robotics and AI. The programme fosters cultural exchange and sharing of individual experiences. The master's is conducted by a consortium of 4 well-established academic institutions in the domain of marine robotics research. The institutions are in 4 countries France (UTLN), Norway (NTNU), Portugal (UL-IST) and Spain (UJI), for which the ocean has played a key role in history and is anchored in society. The goal of the programme is to develop specialists in marine and maritime intelligent robotic systems, providing them with: a) a solid theoretical background in the marine physical processes and technical skills in robotics engineering control systems and sensors, b) grounded knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, enabling them to develop cutting edge robotics solutions to real world challenges, c) applied knowledge in subsea and maritime application fields, including blue growth of maritime and offshore sectors, as well as deep sea surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, subsea resources exploration, offshore structure maintenance, e-navigation and maritime security enhancement.Students completing the MIR Masters will be well equipped with skills and state of the art knowledge, enabling them to pursue a career in robotics engineering for the offshore oil and gas, renewable, naval, and maritime sectors. Additionally, the knowledge acquired in the use and function of intelligent robotics for the underwater environment will enable them to easily continue on to a PhD in multiple different fields, should they so desire.The programme was designed to address global challenges identified by the consortium, the gap between industry and academia, the slow convergence of AI and robotics communities and the geopolitical and cultural differences among participating countries. The MIR programme contains a growing worldwide network of more than 58 academic and industrial associate partners spanning more than 21 counmes and covering all oceans. Associate partners participate by providing industry-led lectures, internships, research collaborations and scholarships. Learning-by-doing courses cover the fundamentals of the marine environment, robotics and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the interconnections between these fields. A set of transversal skills is developed through courses in languages, scientific writing and entrepreneurship. Furthermore. the MIR consortium organises a yearly symposium hosting presentations from the students' work, keynotes from distinguished scholars, industry representatives and competitive challenges in AI and robotics.While the first year of the course takes place at UTLN, each student specialises in one of the three study tracks, encompassing a 3rd semester at one of the other main partners' institutions. Applied robotics for underwater intervention missions (UJI) aims to endow underwater robots with the capability to interact with the environment using manipulators, thus paving the way for the development of advanced systems for close-range underwater infrastructures inspection and maintenance as well as materials sampling. Safe Autonomous subsea operations (NTNU) targets increasing the level of automation and autonomy in routine or otherwise tedious operations which can improve safety, efficiency and performance, supporting the human operator in decision-making and supervision and reducing human workload. Cooperative marine robotics for scientific and commercial applications (IST-UL) focuses on groups of autonomous marine robots working in cooperation, networked via aerial, acoustic, and optical links to dramatically improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales.MIR students write a master thesis related to their study track and supervised by one of the main partners and their work is presented at the MIR annual symposium. Graduates receive a double diploma from UTLN and the institution of their study track. The MIR programme fills a gap in the current EU education landscape by responding to a pressing demand for specialists in ocean technology. It does so by building a consortium of actors around the globe with the common goal of advancing education and research in AI and robotics for ocean applications.  © 2021 MTS.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the effects of a major disaster on the management of human resources in the construction sector. It sets out to identify the construction skills challenges and the factors that affected skills availability following the 2010/2011 earthquakes in Christchurch. It is hoped that this study will provide insights for on-going reconstruction and future disaster response with respect to the problem of skills shortages. Design/methodology/approach - A triangulation method was adopted. The quantitative method, namely, a questionnaire survey, was employed to provide a baseline description. Field observations and interviews were used as a follow-up to ascertain issues and potential shortages over time. Three focus groups in the form of research workshops were convened to gain further insight into the feedback and to investigate the validity and applicability of the research findings. Findings - The earthquakes in Christchurch had compounded the pre-existing skills shortages in the country due to heightened demand from reconstruction. Skills shortages primarily existed in seismic assessment and design for land and structures, certain trades, project management and site supervision. The limited technical capability available nationally, shortage of temporary accommodation to house additional workers, time needed for trainees to become skilled workers, lack of information about reconstruction workloads and lack of operational capacity within construction organisations, were critical constraints to the resourcing of disaster recovery projects. Research limitations/implications - The research findings contribute to the debate on skills issues in construction. The study provides evidence that contributes to an improved understanding of the industry's skills vulnerability and emerging issues that would likely exist after a major disaster in a resource-limited country such as New Zealand. Practical implications - From this research, decision makers and construction organisations can gain a clear direction for improving the construction capacity and capability for on-going reconstruction. Factors that affected the post-earthquake skills availability can be considered by decision makers and construction organisations in their workforce planning for future disaster events. The recommendations will assist them in addressing skills shortages for on-going reconstruction. Originality/value - Although the study is country-specific, the findings show the nature and scale of skills challenges the construction industry is likely to face following a major disaster, and the potential issues that may compound skills shortages. It provides lessons for other disaster-prone countries where the resource pool is small and a large number of additional workers are needed to undertake reconstruction. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.

The aim is to understand how environmental compliance might compromise health and safety in the workplace. High-involvement work practices are known to affect occupational health and well-being adversely through increased stress. However, the nature and extent of job stress attributable to the activity of environmental compliance has not been previously examined among workers performing the task occasionally and as non-specialists. A case study using qualitative semi-structured interviews was implemented. Forty-one interviews including 34 ship crews and 7 managers were conducted at a UK based global shipping company and aboard two of its ships. Thematic analysis was incorporated to analyse the data. Five thematic categories reflecting job conditions which ship crews and their managers described as potentially influencing the work experience associated with environmental compliance emerged from the interviews: (1) design of tasks, (2) management style, (3) interpersonal relationships, (4) career concerns, and (5) physical conditions. On balance, the paper concludes that environmental compliance does appear to influence the health and well-being of ship crews in negative ways, in particular by inducing job demands which add to the heavy workload and long working hours that ship crews are already faced with. Understanding the impact of compliance on longer term health is essential. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dougong [斗栱] is a bracket between column, beam, and rafter in traditional timber structure building in China. It has several bearing blocks, named dou [斗], and some bracket arms, named gong [栱]. All components are connected by sunmao [榫卯]. It was born from the capital and later developed into a bracket that does not have to be related to the column. During the last 3000 years, its status in traditional architecture has been rising. In the Qing Dynasty, the architectural design work started it as the core. The chief aim of this research is to explore the possibility and key issues of using dougong for the prefabricated buildings. This research documents a folk building project in China from three aspects: the construction organization, the dougong component manufacture and assembly. After that, we study the mechanism and analyze the traditional technology. Finally, the study provides some suggestions for the prefabricated building. The first aspect is the construction organization. The component manufacture team needs more specialized skills than the assembly team. The two teams exchange information through the code on components and simple language. The proportion of dougong manufacture workload on the standard floor is 40%. The second aspect is the dougong component manufacture. A master carpenter, a chief engineer, is in charge of three tasks: architectural design, material requirements planning, and templates making. After that, he directed 4 carpenters to make components accorded with the templates. The dougong components are universal. Besides, carpenters assemble and code the completed gong components in layers in the carpentry yard. Each layer of gong uses 1 English capital letter to code. The other components are unassembled and uncoded. The third aspect is the dougong component assembly. The assembly team's workers need only simple skills to complete their work. Limited by the low precision of the hand-made method, they need to fine-tune the size of the gong at the joint between the gong and the column. In this project, the lowest component of dougong is gong, so, the workers assemble 5 layers of gongs into the columns from bottom to top first, and then assemble several dous between the gongs. The completed sunmaos at this stage are not tightly fitted, which leaves room for adjustment of the upper components of the dougong. The research we have done indicates that compared with the assembly stage, the manufacturing stage is a concentrated section of the technology and workload. So, the key to modernizing traditional buildings is the modernization of this stage, especially the dougong manufacture. If it is realized, we can save at least 40% hand-made workload of the standard floor. At the same time, the components will achieve higher accuracy, which is beneficial to improve the assembly speed and quality. Also, in the future, BIM can be utilized based on the traditional design method, which is significant to the inheritance and improvement of dougong technology. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Nowadays, the current market trend is oriented toward increasing mass customization, meaning that modern production systems have to be able to be flexible but also highly productive. This is due to the fact that we are still living in the so-called Industry 4.0, with its cornerstone of high-productivity systems. However, there is also a migration toward Industry 5.0 that includes the human-centered design of the workplace as one of its principles. This means that the operators have to be put in the center of the design techniques in order to maximize their wellness. Among the wide set of new technologies, collaborative robots (cobots) represent one such technology that modern production systems are trying to integrate, because of their characteristic of working directly with the human operators, allowing for a mix of the flexibility of the manual systems with the productivity of the automated ones. This paper focuses on the impact that these technologies have on different levels within a production plant and on the improvement of the collaborative experience. At the workstation level, the control methodologies are investigated and developed: technologies such as computer vision and augmented reality can be applied to aid and guide the activities of the cobot, in order to obtain the following results. The first is an increase in the overall productivity generated by the reduction of idle times and safety stops and the minimization of the effort required to the operator during the work. This can be achieved through a multiobjective task allocation which aims to simultaneoulsy minimize the makespan, for productivity requirements, and the operator’s energy expenditure and mental workload, for wellness requirements. The second is a safe, human-centered, workspace in which collisions can be avoided in real time. This can be achieved by using real-time multicamera systems and skeleton tracking to constantly know where the operator is in the work cell. The system will offer the possibility of directing feedback based on the discrepancies between the physical world and the virtual models in order to dynamically reallocate the tasks to the resources if the requirements are not satisfied anymore. This allows the application of the technology to sectors that require constant process control, improving also the human–robot interaction: the human operator and the cobot are not merely two single resources working in the same cell, but they can achieve a real human–robot collaboration. In this paper, a framework is preented that allows us to reach the different aforementioned goals. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Extreme learning machine (ELM) is widely used in various fields because of its advantages such as short training time and good generalization performance. The input weights and bias of hidden layer of traditional ELM are generated randomly, and the number of hidden layer nodes is determined by artificial experience. Only by adjusting parameters manually can an appropriate network structure be found. This training method is complex and time-consuming, which increases the workload of workers. To solve this problem, the incremental extreme learning machine (I-ELM) is used to determine the appropriate number of hidden layer nodes and construct a compact network structure in this paper. At the same time, a new hidden layer activation function STR is proposed, which avoids the disadvantages of incomplete output information of hidden layer due to uneven distribution of sample data. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by public data sets and applied to the classification of superheat degree (SD) in aluminum electrolysis industry. The experimental results show that STR activation function has a good learning speed, and the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing SD identification algorithm in terms of accuracy and robustness.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) panel surface-defect detection technology is crucial for the PV industry to perform smart maintenance. Using computer vision technology to detect PV panel surface defects can ensure better accuracy while reducing the workload of traditional worker field inspections. However, multiple tiny defects on the PV panel surface and the high similarity between different defects make it challenging to accurately identify and detect such defects. This paper proposes an approach named Ghost convolution with BottleneckCSP and a tiny target prediction head incorporating YOLOv5 (GBH-YOLOv5) for PV panel defect detection. To ensure better accuracy on multiscale targets, the BottleneckCSP module is introduced to add a prediction head for tiny target detection to alleviate tiny defect misses, using Ghost convolution to improve the model inference speed and reduce the number of parameters. First, the original image is compressed and cropped to enlarge the defect size physically. Then, the processed images are input into GBH-YOLOv5, and the depth features are extracted through network processing based on Ghost convolution, the application of the BottleneckCSP module, and the prediction head of tiny targets. Finally, the extracted features are classified by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a Path Aggregation Network (PAN) structure. Meanwhile, we compare our method with state-of-the-art methods to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed PV panel surface-defect detection network improves the mAP performance by at least 27.8%. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - For some older people and their families, live-in care offers a way of continuing to live independently at home in their local community. While research in the care industry has consistently highlighted the effects of caring on workers, little research has specifically explored the experiences of live-in carers. The current study examines the ways in which live-in carers construct their role, the different challenges they face and the strategies they use to mitigate them. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 21 live-in carers in the United Kingdom and the data were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings suggest that carers perceive their role as complex and characterised by a heavy workload and tiredness. Participants emphasised the variability which was introduced to the role as a function of the quality of agency support, the character and condition of the client, and the carer's relationships with the client's family. Participants' accounts reflected an acknowledgement of the need to orient and respond constantly to the needs and routine of the client. While this orientation was recognised as necessary for effectively fulfilling the demands of the role, it was also linked to feelings of dislocation and loss of identity. Drawing on understandings of personal and social identity, the implications of these findings for the psychological wellbeing of live-in carers and organisational support are discussed.

AB  - The fast development of image recognition and information technology has influenced people's life and industry management mode not only in some common fields such as information management, but also has very much improved the working efficiency of various industries. In the healthcare field, the current highly disparate doctor-patient ratio leads to more and more doctors needing to undertake more and more patient treatment tasks. Back muscle image detection can also be considered a task in medical image processing. Similar to medical image processing, back muscle detection requires first processing the back image and extracting semantic features by convolutional neural networks, and then training classifiers to identify specific disease symptoms. To alleviate the workload of doctors in recognizing CT slices and ultrasound detection images and to improve the efficiency of remote communication and interaction between doctors and patients, this paper designs and implements a medical image recognition cloud system based on semantic segmentation of CT images and ultrasound recognition images. Accurate detection of back muscles was achieved using the cloud platform and convolutional neural network algorithm. Upon final testing, the algorithm of this system partially meets the accuracy requirements proposed by the requirements. The medical image recognition system established based on this semantic segmentation algorithm is able to handle all aspects of medical workers and patients in general in a stable manner and can perform image segmentation processing quickly within the required range. Then, this paper explores the effect of muscle activity on the lumbar region based on this system.  © 2022 Xuanye Qi.

AB  - Music often plays an important role in people’s daily lives. Because it has the power to affect human emotion, music has gained a place in work environments and in sports training as a way to enhance the performance of particular tasks. Studies have shown that office workers perform certain jobs better and joggers run longer distances when listening to music. However, a personalized music system which can automatically recommend songs according to user’s physiological response remains absent. Therefore, this study aims to establish an intelligent music selection system for individual users to enhance their learning performance. We first created an emotional music database using data analytics classifications. During testing, innovative wearable sensing devices were used to detect heart rate variability (HRV) in experiments, which subsequently guided music selection. User emotions were then analyzed and appropriate songs were selected by using the proposed application software (App). Machine learning was used to record user preference, ensuring accurate and precise classification. Significant results generated through experimental validation indicate that this system generates high satisfaction levels, does not increase mental workload, and improves users’ performance. Under the trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the continuing development of wearable devices, the proposed system could stimulate innovative applications for smart factory, home, and health care. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Recent advances in physiological monitoring devices have supported the diffusion of a human-centric approach also within industrial contexts, where often severe working conditions limit the analysis of the operators' User eXperience (UX). Several methodologies have been presented to the scientific community to assess the overall UX of workers performing industrial operations. These methodologies have also tried to encompass the diverse aspects of the physiological response (e.g., mental workload, stress conditions and postural overloads). The current study aims to refine a unique and comprehensive UX index to identify the specific causes of the user discomfort in advance and to optimize the overall system design. A full set of non-invasive wearable devices was applied to a virtual reality (VR) simulation while performing manual operations to collect relevant physiological parameters and to finally assess the overall UX. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed index in anticipating the operator's critical conditions by specifying the possible causes of the ergonomic discomfort. Future works will focus on investigating the theoretical foundation of proposed solution and on providing a statistical validation on a larger population.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - It is not unusual to observe that actual schedule and quality performances are different from planned performances (e.g., schedule delay and rework) during a construction project. Such differences often result in production pressure (e.g., being pressed to work faster). Previous studies demonstrated that such production pressure negatively affects safety performance. However, the process by which production pressure influences safety performance, and to what extent, has not been fully investigated. As a result, the impact of production pressure has not been incorporated much into safety management in practice. In an effort to address this issue, this paper examines how production pressure relates to safety performance over time by identifying their feedback processes. A conceptual causal loop diagram is created to identify the relationship between schedule and quality performances (e.g., schedule delays and rework) and the components related to a safety program (e.g., workers' perceptions of safety, safety training, safety supervision, and crew size). A case study is then experimentally undertaken to investigate this relationship with accident occurrence with the use of data collected from a construction site; the case study is used to build a System Dynamics (SD) model. The SD model, then, is validated through inequality statistics analysis. Sensitivity analysis and statistical screening techniques further permit an evaluation of the impact of the managerial components on accident occurrence. The results of the case study indicate that schedule delays and rework are the critical factors affecting accident occurrence for the monitored project. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although additive combinations of age and work environment characteristics have been found to predict sleep impairment, possible age x work environment interactions have been largely disregarded. The present study examined linear and curvilinear interactions of age with work environment measures in relation to sleep quality and duration. Survey data were collected from offshore day-shift personnel (= 901). Main effects and interactions of the age terms with work environment measures (job demand, control, and social support, physical environment and strenuous work) were evaluated. Sleep duration was predicted by a curvilinear interaction, age2 x job demand (< .005), and by the age x social support interaction (< .002); sleep quality was predicted by age x job demand (< .002). Job control and physical environment showed significant additive effects. At a time when older employees are encouraged to remain in the workforce, the findings serve to increase understanding of how ageing and work demands jointly contribute to sleep impairment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Quality Assurance (QA) is a critical tool for the success of projects under cross-border construction logistics and supply chain (Cb-CLSC). However, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed challenges that have affected the adequacy of QA of Cb-CLSC, and this has received limited attention in scholarly reports. Thus, this study aims to identify the critical challenges of QA of Cb-CLSC amid the pandemic by conducting an international expert survey with 102 experts across 25 economies/countries. Sentiment analysis is performed further to understand how the critical challenges have influenced the QA of Cb-CLSC using the negative-neutral-positive model. The study’s finding identified ten critical challenges of QA of Cb-CLSC amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the top five critical challenges comprising “shortage of raw construction material”, “changes in work practices”, “halting of operations and site closure”, “heavy workloads and shortage of construction workers”, and “design changes”. Aside from the negativity imposed by the pandemic, the sentiments on each critical challenge portrayed positivity and neutrality that empowers the industry, denoting that the pandemic comes with opportunities that may be harnessed to position the QA of Cb-CLSC to be adequate for the post-pandemic era and endure the risks of future pandemics. This study contributes theoretically and practically by identifying and creating awareness of the critical challenges of the QA of Cb-CLSC. This could help practitioners, researchers, and policymakers develop a resilience framework based on innovative management strategies to position the QA of Cb-CLSC adequately for the post-pandemic era and endure the risks of future pandemics. © 2023 by CITC-13.

AB  -                              It has been long known that there is a significant potential for industrial radiography personnel to receive non-trivial occupational exposure. In some cases, workers may receive high exposure which can even cause severe health consequences such as radiation burns                             (1)                             . As such, it is of utmost importance to have a mechanism to ensure sharing and exchanging knowledge and experience for improving occupational radiation protection in industrial radiography. The international experts group organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Working Group on Industrial Radiography (WGIR), has suggested to create an online tool, the Information System on Occupational Exposure in Medicine, Industry and Research (ISEMIR): Industrial Radiography so called ISEMIR-IR. ISEMIR-IR is an online database for radiation protection optimization for nondestructive testing companies carrying out industrial radiography. ISEMIR-IR is developed as a web-based tool for a regular data collection and analysis of occupational doses for individuals, and for the use of this information to improve occupational radiation protection. It assists non-destructive testing (NDT) companies in benchmarking their arrangements in radiation protection and safety, and hence in promoting of, and in implementation of optimization of occupational radiation protection. ISEMIR-IR online system was designed based on the data from an extensive research of and results of the worldwide surveys. In 2010, surveys were sent to three different actors and responses were received from 432 industrial radiographers from 31 countries, 95 NDT companies from 29 countries, and 59 national regulatory bodies. In order to gain insights into practice of occupational radiation protection, questions referred to radiation protection procedures in place, training, incidents, safety of radiographers, and the use of radioactive sources. Shortcomings identified in all world regions were a lacking use of collimators/diaphragms, survey meters not as widely available as they should have been, a high frequency of incidents, occupational doses received by radiographers varied considerably with no correlation to a radiographic workload.                          © 2018 NDT 2018 - 57th Annual Conference of the British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing.

AB  - In the last two decades, several serious accidents at large-scale technological systems that have had grave consequences, such as that at Bhopal, have primarily been attributed to human error. However, further investigations have revealed that humans are not the primary cause of these accidents, but have inherited the problems and difficulties of working with complex systems created by engineers. The operators have to comprehend malfunctions in real time, respond quickly, and make rapid decisions to return operational units to normal conditions, but under these circumstances, the mental workload of operators rises sharply, and a mental workload that is too high increases the rate of error. Therefore, cognivitive human features such as situation awareness (SA) - one of the most important prerequisite for decision-making - should be considered and analyzed appropriately. This paper applys the SA Error Taxonomy methodology to analyze the role of SA in three different accidents: (1) A runaway chemical reaction at Institute, West Virginia killing two employees, injuring eight people, and requiring the evacuation of more than 40,000 residents adjacent to the facility, (2) The ignition of a vapor cloud at Bellwood, Illinois that killed one person, injured two employees, and caused significant business interruption, and (3) An explosion at Ontario, California injuring four workers and caused extensive damage to the facility. In addition, the paper presents certain requirements for cognitive operator support system development and operator training under abnormal situations to promote operators' SA in the process industry. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Big data frameworks are widely deployed in supercomputers for analyzing large-scale datasets. Topological data processing is an emerging approach that focuses on analyzing the topological structures in high-dimensional scientific data. However, incorporating topological data processing into current big data frameworks presents three main challenges: (1) The frequent data exchange poses challenges to the traditional coarse-grained parallelism. (2) The spatial topology makes parallel programming harder using oversimplified MapReduce APIs. (3) The massive intermediate data and NUMA architecture hinder resource utilization and scalability on novel supercomputers and many-core processors. In this paper, we present Topo, a generic distributed framework that enhances topological data processing on many-core supercomputers. Topo relies on three concepts. (1) It employs fine-grained parallelism, with awareness of topological structures in datasets, to support interactions among collaborative workers before each shuffle phase. (2) It provides intuitive APIs for topological data operations. (3) It implements efficient collective I/O and NUMA-aware dynamic task scheduling to improve multi-threading and load balancing. We evaluate Topo's performance on the Tianhe-3 supercomputer, which utilizes state-of-the-art ARM many-core processors. Experimental results of execution time show that compared to popular frameworks, Topo achieves an average speedup of 5.3× and 6.3×, with a maximum speedup of 8.4× and 20×, on HPC workloads and big data benchmarks, respectively. Topo further reduces total execution time on processing skewed datasets by 41%. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Surface and underground mining, due to its technical challenges, is considered a hazardous industry. The great majority of accidents and fatalities are frequently associated with ineffective or inappropriate training methods. Knowing that knowledge of occupational accident causes plays a significant role in safety management systems, it is important to systematise this kind of information. The primary objective of this systematic review was to find evidence of work-related accidents involving machinery and their causes and, thus, to provide relevant data available to improve the mining project (design). The Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement methodology was used to conduct the review. This paper provides the main research results based on a systematic review protocol registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), where the research strategy, information sources, and eligibility criteria are provided. From the 3071 articles identified, 16 were considered eligible and added to the study. Results are presented in a narrative-based form, with additional data provided in descriptive tables. The data analysed showed that the equipment often related to mining accidents are conveyor belts, haul trucks, and dumpers, especially during maintenance or repair activities. Attention should be paid to powered tools. Effective monitoring and machine operation control are some of the stated measures to minimise accidents. Particular attention should be paid to less experienced and senior workers, mainly through fatigue control, workload management, and appropriate training programs. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Apache Storm has recently emerged as an attractive fault-tolerant open-source distributed data processing platform that has been chosen by many industry leaders to develop real-time applications for processing a huge amount of data in a scalable manner. A key aspect to achieve the best performance in this system lies on the design of an efficient scheduler for component execution, called topology, on the available computing resources. In response to workload fluctuations, we propose an advanced scheduler for Apache Storm that provides improved performance with highly dynamic behavior. While enforcing the required Quality-of-Service (QoS) of individual data streams, the controller allocates computing resources based on decisions that consider the future states of non-controllable disturbance parameters, e.g. arriving rate of tuples or resource utilization in each worker node. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed solution with two well-known alternatives, namely the Storm's default scheduler and the best-effort approach (i.e. the heuristic that is based on the first-fit decreasing approximation algorithm). Experimental results clearly show that the proposed controller increases the overall resource utilization by 31% on average compared to the two others solutions, without significant negative impact on the QoS enforcement level. © 2016 IEEE.
