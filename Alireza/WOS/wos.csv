As part of Industry 4.0, a human operator possesses various characteristics, but cannot be consistently understood as well as a machine. Thus, human-machine interaction plays an important role. This study focuses on incumbent challenges on the basis of estimated mental states. Given the operation logs from data recording hardware, a Hidden Markov model on top of a human cognitive model was trained to capture a production line worker's sequential faults. Our study found that retaining workers' attention is insufficient and tracking the state of perception is key to accomplishing production tasks. A safe workflow policy requires attention and perception. Accordingly, our proposed Petri Net enhances operation safety and improves production efficiency.","[Chen, Chao-Nan] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Ph D Program Management & Engn Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan; [Liu, Tung-Kuan] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Automat Engn, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan; [Chen, Yenming J.] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Logist Management, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Liu, TK (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Automat Engn, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan.;Chen, YMJ (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Logist Management, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan.",mj.ceo@msa.hinet.net; tkliuaiia@gmail.com; yjjchen@nkust.edu.tw,"Chen, Chaonan/AAE-1207-2019","Chen, Yenming J./0000-0003-3072-0917","Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [107-2221-E-992-092, 107-2410-H-992-014-MY2]","Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan grant number 107-2221-E-992-092 and 107-2410-H-992-014-MY2.,,24,7,7,1,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Most of the published papers on assembly line balancing problems (ALBP) are focused only on the task processing times. However, this may cause an overload in work assignments for certain workers. A work-overload may cause fatigue and thus lead to a decrease in line efficiency and factory productivity, and also result in an increase in quality problems and work-related injuries. To avoid the negative implications of work-overload conditions, this paper assigns tasks among workstations without exceeding the cycle time or the age and gender-adjusted physical workload capacity (PWLC). We propose a regression model to determine age and gender-based PWLC. Six different age categories are analyzed to show the impacts of age and gender on PWLC. We propose a binary (0-1) integer linear programming (BILP) for ALWABP, where age and gender-adjusted PWLC is considered. The efficiency of the model is shown on test problems and a real-life application in a textile firm. An ALWABP is considered taking into account the processing times and physical workloads for a textile factory assembly line of 53 tasks. The numbers of stations for ALWABP without and with the physical workload in the textile firm assembly line case are 5 and 6, respectively. All workstations are balanced in terms of physical workload and processing times. The results show that advancing average age increases the number of stations (NS), and this situation triggers a reduction in line efficiency (LE) and PWLC utilization ratio.","[Efe, Burak] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Konya, Turkey; [Kremer, Gul E.

Consequently, businesses from different sectors were forced to work remotely. At the same time, research in this area has seen a rise in studying and emerging technologies that allow and promote such a remote working style; not every sector is equipped for such a transition. The manufacturing sector especially, has faced challenges in this respect. This paper investigates the mental workload (MWL) of two groups of participants through a human-machine interaction task. Participants were required to bring a robotised cell to full production by tuning system and dispensing process parameters. Following the experiment, a self-assessment of the participants' perceived MWL using the raw NASA Task Load Index (RTLX) was collected. The results reveal that remote participants tend to have a lower perceived workload compared to the local participants, but mental demand was deemed higher while performance was rated lower.","[Zimmer, Melanie; Al-Yacoub, Ali; Ferreira, Pedro; Hubbard, Ella-Mae; Lohse, Niels] Loughborough Univ, Intelligent Automat Ctr, Wolfson Sch, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Al-Yacoub, A (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Intelligent Automat Ctr, Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",a.al-yacoub@lboro.ac.uk,"Lohse, Niels/AAB-6597-2021; Ferreira, Pedro/JVN-2767-2024; Hubbard, Ella-Mae/I-4291-2014","Lohse, Niels/0000-0001-7279-8849; Al-Yacoub, Ali/0000-0003-2010-9882",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L014998/1]; EPSRC [EP/R032718/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L014998/1].,,26,0,0,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2169-3277,,PROD MANUF RES,Prod.

In this study, social aspect is treated by considering the worker's tiredness in assembly lines. To explain the problem, an illustrative example is given to show the importance of the worker's tiredness in determining their salaries. Two distinct assignment scenarios are examined revealing that opting for a specific type of resource results in cost savings compared to utilizing diverse resources.

In this regard, this paper presents a framework for formalizing human-machine manufacturing systems. The human-machine system considered in this paper consists of the following three main components: a human supervisor; several cells, each of which is composed of a human operator and a machine; and interfaces. A human operator interacts with a machine in a cell and performs manufacturing tasks based on commands given by the supervisor. Meanwhile, the supervisor is responsible for performing exception handling tasks in response to unanticipated events reported by the cells. With the proposed model, desirable specifications are constructed, which include a condition free of mode confusion, manufacturing task goal reachability, and exception handling task supportability in human-machine manufacturing systems. It is also suggested that adaptive automation with varying levels of information abstraction to humans can be accommodated by the proposed framework. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate the formal models and specifications and the applicability of adaptive automation with a case study of a simple chair assembly system.","[Joo, Taejong; Shin, Dongmin] Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Shin, D (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.",mrjoo512@hanyang.ac.kr; dmshin@hanyang.ac.kr,,"Shin, Dongmin/0000-0003-1785-4603",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT [2017R1A2B4012582],Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT,This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2017R1A2B4012582).

This study advances beyond conventional Industry 4.0 frameworks by introducing a novel fatigue model that emphasizes ergonomic risk management during the design phase of robotic assembly lines. Utilizing a hybrid model that employs a fuzzy inference system based on ergonomist knowledge, this fuzzy approach manages the imprecise nature of ergonomic optimization more accurately than deterministic models and effectively reflects real-world complexities. By evaluating fatigue at both task and worker levels, this fuzzy inference mechanism addresses technical aspects through feasibility studies and significantly improves ergonomic outcomes. The integration of supportive robots is explored through scenario-based analysis, highlighting productivity enhancements and substantial ergonomic benefits in line with Industry 5.0's focus on enhancing worker well-being and operational resilience. The proposed heuristic algorithm enables decision-makers to identify the most efficient solutions tailored to individual preferences, showcasing flexibility and real-world applicability. Empirical validation, enriched with synthesized ergonomic-oriented instances, confirms the superiority of this approach in creating more sustainable and ergonomically optimized assembly lines. Implementing this approach is predicted to decrease system costs by up to 47%, particularly advantageous during human resources crises, by reducing ergonomic risk, recovery needs, and additional capacity requirements for fatigue mitigation. This study contributes to the discourse on the practical implications of Industry 5.0 and demonstrates its applicability in designing ergonomically optimized assembly lines that prioritize long-term productivity and worker satisfaction.","[Ghorbani, Elham; Keivanpour, Samira; Sekkay, Firdaous; Imbeau, Daniel] Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal,"Ghorbani, E (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",elham.ghorbani-totkaleh@polymtl.ca,,,Mitacs,Mitacs,No Statement Available,,54,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

Regarding objective metrics, the results showed that the task completion time was reduced for some AR devices (projectors, monitors, tablets, smartphones), whereas the use of the head-mounted display (HMD) increased task-completion time; moreover, the error rate was reduced with any AR device compared with traditional methods. Regarding subjective metrics, the analysis underlined that operator perceived a lower workload with the HMD or the monitor compared with traditional methods.

This automated task scheduling system has been successfully deployed within Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd Company, and the performance of this new application used by a group of engineers under real-world operational conditions have been assessed and analysed.","[Lewandowski, R.; Olszewska, J.

Background Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. Method Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. Results Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by then-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. Conclusion This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times. Application Results are applicable to the assessment of the effects of high cognitive workload in manufacturing.","[Biondi, Francesco N.; Cacanindin, Angela; Cort, Joel] Univ Windsor, Dept Kinesiol, 2555 Coll Ave, Winsdor, ON, Canada; [Douglas, Caitlyn] Univ Windsor, Winsdor, ON, Canada; [Biondi, Francesco N.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA",University of Windsor; University of Windsor; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Biondi, FN (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Kinesiol, 2555 Coll Ave, Winsdor, ON, Canada.",francesco.biondi@uwindsor.ca,"biondi, francesco/B-4512-2013","Biondi, Francesco N./0000-0002-5558-4707",University of Windsor-SSHRC Explore program; Mitacs,University of Windsor-SSHRC Explore program; Mitacs,The authors acknowledge the collaboration of the personnel at the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Windsor and the funding from the University of Windsor-SSHRC Explore program and Mitacs.,,30,32,36,5,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Humans will remain indispensable to control and manage these fleets of robots, particularly in safety-critical applications. However, a human operator's cognitive capacities can be challenged and exceeded as the sizes of autonomous fleets grow, and more sophisticated AI techniques can lead to opaque robot control programs. In a user study (n = 40), we explore how autonomous swarm intelligence algorithms and novel tangible interaction modalities relate to subjective and physiological indices of operator cognitive load (i.e., NASA Task Load Index, heart rate variability). Our findings suggest that there are differences in workload across conditions; however, subjective and cardiac measures appear to be sensitive to different aspects of cognitive state. The results hint at the potential of both tangible interfaces and automation to engage operators and reduce cognitive load, yet show the need for further validation of workload measures for use in studying and optimizing human-swarm interactions.","[Paas, Anita; Coffey, Emily B.

As an effective way to increase the flexibility in a short time with a small investment, multi-skilled workers have received more attention in recent years. In this paper, a multi-skilled worker assignment problem is solved in the context of seru production systems, in which differences in workers' skill sets and proficiency levels are taken into consideration. Worker grouping, cell loading, and task assignment are solved concurrently in the problem. A mathematical model with objectives of improving the inter-seru and inter-worker workload balance is proposed to solve the problem. In order to verify the proposed model, a numerical example is presented and solved by a sum weighted method. Due to the NP-hard nature of the model, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on NSGA-II is developed. The algorithm is tested by several numerical examples and the impact of differences in workers' competency on workload balance is analyzed based on the computational results.","[Lian, Jie; Li, WenJuan] Xian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, ChenGuang] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yin, Yong] Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Business, Kyoto 6028580, Japan",Xi'an University of Technology; Northwestern Polytechnical University; Doshisha University,"Liu, CG (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liuc@nwpu.edu.cn,"Li, Wenjuan/AAE-4027-2019; Liu, Chenguang/AAC-4849-2021",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671139, 71371153, 71171161]; National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China [2016JM7005]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China","The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and constructive suggestions.

Moreover, monitoring tasks can impose different levels of workload on the human operator leading to an increased risk of making serious errors. The present research aims at developing an adaptive assistance system for these types of tasks that is able to monitor a worker's current level of mental workload and provides support without reducing the worker's autonomy and sense of responsibility. We report results of an experiment using a monitoring task incorporating repeated event sequences to simulate underlying workings of a complex system.

The first is an ergonomic analysis of the workstations to evaluate the physical workload of different jobs. An in-house risk assessment method was used to identify physical workloads of each job. In the second step, a mathematical model was developed to schedule job rotation and optimize/balance the cumulative workload. Mixed integer programming is proposed to implement a platform for the ergonomic job rotation. The objective of the job rotation programming in this research was to determine the optimal sequence of jobs for each worker such that the global daily workload of the workers would be balanced.

This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program -synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the pro-gramming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation.

This problem consists of determining the best assignment of the assembly tasks to workers as well as the workers to workstations in accordance with some desired objectives. Task times differ depending on worker skills. Two optimization criteria are considered to be minimized, the cycle time and the smoothness index of the workload of the line. The efficiency of the proposed MOEA is evaluated over a set of benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature. A suitable performance analysis is deployed concerning the quality of the Pareto solutions. The results demonstrate a very satisfactory performance in terms of solution quality.

Despite the design of a command channel from human operators to robots, most existing studies on teleoperation fail to focus on the design of the feedback channel from the robot to the human operator, which plays a crucial role in reducing the cognitive load, particularly in precise and concentrated manufacturing tasks. This paper focuses on designing a feedback channel for the cognitive interface between a human operator and a robot considering human cognition. Current studies on human-robot cognitive interfaces in robot teleoperation are extensively surveyed. Further, the modalities of human cognition that foster understanding and transparency during teleoperation are identified. In addition, the human-robot cognitive interface, which utilizes the proposed multi-modal feedback channel, is developed on a teleoperated robotic grasping system as a case study. Finally, a series of experiments based on different modal feedback channels are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing the performance of the teleoperated grasping of fragile products and reducing the cognitive load via the objective aspects of experimental results and the subjective aspects of operator feedback.","[Zheng, Chen; Wang, Kangning; Gao, Shiqi; Yu, Yang; Wang, Zhanxi] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 127 West Youyi Rd, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Chen] CSSC Huangpu Wenchong Shipbuilding Co Ltd, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Adv Welding Technol Ships, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yunlong] Monash Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Melbourne 3168, Australia; [Tang, Yunlong] Monash Univ, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Melbourne, 3168, Australia",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Monash University; Monash University,"Tang, YL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Melbourne 3168, Australia.;Tang, YL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Mat Sci & Engn Dept, Melbourne, 3168, Australia.",yunlong.tang1@monash.edu,,,Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022M712933]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51805437]; [2023-JC-YB-299],Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));,"This work was supported by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Grant No. 2023-JC-YB-299), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2022M712933) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51805437).",,54,0,0,13,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0956-5515,1572-8145,,J INTELL MANUF,J.

Different from the manufacturing environment where the traditional assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) rises, manual or semimanual manufacturing enjoys much higher flexibility allowing multiple workers to perform the same set of tasks on workpieces in the same workstation in parallel. The freedom of specifying the number of workers in workstations makes the classic NP-hard ALBP even harder to solve. A heuristic-mixed genetic algorithm (hGA) is therefore proposed to solve the problem. The algorithm minimizes cycle time as its first objective and balances workload among workstations as its second objective. A maximum-utilization heuristic and a bisection search are integrated into the decoding process of hGA so that the optimization of task assignment and worker allocation is accomplished simultaneously. Numerical results and a real-life application demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of hGA.","[Qian, Xiongwen] Shenzhen Technol Univ, Sch Urban Transportat & Logist, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shenzhen Technology University,"Qian, XW (corresponding author), Shenzhen Technol Univ, Sch Urban Transportat & Logist, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",qianxiongwen@sztu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72101162],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 72101162).,,20,2,3,3,10,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupa-tional ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics.

System models that ignore human workers yield suboptimal results in product design and system improvement.Purpose: In the aircraft industry, worker workload is of primary concern as most tasks are performed manually, leading to general fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders. Robot assistance could improve quality, efficiency and relieve workers from fatigue. To demonstrate the feasibility and value of integrating human performance models in system design at Airbus, a Worker Fatigue Model was developed, focusing on the effects of (1) automation (manual vs semi-automated), and (2) workforce makeup (various ratios of high-skilled to low-skilled workers). Our ultimate goal was to inform the development of effective policies and strategies for human-technology integration in Industry 5.0.Methods: We developed the Worker Fatigue Model by adapting existing fatigue models for workers in industrial environments and by considering worker characteristics, tasks, and the presence or absence of robot-assistance. Two different scenarios were simulated (fully manual and semi-automated), with input variables such as worker skill, age, and motivation, and output variables including overall fatigue and error probabilities were evaluated. The Worker Fatigue Model was integrated into the Airbus system model to conduct trade studies based on workforce characteristics.Results: Our findings revealed that the composition of the workforce (i.e., various ratios of high-skilled to low-skilled workers), alongside specific manufacturing technologies, significantly reduced worker fatigue, especially with higher ratios of high-skilled workers, and improved overall industrial system performance.Conclusions: Although applying our Worker Fatigue Model effectively demonstrated the feasibility and value of integrating human factors into early industrial system design, it remains a work in progress.

Based on capabilities considerations, workload, and performance estimations, the task allocator assigns the sub-task to human or robot agent. The algorithm was validated on the assembly of a crusher unit of a smoothie machine using the collaborative Franka Emika Panda robot and showed promising results in terms of productivity thanks to task parallelization, with improvement of more than 30% of the total assembly time with respect to a collaborative scenario, where the agents perform the tasks sequentially.","[El Makrini, Ilias; Omidi, Mohsen; Vanderborght, Bram] Vrije Univ Brussel, Robot & Multibody Mech Res Grp, Brussels, Belgium; [El Makrini, Ilias] Flanders Make, Flexible Assembly, Lommel, Belgium; [Fusaro, Fabio; Lamon, Edoardo; Ajoudani, Arash] Ist Italiano Tecnol, HRI2 Lab, Via Morego 30, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Omidi, Mohsen; Vanderborght, Bram] Interuniver Microelect Ctr IMEC, Leuven, Belgium; [Fusaro, Fabio] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Polytechnic University of Milan,"El Makrini, I (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Robot & Multibody Mech Res Grp, Brussels, Belgium.;El Makrini, I (corresponding author), Flanders Make, Flexible Assembly, Lommel, Belgium.",Ilias.El.Makrini@vub.be,"Lamon, Edoardo/HSF-4729-2023; Vanderborght, Bram/A-1599-2008","Omidi, Mohsen/0000-0002-0691-4183; Lamon, Edoardo/0000-0002-5526-2337; Fusaro, Fabio/0000-0002-3909-7941; El Makrini, Ilias/0000-0002-9980-517X",European Union [871237]; Flanders Make through the programme Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen of the Flemish Government,European Union(European Union (EU)); Flanders Make through the programme Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen of the Flemish Government,This work was supported by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 871237 (SOPHIA) and Flanders Make through the programme Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen of the Flemish Government.,,27,5,5,3,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-0858,,978-1-6654-7927-1,IEEE INT C INT ROBOT,,,2022,,,,,,,10238.0,10244.0,,10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981618,0.0,,,7,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BU4YE,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-11-14,WOS:000909405302078,0,

ALWABP occurs when task times vary according to the assigned worker. Although the operation time of a task is assumed to be fixed in classical assembly lines, it depends on the operator who executes the task in ALWABP. In ALWABP literature, the primary and secondary objectives are minimizing cycle time and balancing workload among workstations smoothly, respectively. When smoothing workload, only task times are taken into consideration in the relevant literature. However, degree of difficulty of tasks is also very important. Two workers executing two different stations with the same station time are assumed to be equally loaded according to the traditional perception. In fact, even they have the same station time; their workloads are different because of the different tasks they execute, in real life assembly line configurations. In order to close this gap between the real life and the literature, this study introduces an ALWABP problem with considering ergonomic risk factors (ErgoALWABP). Due to the complex nature of the problem, optimum seeking methods are not capable of solving it. So, the proposed problem is tackled with the multiple-rule based constructive randomized search approach. Also, OCcupational Repetitive Action method is used for making ergonomic risk assessment. Performance of the proposed solution procedure is compared with the relevant literature on benchmark data. Experimental results show that ergonomic environment could be improved when ergonomic risk factors are taken into account.","[Akyol, Sebnem Demirkol; Baykasoglu, Adil] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Baykasoglu, A (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Izmir, Turkey.",adil.baykasoglu@deu.edu.tr,"Akyol, Sebnem/P-7859-2019; Baykasoglu, Adil/G-4311-2010; Cimen, Tolga/D-4590-2016","Baykasoglu, Adil/0000-0002-4952-7239; Demirkol Akyol, Sebnem/0000-0001-6106-388X; Cimen, Tolga/0000-0002-9620-8097",,,,,26,42,45,5,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0956-5515,1572-8145,,J INTELL MANUF,J.

However, related research is limited, especially, the problem of cross-trained worker assignment. The purpose of this paper is to solve this problem for two representative seru types, divisional and rotating seru, and subsequently, compare throughput performance between the two seru types under reasonable worker-task assignment. Design/methodology/approach For the cross-trained worker assignment problem, this research presents new models aiming at maximum throughput of seru and workload balance of workers under considering skill levels (SLs) and several practical constraints. Furthermore, factorial experiments that involve four factors, the number of tasks (NT), gap of task time, SL and gap of SL, are performed to compare throughput performance between divisional and rotating seru. Findings First, the maximum throughput of the divisional seru is better than that of the rotating seru under suitable worker assignment. Second, in the seru which has less difference of task time, throughput performance of the rotating seru is better than the divisional seru when the NT is close to the number of assigned workers. Moreover, the influence tendency of the four factors on throughput gap between the two seru types is significant. Originality/value This research addresses the worker-task assignment for divisional and rotating seru based on their characteristics. Several findings can help decision maker select more applicable seru type according to various production environments from the perspective of optimum throughput.","[Wu, Lang] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Chan, Felix T.

Human-robot collaboration promises high advantages in manufacturing regarding automation, productivity, accuracy as well as flexibility in production. This technology is really challenging but requires redesigning of assembly lines to effectively involve the available human- and robot-resources. As robots can collaborate with humans sharing the assembly tasks in the same workstation, production managers experience an increasingly complex ALBP setting. Moreover, a crucial issue raised within this context is the variance and uncertainty in processing times for manual (human) work. Processing times for human work are subject to the nature and skills of the human worker. We explore the heuristic solution of this NP-hard problem using a problem-specific metaheuristic. Our aim is to investigate the effects of utilizing collaborate robots in manual assembly lines with respect to both production rate and workload smoothing. Simulation experiments on a reallife case study borrowed from the literature show how to tackle the problem under uncertainty (fuzziness) in task processing times.","[Zacharia, Paraskevi Th.; Xidias, Elias K.; Nearchou, Andreas C.] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm, Management Informat Syst & Business Intelligence L, Patras, Greece; [Zacharia, Paraskevi Th.] Univ West Attica, Dept Ind Design & Prod Engn, Aigaleo, Greece; [Xidias, Elias K.] Univ Aegean, Dept Prod & Syst Design Engn, Syros, Greece",University of Patras; University of West Attica; University of Aegean,"Nearchou, AC (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm, Management Informat Syst & Business Intelligence L, Patras, Greece.",nearchou@upatras.gr,"Xidias, Elias/AAS-2876-2021; Nearchou, Andreas/B-9059-2014","Nearchou, Andreas/0000-0002-5525-8661; Xidias, Elias/0000-0002-6228-4577",,,,,34,4,4,11,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

They perform a set of specialised tasks multiple times daily. Under a situation of high demand disruption (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic), the overproduction rate would lead inventory levels to soar. An approach to cope with these demand drops and ongoing workforce costs is to dismiss employees and rebalance the line. Nevertheless, this implies social and economic costs related to rehiring and training. Alternatively, agreements can be made to reduce workload with a proportional wage deduction. These decisions are particularly challenging in heterogeneous workforces. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to address the Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Rebalancing Problem (ALWARP). Our model aims at preserving jobs while minimising labour costs. We consider scenarios with falling demands and impose regularity metrics on workload reductions. Computational tests on benchmark datasets show that our strategy can distribute social costs among workers, with only slightly higher cumulative labour hours, while avoiding inconveniences associated with future renovations. A real-world case study of a truck cabin assembly line is investigated: the model can easily incorporate many realistic features and decide which workers should have their workload reduced and at which rate.","[Michels, Adalberto Sato; Costa, Alysson M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Michels, AS (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",a.satomichels@unimelb.edu.au,"Sato Michels, Adalberto/HHS-0776-2022; Costa, Alysson/C-2375-2009","Costa, Alysson M/0000-0002-3135-793X; Sato Michels, Adalberto/0000-0003-2635-9700",,,,,51,4,5,5,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

In seru implementation, cross-trained worker assignment is a vital problem. Most previous studies focused on assigning cross-trained workers into pure divisional or rotating seru separately, but overlooked the problem for a hybrid seru production system that includes both seru types. This research fills this gap by minimizing the makespan and balancing the workers' workload of each seru in a bi-objective mathematical model. For medium-scale instances, the exact solutions are obtained. For large-scale instances, we propose an NSGA-II-based memetic algorithm that uses two-level encoding and incorporates the bat algorithm as a local search and two K-means-based NSGA-II algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that the K-means-based NSGA-II not only outperforms other algorithms with respect to common proximity and diversity metrics but also runs an order of magnitude faster (in seconds versus minutes required by others on the same computer). Some management insights are obtained based on many numerical experiments.","[Liu, Feng] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Niu, Ben; Wu, Lang; Feng, Yuanyue] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Xing, Muze] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Shenzhen University; Xiamen University,"Wu, L (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",wulang1016@126.com,"NIU, BEN/IYS-2016-2023","Niu, Ben/0000-0001-5822-8743","NSFC [71872033, 71971143]; Ministry of Education Program in Humanities and Social Sciences [20YJC630157]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310567, 2019A1515110194]; 2020 LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program [XLYC2007061]",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education Program in Humanities and Social Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); 2020 LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program,"This work was supported by the NSFC [grant numbers 71872033 and 71971143] , the Ministry of Education Program in Humanities and Social Sciences [grant number 20YJC630157, Project name: Study on optimizing resource allocation of seru production system with bottleneck shifting under capacity sharing mechanism] , the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [grant numbers 2018A030310567 and 2019A1515110194] , and the 2020 LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program (XLYC2007061) .

The research explicated in this paper is conducted in a pen recycling unit in the southern part of India which is an initiative by a non-profit organization to reduce plastic waste and highlight the need for recycling. The objectives of the study are two-fold. Firstly, to investigate the influence of cognitive aspects namely information and material presentation on worker performance in an assembly line and secondly to propose an economical worker allocation approach based on the findings of the first study considering the pen recycling unit. An experimental study was conducted with fifteen workers and was given eight different scenarios with the combinations of presenting material and information with six pen varieties for assembly. The performance of workers is identified and appropriate allocations are made to suitable workstations. Further, a subjective measurement using NASA-TLX is also done to determine the mental workload of workers. The results indicate that individual worker performance varies significantly, much more than is assumed. This variation is due to the difference in cognitive capabilities among workers when they are introduced to different product variants and work environments. It is expected that the proposed economical allocation method will be beneficial for similar micro, small and medium enterprises that contribute in achieving sustainability goals.","[Giridhar, M.

In a virtual reality simulation study, human mental workload effects were analyzed in human-robot interactions (HRI) with variations in design requirements regarding human factors and ergonomics (HFE) as well as occupational safety and health (OSH). Each of 20 participants performed his/her own task while interacting with two virtual robots in a manufacturing environment. Results on task performance indicated relative lower human mental workload when robots acted on lower level of robot autonomy (lower LORA) and the human operator was informed about upcoming HRI by multi-modal signaling (Information Aid 'on'). However, this pattern of workload reflected in performance measures, was not reflected in mental workload ratings. Hence, compensational adjustments in operator performance were assumed. It was concluded, that a combination of less autonomous robots and multi-modal feedback result in relatively less operator distraction from task performance and, thus, less impairment in operator workload. HFE and OSH may improve when HRI is audio-visually indicated and robot activities are adapted to human operator task requirements (low LORA). Therefore, results have the potential to inform future design of HRI regarding HFE and OSH at different workplaces in industry and services.","[Kaufeld, Mara] Fraunhofer Inst Commun Informat Proc & Ergon FKIE, Human Factors, Bonn, Germany; [Nickel, Peter] German Social Accid Insurance IFA, Inst Occupat Safety & Hlth, Accid Prevent Prod Safety, St Augustin, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Kaufeld, M (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Commun Informat Proc & Ergon FKIE, Human Factors, Bonn, Germany.",mara.kaufeld@fkie.fraunhofer.de; peter.nickel@dguv.de,,"Nickel, Peter/0000-0002-4418-5495",,,,,38,8,8,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-22215-4; 978-3-030-22216-1,IN SY AP IN WE HC,,,2019,11581.0,,,,,,278.0,291.0,,10.1007/978-3-030-22216-1_21,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ergonomics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering,BX4GG,,,,,2024-11-14,WOS:001289296800021,0,Human-robot interaction; Work systems design; Occupational safety and health; Virtual reality; Mental workload; Human-automation interaction; Human-system interaction

In the framework of Industry 5.0, humans are working alongside cobots to accomplish the required level of automation. However, human-robot interaction has brought up concerns regarding human factors (HF) and ergonomics. A human worker may experience cognitive stress as a result of cobots' irresponsive nature in unpredictably occurring situations, which adversely affects productivity. Therefore, there is a necessity to measure stress to enhance a human worker's performance in a human-robot collaborative environment. In this study, factory workers' mental workload was assessed using physiological, behavioural, and subjective measures. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were collected to acquire brain signals and track hemodynamic activity, respectively. The effect of task complexity, cobot movement speed, and cobot payload capacity on the mental stress of a human worker were observed for a task designed in the context of a smart factory. Task complexity and cobot speed proved to be more impactful. As physiological measures are unbiased and more authentic means to estimate stress, eventually they may replace the other conventional measures if they prove to correlate with the results of traditional ones. Here, regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were utilised to determine the correlation between physiological data and subjective and behavioural measures. Regression performed better for most of the targets and the best correlation (rsq-adj = 0.654146) was achieved for predicting missed beeps, a behavioural measure, using a combination of multiple EEG and fNIRS predictors. The k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm was used to evaluate the accuracy of correlation between traditional measures and physiological variables, with the highest accuracy of 77.8% achieved for missed beeps as the target. Results show that physiological measures can be more insightful and have the tendency to replace other biased parameters.","[Zakeri, Zohreh; Arif, Arshia; Omurtag, Ahmet; Breedon, Philip; Khalid, Azfar] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England",Nottingham Trent University,"Zakeri, Z (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England.",zohreh.zakeri@ntu.ac.uk; arshia.arif2021@my.ntu.ac.uk; ahmet.omurtag@ntu.ac.uk; philip.breedon@ntu.ac.uk; azfar.khalid@ntu.ac.uk,,"Khalid, Azfar/0000-0001-5270-6599; OMURTAG, AHMET/0000-0002-3773-8506","This research has received funding from Connected Everything (CE II) Feasibility Studies, Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC Award reference No. 4811539) and PepsiCo Europe.

This revolution came about with the arrival of new technologies that promise to change the way humans work and interact with each other and with machines. It aims to improve the cooperation between humans and machines for mutual enrichment. This would be done by leveraging human knowledge and experience, and by reactively balancing some complex or complicated tasks with intelligent systems. To achieve this objective, methodological approaches based on experimental studies should be followed to ensure a proper evaluation of human-machine system design choices. This paper proposes an experimental study based on a platform that uses an intelligent manufacturing system made up of mobile robots, autonomous shuttles using the principle of intelligent products, and manufacturing robots in the context of Manufacturing 4.0. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of teamwork human-machine cooperation, performance, and workload of the human operator. The results showed a lower level of participants' assessment of time demand and physical demand in teamwork conditions. It was also found that the team working improves the subjective human operator Know-how-to-cooperate when controlling the autonomous shuttles. Moreover, the results showed that in addition to the work organization, other personal parameters, such as the frequency of playing video games could affect the performance and state of the human operator. They raised the importance of further analysis to determine cooperative patterns in a group of humans that can be adapted to improve human-machine cooperation.","[Habib, Lydia; Pacaux-Lemoine, Marie-Pierre; Berdal, Quentin; Trentesaux, Damien] Univ Polytech Hauts France, UMR 8201, CNRS, LAMIH, F-59313 Valenciennes, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Polytechnique Hauts-de-France,"Pacaux-Lemoine, MP (corresponding author), Univ Polytech Hauts France, UMR 8201, CNRS, LAMIH, F-59313 Valenciennes, France.",habib.lydia.1993@gmail.com; marie-pierre.lemoine@uphf.fr; quentin.berdal@uphf.fr; damien.trentesaux@uphf.fr,"; Trentesaux, Damien/D-2791-2009","Pacaux-Lemoine, Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-7486-5723; Berdal, Quentin/0009-0004-0545-8624; Trentesaux, Damien/0000-0003-2489-6203",HUMANISM research program - ANR Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-17-CE10-0009]; SUCRe project - Hauts-de-France regional council; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE10-0009] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),HUMANISM research program - ANR Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); SUCRe project - Hauts-de-France regional council; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research was funded by HUMANISM No ANR-17-CE10-0009 research program, funded by the ANR Agence Nationale de la Recherche, and by SUCRe project, funded by the Hauts-de-France regional council.",,33,6,6,5,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,NOV,2021,9.0,11,,,,,,,1910,10.3390/pr9111910,0.0,,,21,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,XG6KF,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-14,WOS:000724858900001,0,industry 4.0 & nbsp; ; intelligent manufacturing system; human-machine cooperation; PERFORMANCE; CONTEXT

However, to date, these projections have not explicitly addressed policies designed to mitigate the dangers and health risks that are just as important, if not more than task performance considerations in such settings. We developed in-situ projections for three different use cases: (1) assembly support at a workbench, (2) ergonomic lifting, (3) restricted areas, which we studied with 15 representative target users. We found the expected benefits of the task-supporting projection (use case 1), increasing task performance and causing minimal cognitive load. However, our data also suggest that the other projections (use case 2 and 3) did not improve policy compliance. Our findings indicate that in-situ projections are not the most suitable solution to nudge workers to policy compliance in an industrial assembly setting, as most participants ignored the policy after evaluating the dangers themselves. Furthermore, based on our limitations and findings, we reflect on how current study practices can be improved for ubiquitous systems, especially when aiding policy compliance.","[Wedral, Aaron; Vrecar, Rafael; Weiss, Astrid] Tech Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria; [Ebenhofer, Gerhard; Poenitz, Thomas; Wuehrer, Paul H.; Stuebl, Gernot] PROFACTOR GmbH, Steyr Gleink 4407, Upper Austria, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien; Upper Austrian Research GmbH; PROFACTOR,"Wedral, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria.",aaron.wedral@tuwien.ac.at; rafael.vrecar@tuwien.ac.at; gerhard.ebenhofer@profactor.at; thomas.poenitz@profactor.at; paul.wuehrer@profactor.at; astrid.weiss@tuwien.ac.at; gernot.stuebl@profactor.at,,,"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme within the project TEAMING.AI [957402]; country of Upper Austria as part of the FTI strategy, project Zer0P","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme within the project TEAMING.AI; country of Upper Austria as part of the FTI strategy, project Zer0P","This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme within the project TEAMING.AI (grant number 957402) as well as by the country of Upper Austria as part of the FTI strategy, project Zer0P.",,40,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-42282-9; 978-3-031-42283-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2023,14143.0,,,,,,574.0,594.0,,10.1007/978-3-031-42283-6_31,0.0,,,21,"Computer Science, Cybernetics; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX4JE,,,,,2024-11-14,WOS:001290141800031,0,Spatial Augmented Reality; Pose Estimation; Human Machine Interaction; Learnability; Cognitive Load; Ergonomic Notifications; Collaborative Robot Safety Zone Awareness; Manual Assembly Assistance; Industrial Assembly; INDUSTRY 4.0; USABILITY

In assembly systems, RC inspires the development of walking worker assembly line (WWAL). On the other hand, U-type assembly lines (UALs) may provide higher worker utilization, lower space requirement and more convenient internal logistics when compared to straight assembly lines. In this context, this study aims to improve assembly line performance by generating RC cycles on WWAL with respect to task assignment characteristics of UAL within reasonable walking distance and space requirement. Therefore, a novel line configuration, namely, segmented rabbit chase-oriented U-type assembly line (SRCUAL), emerges. Design/methodology/approach The mathematical programming approach treats SRCUAL balancing problem in a hierarchical manner to decrease computational burden. Firstly, segments are generated via the first linear programming model in the solution approach for balancing SRCUALs to minimize total number of workers. Then, stations are determined within each segment for forward and backward sections separately using two different pre-emptive goal programming models. Moreover, three heuristics are developed to provide solution quality with computational efficiency. Findings The proposed mathematical programming approach is applied to the light-emitting diode (LED) luminaire assembly section of a manufacturing company. The adaptation of SRCUAL decreased the number of workers by 15.4% and the space requirement by 17.7% for LED luminaire assembly system when compared to UAL. Moreover, satisfactory results for the proposed heuristics were obtained in terms of deviation from lower bound, especially for SRCUAL heuristics I and II. Moreover, the results indicate that the integration of RC not only decreased the number of workers in 40.28% (29 instances) of test problems in U-lines, but also yielded less number of buffer points (48.48%) with lower workload deviation (75%) among workers in terms of coefficient of variation. Practical implications This study provides convenience for capacity management (assessing capacity and adjusting capacity by changing the number of workers) for industrial SRCUAL applications. Meanwhile, SRCUAL applications give the opportunity to increase the capacity for a product or transfer the saved capacity to the assembly of other products. As it is possible to provide one-piece flow with equal workloads via walking workers, SRCUAL has the potential for quick realization of defects and better lead time performance. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, forward-backward task assignments in U-type lines have not been adapted to WWALs. Moreover, as workers travel overall the line in WWALs, walking time increases drastically. Addressing this research gap and limitation, the main innovative aspect of this study can be considered as the proposal of a new line design (i.e. SRCUAL) which is sourced from the hybridization of UALs and WWAL as well as the segmentation of the line with RC cycles. The superiority of SRCUAL over WWAL and UAL was also discussed. Moreover, operating systematic for SRCUAL was devised. As for methodical aspect, this study is the first attempt to solve the balancing problem for SRCUAL design.","[Cevikcan, Emre; Durmusoglu, Mehmet Bulent] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Cevikcan, E (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.",cevikcan@itu.edu.tr; durmusoglum@itu.edu.tr,"Durmusoglu, Mehmet/ABD-3901-2020; Cevikcan, Emre/S-5115-2019","Durmusoglu, Mehmet/0000-0002-5007-8899; Cevikcan, Emre/0000-0001-5109-5458",,,,,108,2,2,2,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-5154,1758-4078,,ASSEMBLY AUTOM,Assem.

Understanding the factors influencing assembly errors is critical for quality improvement. The sequence of assembly operations, a factor markedly affecting cognitive load, remains largely understudied. We aimed to assess the effect of changing the sequence of assembly operations on error rates through four field experiments conducted in a car manufacturing plant. The parts (and errors) under study were child lock labels (missing labels), sunroofs (missing bolts), windshield wiper arms (loose bolts), and armrests (wrong selection). Parts were chosen based on data from quality records, and they represent different scenarios regarding the sequencing of assembly operations. Minitab was used to conduct the statistical test for two proportions at a significance level of 0.05. The experiments ran for a period varying from 9 to 25 weeks (22292 to 138456 cars). All four experiments exhibited significant differences in the proportion of errors. MODAPTS cycle-time calculations revealed no negative effect of assembly sequence variations on productivity. The study findings show that changing the assembly operation sequence can reduce the error rates, possibly due to the intermediary effect in reducing the operator's cognitive load. Overall, realizing quality improvement requires optimizing the assembly operation sequence in terms of time and productivity while considering its possible impact on error rates.","[Real, Carlos] Sandalwood Engn & Ergon, Livonia, MI 48152 USA; [Torres, Yaniel] Univ Antioquia, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Medellin 050010, Colombia",Universidad de Antioquia,"Real, C (corresponding author), Sandalwood Engn & Ergon, Livonia, MI 48152 USA.",creal@sandalwood.com,"Real, Carlos/KCL-5170-2024",,,,,,74,1,1,3,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12.0,,,,,,34644.0,34655.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3371980,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KO6Z9,,gold,,,2024-11-14,WOS:001180961100001,0,Manufacturing; Error analysis; Task analysis; Production; Manuals; Workstations; Assembly systems; Human factors; Load flow; Quality control; Automotive engineering; human factors; cognitive load; quality control; automobile manufacture; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; ERGONOMICS; INSTRUCTIONS; ATTENTION; DESIGN; IMPACT; MODEL; WORK

Fluctuations or uncertainty of order becomes a problem to many logistic companies because it affects the way they have to schedule their workers. Workforce scheduling is hence necessary for allocating appropriate worker in the right place and in the right time. Inappropriate workforce scheduling could imbalance workloads within workers which leads to worker dissatisfaction. This study therefore aims to design a workforce scheduling that consider worker workload of Domestics Freight Forwarding particularly in Company X. The research will first measure the workload, both physical and mental workload. The method used for physical workload measurement is based on calorie consumptions based on Indonesia National Standard (SNI). Whereas NASA-TLX subjective approach method is used to measure mental workload. Then, by using the result of the workload measurements, a workforce scheduling model is designed to balance the workload. Goal programing is used to model the workforce scheduling. The result of workload measurement shows that workers have low productivity but high level of mental workload, while for the physical workload there is no significant difference in each warehouse and shipping. In order to increase the utility of the workers, instead of 3 shifts it is suggested that company apply 2 shifts work systems for Checker. Also, minimizing factors that reduce the productivity such the mobility of outstation (dinas luar).

Worker assignment is critical for developing a flexible and humancentered seru production system (SPS). Most studies in the literature focus on worker assignment with the objective of maximizing system efficiency, which causes an inescapable consequence that workers with high proficiency levels experience overwork compared with workers with lower proficiency levels. From the perspective of workload equity, we investigate the worker assignment problem in SPS, where the heterogeneity of workers with diverse skill sets and skill proficiency levels is taken into account. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model named the equity-oriented model is proposed for this problem to mitigate the workload inequity among workers by minimizing the maximum workload of workers. The equity-oriented model is linearized and solved by the CPLEX solver for small-scale instances. For efficiently solving large-scale instances, we design a hybrid genetic algorithm combined with local search. Computational experiments demonstrate the high performance of the hybrid genetic algorithm, both in terms of computing time and solution quality. We find that using the equity-oriented model can significantly balance the workload among workers at the cost of minimal increases in the total labor hours.","[Wu, Yinghui; Zeng, Shaoyu] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Zhenjiang 212100, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yang] Northeastern Univ, Inst Intelligent Data & Syst Engn, State Key Lab Synthet Automat Proc Ind, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University of Science & Technology; Northeastern University - China,"Wu, YH; Zeng, SY (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Zhenjiang 212100, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571037]; National Natural Science Founda-tion of China [71571037],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Founda-tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The third author is supported by [National Natural Science Foundation of China grant 71571037] .Acknowledgments.

To date, the relevant literature has not studied the DFJSPs with worker arrangement, which widely exists in practical manufacturing systems. In this paper, we investigate the DFJSP with worker arrangement (DFJSPW), where not only the factories, machines and operations, but the workers are considered simultaneously. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated for this problem. Correspondingly, an improved memetic algorithm (IMA) based on the structure of NSGA-II is proposed for the proposed DFJSPW whose objective is to minimize the makespan, maximum workload of machines and workload of workers simultaneously. In IMA, a simplified two-level encoding and four heuristic decoding methods are designed to encode and decode the individuals. A well-designed adaptive neighborhood search operator is developed to enhance the local search ability of IMA and speed its convergence. Fifty-eight benchmarks are constructed to evaluate the performance of our proposed IMA. Extensive experiments show that in most examples, IMA performs better than four well-known multi-objective algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of IMA in solving the DFJSPW.","[Luo, Qiang; Deng, Qianwang; Gong, Guiliang; Guo, Xin; Liu, Xiahui] Hunan Univ, State Key Lab Adv Design & Mfg Vehicle Body, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China; [Gong, Guiliang] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Dept Mech & Elect Engn, Changsha 410004, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Central South University of Forestry & Technology,"Deng, QW (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, State Key Lab Adv Design & Mfg Vehicle Body, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China.",qiangluo@hnu.edu.cn; deng_arbeit@hnu.edu.cn; gongguiliang@hnu.edu.cn; gotham@hnu.edu.cn; liuxiahui@hnu.edu.cn,"Luo, Qiang/IAQ-9193-2023","Luo, Qiang/0000-0002-3557-6638; deng, qianwang/0000-0003-1779-6634","National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB1712100, 2018YFB1701400]; Foshan Techno-logical Innovation Project [1920001000041]; National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China [72001217]; Nature Science Foundation of Hunan [2021JJ41081]; Natural Science Foundation of Changsha [kq2007033]; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University [71775004]; State Key Labo-ratory of Construction Machinery [SKLCM2019-03]","National Key R&D Program of China; Foshan Techno-logical Innovation Project; National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nature Science Foundation of Hunan; Natural Science Foundation of Changsha; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University; State Key Labo-ratory of Construction Machinery","Acknowledgements This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2020YFB1712100, 2018YFB1701400) ; Foshan Techno-logical Innovation Project (1920001000041) ; the National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China (grant number 72001217) ; the Nature Science Foundation of Hunan (grant number 2021JJ41081) ; the Natural Science Foundation of Changsha (grant number kq2007033) ; the State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University (grant number 71775004) ; and the State Key Labo-ratory of Construction Machinery (grant number SKLCM2019-03) .",,55,33,37,25,194,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

Employing industrial robots as the main production resource was a milestone in developing assembly lines, and emerging Industry 4.0 led industries to build collaborative assembly lines by combining robots and human operator skills. Recently, the majority of research on assembly line balancing has contributed to addressing aspects of utilizing robots in assembly lines and how they can increase line performance. Various models and methods are developed, considering different objectives and performance indicators. Despite the increasing number of studies in this area, a thorough literature review is lacking in identifying gaps, shedding light on research directions, and facilitating future development. This study systematically reviews assembly-line balancing studies targeted at assembly lines with industrial and collaborative robots. Studies are classified based on their objectives and reviewed for their solution method, line layout, and other essential specifications. A descriptive analysis is provided to assist researchers and practitioners in linking different properties of assembly lines to the objectives and applied methodologies. The results show that most studies developed models and solution methods that focused on simultaneously optimizing more than one objective. The review reveals that minimizing the cycle time is the most popular objective, and meta-heuristic algorithms are the dominant solution approaches. It is also observed that balancing assembly lines with collaborative robots has received more attention in the last five years with the emergence of Industry 4.0. The review also highlights gaps in the related literature and provides promising insights for future research.","[Fathi, Masood] Univ Skovde, Sch Engn Sci, Div Intelligent Prod Syst, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden; [Fathi, Masood; Ghobakhloo, Morteza] Uppsala Univ, Div Ind Engn & Management, POB 534, S-75121 Uppsala, Sweden; [Sepehri, Arash] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Hydraul Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Iranmanesh, Mohammad] La Trobe Univ, La Trobe Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] Asia Univ, Inst Innovat & Circular Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] China Med Univ, China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tseng, Ming-Lang] Khon Kaen Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand",University of Skovde; Uppsala University; Delft University of Technology; La Trobe University; Asia University Taiwan; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; Khon Kaen University,"Fathi, M (corresponding author), Univ Skovde, Sch Engn Sci, Div Intelligent Prod Syst, S-54128 Skovde, Sweden.",masood.fathi@his.se,"Fathi, Masood/AAW-7425-2020; Ghobakhloo, Morteza/AAF-2508-2020","Sepehri, Arash/0000-0001-6623-5265",Knowledge Foundation (KKS); Sweden's Innovation Agency via the ACCURATE 4.0 [20200181]; Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation [20200181] Funding Source: Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation,Knowledge Foundation (KKS); Sweden's Innovation Agency via the ACCURATE 4.0; Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation(Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation),"The first author, Masood Fathi, would like to acknowledge funding from the Knowledge Foundation (KKS) and Sweden's Innovation Agency via the ACCURATE 4.0 (grant agreement No. 20200181) and PREFER projects, respectively.",,117,0,0,30,30,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

We investigate several predictors of fatigue, including subjective workload estimates, sleep duration, the shift being worked, and production levels. High levels of fatigue were reported in one-third of the shifts evaluated. The main predictors of high fatigue were workload estimates, working evening shifts, and baseline fatigue. Among the six dimensions of workload, only mental demand and frustration were predictors of high fatigue. Mental demand was also rated highest. Participants reported less than seven hours of sleep in 60% of the nights evaluated. These results suggest that managers and supervisors should consider cognitive workload as a key contributing factor to fatigue in complex manual assembly. Similarly, work schedule planning should consider shift duration, start times, and end times, because of the negative influence on fatigue and the potential disruptions on sleep among workers. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: General fatigue and mental workload have been studied extensively in safety-critical contexts; wherein human performance degradation can lead to catastrophic outcomes. In the manufacturing sector, the physical demands of a job have received most of the attention because of the presence of biomechanical loads and the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders. However, in complex manual assembly, cognitive and chronobiology aspects of work can contribute to fatigue and degrade worker performance. Purpose: We aimed to evaluate self-reported levels of fatigue and workload among a group of workers performing complex assembly tasks. We also sought to investigate several predictors of fatigue, including workload estimates, sleep duration, the shift being worked, and production levels. Methods: Fourteen assembly line workers participated in a two-week study. They evaluated their levels of fatigue at the beginning and end of each shift using the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Scale. They also evaluated their workload according to the NASA-TLX scale at the end of each shift. Results: High levels of fatigue (fatigue score >= 5) were reported in approximately one-third of 114 work shifts evaluated. Binary logistic regression indicated that fatigue scores at the beginning of the shift, NASA-TLX scores, and working evening shifts were significant predictors of high levels of fatigue. Among the six dimensions measured by NASA-TLX, only mental demand and frustration were predictors of high fatigue. Mental demand was also rated highest by the workers. Participants reported less than seven hours of sleep in 60% of the nights evaluated. Conclusions: These results suggest that cognitive load can contribute to fatigue in complex manual assembly work. Circadian and homeostatic processes related to shift duration, start times, and end times are also potential contributing factors. Similarly, existing work schedules may be contributing to sleep disruptions among workers.","[Torres, Yaniel; Nadeau, Sylvie; Landau, Kurt] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Landau, Kurt] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Ergon & Human Factors, Darmstadt, Germany",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; Technical University of Darmstadt,"Torres, Y (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",yaniel.torres-medina.1@ens.etsmtl.ca,"Torres, Yaniel/IWD-8411-2023","Torres, Yaniel/0000-0002-9825-9437",MITACS [IT12360]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),MITACS; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This research was funded by MITACS, grant number IT12360 and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).",,92,8,8,3,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2472-5838,2472-5846,,IISE T OCCUP ERG HUM,IISE Trans.

Line efficiency, throughput time and workload balancing are the main concerns regarding assembly lines, due to the high volume production. Recently, specific assembly line configurations, such as two-sided and parallel lines, have been addressed by researchers within the operational levels of production. Parallel two-sided assembly lines, rather a new research area, allocate more flexible workers and reduce throughput time by incorporating the advantages of two-sided and parallel assembly lines. Since parallel two-sided assembly lines are utilized to produce large-scale products, such as automobiles, trucks, and buses in industry; they also require a significant worker movement between parallel lines because of the unavoidable walking distances between lines. In this respect, different from the existing literature, walking distances have been included in parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem with walking times and to propose the implementation of Bees Algorithm and Artificial Bee Colony algorithm due to the NP-hardness of the problem. An extensive computational study is also carried out and the comparative results are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For the optimization purpose, genetic algorithm (GA) with two new crossovers is introduced. The crossovers are developed using ranking approach and known as rank-based crossover type I and type II (RBC-I and RBC-II). These crossovers are tested against popular combinatorial crossovers using 17 benchmark problems. The computational experiment results indicated that the RBC-II has better overall performance because of the balance between divergence and guidance in the reproduction process. In future, the RBC-I and RBC-II will be tested for different variant of ALB problems.","[Kamarudin, N. H.; Rashid, M. F. F.

This interaction is, indeed, affected by the variability of human behavior and its reliability, which can strongly influence the quality, safety, and productivity standards. For this reason, this paper aims to provide a clear and complete analysis of the impacts of these technologies on the performance of operators. Design/methodology/approach: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed papers that focused on the implementation of augmented and virtual technologies in manufacturing systems and their effects on human performance. Findings: In total, 61 papers were selected and thoroughly analyzed. The findings of this study reveal that Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality can be applied for several applications in manufacturing systems with different types of devices, that involve various advantages and disadvantages. The workers performance that are influencing by the use of these technologies are above all time to complete a task, error rate and mental and physical workload. Originality/value: Over the years Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality technologies in manufacturing systems have been investigated by researchers. Several studies mostly focused on technological issues, have been conducted. The role of the operator, whose tasks may be influenced positively or negatively by the use of new devices, has been hardly ever analyzed and a deep analysis of human performance affected by these technologies is missing. This study represents a preliminary analysis to fill this gap. The results obtained from the SLR allowed us to develop a conceptual framework that investigates the current state-of-the-art knowledge about the topic and highlights gaps in the current research.","[Di Pasquale, Valentina; De Simone, Valentina; Miranda, Salvatore; Riemma, Stefano] Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, Fisciano, Italy",University of Salerno,"Di Pasquale, V (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, Fisciano, Italy.",vdipasquale@unisa.it; vadesimone@unisa.it; smiranda@unisa.it; riemma@unisa.it,"Miranda, Sergio/AAW-5325-2020; DE SIMONE, VALENTINA/HCI-0145-2022","riemma, stefano/0000-0002-2444-180X; Miranda, Salvatore/0000-0003-1377-0381; De Simone, Valentina/0000-0002-8019-6300; DI PASQUALE, VALENTINA/0000-0003-1304-3432","Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research MIUR [PRIN -2017FW8BB4]","Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The research work is part of the activities carried out in the context of the SO4SIMS project (Smart Operators 4.0 based on Simulation for Industry and Manufacturing Systems) funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research MIUR (Project PRIN -2017FW8BB4).",,72,7,7,1,11,OMNIASCIENCE,BARCELONA,"TERRASSA, BARCELONA, 00000, SPAIN",2013-8423,2013-0953,,J IND ENG MANAG-JIEM,J.

The existing Tayloristic model was replaced by a cellular teamwork model. Work enlargement and enrichment, and the improvements in workstation design and process flow increased worker satisfaction and reduced postural risk, fatigue, body pain and production waste. Workload was reduced by 42% and productivity increased by 46% (25% being attributable to unnecessary load handling, waiting and transportation, and 21% attributable directly to manufacturing times). Workers' participation in the stages of problems identification, design and evaluation of solutions played a major role in these outcomes. Relevance to industry: This study indicates that it is possible to balance ergonomics and production demands, and that it is necessary to make it clear to management. The integration of macroergonomics and production management principles increases both worker well-being and productivity levels, thus leading to a more sustainable system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The 2S-ALB problem involves different assembly resources such as worker skills, tools, and machines required for the assembly. This research modeled and optimized the 2S-ALB with resource constraints. In the end, besides favorable workload balance, the number of resources can be optimized. For optimization purpose, particle swarm optimization was modified to reduce dependence on a single best solution. This was conducted by replacing the best solution with the top three solutions in the reproduction process. Computational experiment results using 12 benchmark test problems indicated that the 2S-ALB with a resource-constrained model was able to reduce the number of resources for use in an assembly line. Furthermore, the proposed Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) was capable of searching for minimum solutions to 11 out of 12 test problems. The good performance of MPSO was attributed to its ability to maintain particle diversity over iterations. The proposed 2S-ALB model and MPSO algorithm were validated later using an industrial case study. This research makes a two-fold contribution: (a) Proposition of a novel 2S-ALB with resource-constrained model and (b) a modified PSO algorithm with enhanced performance.

It is exploited in order to assess the real-time task assignment adopted in the actual factory. The results show that, by including a learning model, it is possible to predict more accurately the long-term cycle time of the process.

Given the growing importance of HRC, this paper addresses the significance of human workload in HRC. To study workers workload an experiment was conducted using NASA-TLX questionnaire. The experiment featured two scenarios involving the same operation but varying robot motion parameters. Recognizing that individual differences contribute to success of collaboration, the experiment considered worker utilization in relation to robot motion parameters. To ensure the credibility of the experimental results, the robot motion parameters were adjusted to each individual in order to achieve the same conditions and utilization at all participants. Results revealed that worker utilization, in conjunction with robot motion parameters significantly influenced worker workload. The results highlight the need for personalized guidelines in collaborative workplaces that emphasize individual differences in abilities, skills and personalities to increase overall well-being and robot and worker productivity.

An optimization model is developed to formulate the addressed problem. Since the problem includes two different objectives, namely the minimizing the operational cost and maximum workload imbalance, the Pareto-optimal solutions are found by employing the second version of the augmented epsilon-constrained (AUGMECON2) method. To investigate the impact of qualification of workers on the system performance, a set of scenarios is constructed based on the worker skill levels. Each scenario is determined based on the nature of the worker pool in which workers are assigned to the stations. The optimization model and implemented method are validated through data taken from water-meter and elevator producers. The computational results reveal that the scenarios have a great impact on system performance. In particular, it is revealed that as the skill levels of workers increases, the quality of the Pareto-optimal solutions increase by up to 30% in terms of the comparison metrics. Therefore, an order release mechanism and worker training activities are suggested to be performed to enhance system performance.","[Yilmaz, Omer Faruk] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey",Karadeniz Technical University,"Yilmaz, ÖF (corresponding author), Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkey.",omerfarukyilmaz@ktu.edu.tr,"Yilmaz, Omer Faruk/N-4085-2016","Yilmaz, Omer Faruk/0000-0002-6202-4011",,,,,33,17,17,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1012-2443,1573-7470,,ANN MATH ARTIF INTEL,Ann.

As an extension of FSP, the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) involves parallel machine scheduling, and the worker assignment problem on assembly lines (WAPAL) involves worker allocation. Parallel machine scheduling and multi-skilled and multilevel worker allocation are both involved in the actual assembly lines of complex products, but few studies have investigated them simultaneously. This work studies a complex product assembly line scheduling problem considering multi-skilled worker assignment and parallel team scheduling and takes the maximum completion time and the imbalance degree of team workload as the optimization objective. An integer programming model is proposed, and a hybrid coding method considers the worker assignment and task order. Three improved strategies based on a multiple objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) are proposed in the local search. Finally, 20 test instances are generated based on actual enterprise labor data, and the results based on the three strategies are compared with six MOEAs. The results show that the three strategies are superior in terms of the quality and distribution of solutions.

Thus, production systems must be extremely flexible. Companies typically exploit assembly lines to manufacture produces in great volumes. The development of assembly lines distinguished by mixed or multi models increases their flexibility concerning the number of product variants able to be manufactured. However, few scientific contributions deal with customizable products, i.e., produces which can be designed and ordered requiring or not a large set of available accessories. This manuscript proposes an original two-step procedure to deal with the multi-manned assembly lines for customized product manufacturing. The first step of the procedure groups the accessories together in clusters according to a specific similarity index. The accessories belonging to a cluster are typically requested together by customers and necessitate a significant mounting time. Thus, this procedure aims to split accessories belonging to the same cluster to different assembly operators avoiding their overloads. The second procedure step consists of an innovative optimization model which defines tasks and accessory assignment to operators. Furthermore, the developed model defines the activity time schedule in compliance with the task precedencies maximizing the operator workload balance. An industrial case study is adopted to test and validate the proposed procedure. The obtained results suggest superior balancing of such assembly lines, with an average worker utilization rate greater than 90%. Furthermore, in the worst case scenario in terms of customer accessories requirement, just 4 line operators out of 16 are distinguished by a maximum workload greater than the cycle time.","[Pilati, Francesco] Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Via Sommar 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Lelli, Giovanni; Regattieri, Alberto; Ferrari, Emilio] Univ Bologna, Dept Ind Engn, Viale Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy",University of Trento; University of Bologna,"Pilati, F (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Via Sommar 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",francesco.pilati@unitn.it,,"PILATI, FRANCESCO/0000-0002-6085-0985",,,,,44,4,4,7,51,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

In such systems, workers, following each other, travel workstations in sequence by performing all of the required tasks of their own product. As the eventual stage of assembly line design, efforts should be made for capacity adjustments to meet the demand in terms of allocating tasks to workers via assembly line balancing. In this context, the purpose of this study is to address the balancing problem for multi-model walking-worker assembly systems, with the aim of improving planning capability for such systems by means of developing an optimization methodology. Design/methodology/approach - Two linear integer programming models are proposed to balance a multi-model walking-worker assembly line optimally in a sequential manner. The first mathematical programming model attempts to determine number of workers in each segment (i.e. rabbit chase loop) for each model. The second model generates stations in each segment to smooth workflow. What is more, heuristic algorithms are provided due to computational burden of mathematical programming models. Two segment generation heuristic algorithms and a station generation heuristic algorithm are provided for the addressed problem. Findings - The application of the mathematical programming approach improved the performance of a tap-off box assembly line in terms of number of workers (9.1 per cent) and non-value-added time ratio (between 27.9 and 26.1 per cent for different models) when compared to a classical assembly system design. In addition, the proposed approach (i.e. segmented walking-worker assembly line) provided a more convenient working environment (28.1 and 40.8 per cent shorter walking distance for different models) in contrast with the overall walking-worker assembly line. Meanwhile, segment generation heuristics yielded reduction in labour requirement for a considerable number (43.7 and 49.1 per cent) of test problems. Finally, gaps between the objective values and the lower bounds have been observed as 8.3 per cent (Segment Generation Heuristic 1) and 6.1 (Segment Generation Heuristic 2). Practical implications - The proposed study presents a decision support for walking-worker line balancing with high level of solution quality and computational performance for even large-sized assembly systems. That being the case, it contributes to the management of real-life assembly systems in terms of labour planning and ergonomics. Owing to the fact that the methodology has the potential of reducing labour requirement, it will present the opportunity of utilizing freed-up capacity for new lines in the start-up period or other bottleneck processes. In addition, this study offers a working environment where skill of the workers can be improved within reasonable walking distances. Originality/value - To the best knowledge of the author, workload balancing on multi-model walking-worker assembly lines with rabbit chase loop(s) has not yet been handled. Addressing this research gap, this paper presents a methodology including mathematical programming models and heuristic algorithms to solve the multi-model walking-worker assembly line balancing problem for the first time.","[Cevikcan, Emre] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Cevikcan, E (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.",cevikcan@itu.edu.tr,"Cevikcan, Emre/S-5115-2019","Cevikcan, Emre/0000-0001-5109-5458",,,,,63,13,13,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-5154,1758-4078,,ASSEMBLY AUTOM,Assem.

While research in this area has seen an increase in studying and developing technologies that allow and support such remote working style, not every sector is currently prepared for such a transition. Especially the manufacturing sector has faced challenges in this regard. In this paper, the mental workload of two groups of participants is studied during a human-robot interaction task. Participants were asked to bring a robotised cell used in a dispensing task to full production by tuning system parameters. After the experiment, a self-assessment of the participants' perceived mental workload using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was used.

Researchers mainly focused on assigning skilled workers to tasks for favorable capacity or cost. However, few of them have recognized the need for skill level enhancement through cross-training to avoid excessive training, especially for workload balance across multiple cells. This study presents a new mathematical programming model aimed at minimum training and maximum workload balance with economical labor utilization, to address the worker assignment problem with a cross-training plan spanning multiple cells. The model considers the trade-off between training expenditure and workload balance to achieve a more flexible solution based on decision-maker's preference. Considering the computational complexity of the problem, the classical swarm intelligence optimizers, i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC), are implemented to search the problem landscape. To improve the optimization performance, a superior tracking ABC with an augmented information sharing strategy is designed to address the problem. Ten benchmark problems are employed for numerical experiments.

Among the enabling technologies of I4.0, collaborative robots (cobots) push factory reconfiguration and prompt for worker empowerment by exploiting the respective assets of both humans and robots. Indeed, human has superior dexterity, flexibility, problem-solving ability. Robot excels in strength, endurance, accuracy and is expendable for risky activities. Therefore, task assignment problem in a production line with coexisting humans and robots cannot limit to the workload balancing among workers but should make the most of everyone respective abilities. The outcomes should not be only an increased productivity, but also improved production quality, human safety and well-being. Task assignment strategy should rely on a comprehensive assessment of the tasks from the viewpoint of suitability to humans or robots. As there are several conflicting evaluation criteria, often qualitative, the study defines the set of criteria, their metrics and proposes a method for task classification relying on Fuzzy Inference System to map each task onto a set of collaboration classes. The outcome of the study is the formal description of a set of evaluation criteria with their metrics.

This paper presents a novel visual interface that allows operators to simultaneously control a 6-DoF camera platform and a robotic manipulator whilst experiencing the remote environment through a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD). The proposed system, Orbital Head-Mounted Display (OHMD), utilizes head rotation tracking to command camera movement in azimuth and elevation directions around a fixation point located at a robot's end-effector. A human factor study was conducted to compare the interface acceptance, perceived workload, and task performance of OHMD with a conventional interface utilizing multiple fixed cameras (Array) and a standard head-mounted display implementation (HMD). Results show that both the OHMD and HMD interfaces significantly improve task performance, reduce perceived workload and increase interface acceptance compared to the Array interface. Participants reported they preferred OHMD due to the increased assistance and freedom in viewpoint selection. Whilst OHMD excelled in usefulness, the standard HMD interface allowed operators to perform robotic welding tasks significantly faster.","[Kuitert, Sjoerd; Abbink, David A.; Peternel, Luka] Delft Univ Technol, Cognit Robot, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands; [Kuitert, Sjoerd; Hofland, Jelle; Heemskerk, Cock J.

For such a problem, we present a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that linearizes and incorporates into the SALBP the Occupational Repetitive Action (OCRA). This well-known method gives ergonomic risk indicators for musculoskeletal disorders. A lexicographical approach to address the problem is proposed, where the minimum number of stations is obtained for SALBP and used as a starting point to solve a type-F ErgoSALBP (feasibility problem) focused on satisfying the maximum ergonomic risk workload. Once the exact solution is found, we establish an objective function to smooth the ergonomic risk distribution among stations. We tested a total of 2160 instances with up to 297 tasks. Our method was able to solve 94% of all instances optimally. The share of solutions found with only green stations (the ideal ergonomic condition) was 87%, surpassing the state of the art. For the instances where the model did not converge to a solution within the time limit, we present a procedure to assess the optimality gap. Furthermore, the model can be embedded as a building block for other assembly line configurations. Finally, the results provide trade-off insights for managers: the average OCRA for the line improves as the cycle time increases, which may positively impact workers' satisfaction and product quality in the long run.","[Possan Junior, Moacyr Carlos; Magatao, Leandro] Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Grad Program Elect & Comp Engn CPGEI, Curitiba, Brazil; [Michels, Adalberto Sato] Univ Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Melbourne, Australia; [Possan Junior, Moacyr Carlos] Santa Catarina State Univ UDESC, Sao Bento Do Sul, Brazil",Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana; University of Melbourne; Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina,"Magatao, L (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Grad Program Elect & Comp Engn CPGEI, Curitiba, Brazil.",moacyr.possan@udesc.br; a.satomichels@unimelb.edu.au; magatao@utfpr.edu.br,"Sato Michels, Adalberto/HHS-0776-2022; Magatao, Leandro/G-7468-2012","Sato Michels, Adalberto/0000-0003-2635-9700; Possan Junior, Moacyr Carlos/0000-0002-8040-363X; Magatao, Leandro/0000-0002-6917-9753","Santa Catarina State University (UDESC) , Brazil; CNPq, Brazil [311355/2020-0]; Australian Research Council Industrial Trans-formation Training Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies, and Applications (OPTIMA) [IC200100009]","Santa Catarina State University (UDESC) , Brazil; CNPq, Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Australian Research Council Industrial Trans-formation Training Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies, and Applications (OPTIMA)(Australian Research Council)","The first author acknowledges the support from Santa Catarina State University (UDESC) , Brazil for the Ph.D. development.

Therefore industries must develop and implement new management philosophies like lean, agile, kitting manufacturing and concurrent engineering, etc. This paper deals with a study on the impact of ergonomic based kitting assembly system on occupational safety and health of workers in an automobile industry. Kitting production is most widely used in industries that are assembly-oriented or having a high amount of repetitive human processes. Kitting assembly reduces work space requirement, operator walking distance and time, work in process inventory. For these kinds of companies, improved systems can eliminate significant levels of waste or inefficiency. So, in this paper an overall analysis was carried out to minimise the wastages and to improve the efficiency in an assembly line. Here, data collection was carried out as follows: interviews with managers and supervisors, safety specialists, safety engineer, workers, in order to know their views on both the negative and positive impacts of Kitting assembly system. Questionnaire are aimed at assessing their views on the current working conditions and also aimed at assessing their views on the differences between the conventional assembly system and the new ergonomics based kitting assembly system. The result shows that a significant increase in overall working condition of the industry which in turn led to the increase in the productivity. Also, factor analysis is carried out to group some important criteria into factors for conducting future analysis with worker to evaluate the ergonomic level of workers.

The proposed algorithm takes into consideration various important cell design issues, such as machine assignment, intercell/intracell material handling, worker assignment, outsourcing and workload balancing based on operational time and operation sequence of the parts. Workload balancing among cells tends to increase CMS processing costs, and hence the use of multiobjective optimization methods is required for CMS solutions that are optimal and feasible. A multiobjective matrix-based bacteria foraging optimization algorithm with traced constraint handling (MOMBATCH) is developed for this purpose. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II method that is frequently reported in the literature and the off-the-shelf program CPLEX. The results show that MOMBATCH solves problems more efficiently in terms of finding optimal solutions while maintaining the Pareto frontier diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Thereby, the needs and preferences of the workers shall be considered in real-time and the production process should automatically adapt to the worker. A suitable interface for human-automation interaction is needed to allow the worker to easily provide information regarding his/her physiological and psychological state. Using a smartwatch with implemented surveys for data assessment seems a promising solution. However, some studies found a significant difference when presenting the NASA-TLX on a monitor screen. The scores were higher than in the paper version. Thus, the first step should be to examine whether questionnaires presented on a smartwatch have the same outcome as presented on paper. In a laboratory experiment, 29 participants performed a constant calculating task and, afterwards, filled out the NASA-TLX via paper or via smartwatch by using the bezel or the touchscreen. The results show that the workload score in the paper version was significantly lower than the workload score in the smartwatch versions (bezel as well as touch). Nevertheless, the relative differences between the altered levels of difficulty of the arithmetic tasks could be equally well identified using the NASA-TLX scores assessed with the smartwatch version compared to the paper version. In conclusion, the assessment via smartwatch can differentiate between different levels of mental workload and therefore qualifies for the application in the field. Especially for an industrial environment, the implementation of a smartwatch carries great potential.","[Mach, Sebastian; Grundling, Jan P.; Schmalfuss, Franziska; Krems, Josef F.] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Wilhelm Raabe Str 43, D-09120 Chemnitz, Germany",Technische Universitat Chemnitz,"Mach, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, Wilhelm Raabe Str 43, D-09120 Chemnitz, Germany.",sebastian.mach@psychologie.tu-chemnitz.de,"Krems, Josef/M-7531-2017; Grundling, Jan/AAG-7335-2021","Grundling, Jan/0000-0003-0237-6792; Krems, Josef/0000-0001-6156-9944; Mach, Sebastian/0000-0003-4220-1997",,,,,14,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-3-319-96068-5; 978-3-319-96067-8,ADV INTELL SYST COMP,,,2019,825.0,,,,,,978.0,984.0,,10.1007/978-3-319-96068-5_106,0.0,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BM7LZ,,,,,2024-11-14,WOS:000468070400105,0,Industry 4.0; Smartwatch; Workload; NASA-TLX

In this context, multi-manned workstations commonly characterize these assembly lines. The simultaneous operators' activity in the same assembly station suggests considering compatibility/incompatibility between the different mounting positions, equipment sharing, and worker cooperation. The management of all these aspects significantly increases the balancing problem complexity due to the determination of the start/end times of each task. This paper proposes a new mixed-integer programming model to simultaneously optimize the line efficiency, the line length, and the workload smoothness. A customized procedure based on a simulated annealing algorithm is developed to effectively solve this problem. The aforementioned procedure is applied to the balancing of the real assembly line of European sports car manufacturers distinguished by 665 tasks and numerous synchronization constraints. The experimental results present remarkable performances obtained by the proposed procedure both in terms of solution quality and computation time. The proposed approach is the practical reference for efficient multi-manned assembly line design, task assignment, equipment allocation, and mounting position management in the considered industrial fields.","[Pilati, Francesco] Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Via Sommar 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Ferrari, Emilio; Gamberi, Mauro; Margelli, Silvia] Univ Bologna, Dept Ind Engn, Viale Risorgimento 2, I-40136 Bologna, Italy",University of Trento; University of Bologna,"Pilati, F (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Via Sommar 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",francesco.pilati@unitn.it; emilio.ferrari@unibo.it; mauro.gamberi@unibo.it; silvia.margelli@unibo.it,,"PILATI, FRANCESCO/0000-0002-6085-0985",,,,,40,12,12,0,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

It is normally assumed that each machine is typically operated by one worker at any time; therefore, shop-floor managers need to decide on the most efficient assignments for machines and workers. However, the processing time is variable and uncertain due to the fluctuating production environment caused by unsteady operating conditions of machines and learning effect of workers. Meanwhile, they also need to balance the worker workload while meeting production efficiency. Thus a dual resource-constrained FJSP with worker's learning effect and fuzzy processing time (F-DRCFJSP-WL) is investigated to simultaneously minimise makespan, total machine workloads and maximum worker workload. Subsequently, the reinforcement learning enhanced multi-objective memetic algorithm based on decomposition (RL-MOMA/D) is proposed for solving F-DRCFJSP-WL. For RL-MOMA/D, the Q-learning is incorporated into memetic algorithm to perform variable neighbourhood search and further strengthen the exploitation capability for the algorithm. Finally, comprehensive experiments on extensive test instances and a case study of aircraft overhaul shop-floor are conducted to demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","[Chang, Xiao; Jia, Xiaoliang; Ren, Jiahao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 27 West Youyi Rd, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Jia, XL (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 27 West Youyi Rd, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jiaxl@nwpu.edu.cn,"Jia, Xiaoliang/KBY-1058-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52075452]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province [2023-YBGY-381],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province,This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 52075452]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province [grant number 2023-YBGY-381].,,77,3,3,83,83,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

This study used an ad hoc system that allowed the co-registration of a set of participants' implicit and explicit (I/E) data in two experimental conditions that varied in the level of mental workload (MWL). Findings showed that the majority of the considered I/E measures were able to discriminate the different task-related mental demands and some implicit measures were capable of predicting task performance in both tasks. Moreover, self-reported measures showed that participants were aware of such differences in MWL. Finally, the paradigm's ecology highlights that task and environmental features may affect the reliability of the various I/E measures.

The role of a human operator differs from that of a pilot in a manned aircraft, and this new role creates a need for a shift in interface and task design in order to take advantage of the full potential of these systems. This study examined the effects of time pressure and target uncertainty on autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle operator task performance and workload. A 2 x 2 within subjects experiment design was conducted using Multi-Modal Immersive Intelligent Interface for Remote Operation (MIIIRO) software. The primary task was image identification, and secondary tasks consisted of responding to events encountered in typical UAS operations. Time pressure was found to produce a significant difference in subjective workload ratings as well as secondary task performance scores, while target uncertainty was found to produce a significant difference in the primary task performance scores. Interaction effects were also found for primary tasks and two of the secondary tasks. This study has contributed to the knowledge of UAS operation, and the factors which may influence performance and workload within the UAS operator. Performance and workload effects were shown to be elicited by time pressure. Relevance to industry: The research findings from this study will help the UAS community in designing human computer interface and enable appropriate business decisions for staffing and training, to improve system performance and reduce the workload.

To better implement cellular manufacturing, we investigate the integrated cell formation and worker assignment problem (ICFWAP). A comprehensive linear model is developed for the ICFWAP to determine the optimal allocation of machines, parts and workers. Specific characteristics of this model include the simultaneous consideration of production planning, coexistence of alternative process routings, lot splitting, workload balancing between cells and worker over-assignment to multiple cells. Motivated by the inefficiency of exact approaches, this paper proposes a hybrid approach combining combinatorial particle swarm optimization and linear programming (CPSO-LP) to efficiently solve real sized problems. In CPSO-LP, decision variables corresponding to part routing selection and part operation assignment are fixed and other variables are allowed to be changed. CPLEX is then used to solve the reduced LP problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed model. Results reveal that worker over-assignment can reduce the number of workers hired and improve labor utilization rate. The better efficiency and effectiveness of CPSO-LP are proved by comparisons with CPLEX, a genetic algorithm (GA), CPSO, and a hybrid approach combining GA and LP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluates the impact of HRC on construction workers' workload. Experiments involving human-robot collaborative wood assembly tasks were conducted, and workload levels of humans in different scenarios were evaluated using physiological data collected with a wearable sensing device. Thereafter, a survey was administered to participants to assess their mental workload. Findings show that HRC posed less workload on workers compared to human-human collaboration, which demonstrates the potential benefits of HRC in the aspect of workload or fatigue reduction among construction workers, and thus could help enhance productivity.","[Okonkwo, Chinedu; Liang, Xiaoyun; Rasheed, Usman; Awolusi, Ibukun; Cai, Jiannan; Wibranek, Bastian] Univ Texas San Antonio, Sch Civil & Environm Engn & Construct Management, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Awolusi, I (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Sch Civil & Environm Engn & Construct Management, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",chinedu.okonkwo@my.utsa.edu; xiaoyun.liang@my.utsa.edu; usman.rasheed@my.utsa.edu; ibukun.awolusi@utsa.edu; jiannan.cai@utsa.edu; bastian.wibranek@utsa.edu,"cai, jiannan/AAO-6272-2020; Awolusi, Ibukun/X-1147-2019",,"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [2138514, 2222670]",U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was partially funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) via Grants 2138514 and 2222670, and the authors are grateful for the support.

An adaptive binary particle swarm optimization (A-BPSO) algorithm is proposed, which is used to balance the workload of both assembly stations and processes and to minimize the human cost. Design/methodology/approach - Firstly, a cycle time model considering the cooperation of multi-skilled workers is constructed. This model provides a quantitative description of the relationship between the cycle time and multi-skilled workers by means of revising the standard learning curve with the Partition-And-Accumulate method. Then, to improve the accuracy and stability of the current heuristic algorithms, an A-BPSO algorithm that suits for the discrete optimization problems is proposed to assign multi-skilled workers to assembly stations and processes based on modified sigmoid limiting function. Findings - The proposed method has been successfully applied to a practical case, and the result justifies its advantage as well as adaptability to both theory and engineering application. Originality/value - A novel cycle time model considering cooperation of multi-skilled workers is constructed so that the calculation results of cycle time are more accurate and closer to reality. An A-BPSO algorithm is proposed to improve the stability and convergence in dealing with the problems with higher dimensional search space.

Despite focusing on main objectives such as workload imbalance and worker performance, existing disassembly line balancing studies have not addressed worker satisfaction. This study addresses the disassembly line worker assignment and balancing problem by considering not only multi-manned workstations with heterogeneous workers, but also workers' preference and performance. A novel multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is formulated with the following objectives: minimizing the number of workers, the number of workstations, workload imbalance, maximizing worker satisfaction, and worker performance. Moreover, this study is proposing heuristics to utilize game theory -oriented approaches in the context of the addressed problem. Some comparative studies were carried out to compare the performance of the proposed heuristics. The effects of the factors were revealed by the statistical analysis conducted on the solutions for newly generated test problems. After the superiority of the proposed heuristics was indicated through comparative studies, they were applied to a washing machine disassembly system in the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) industry. The application indicated the per-formance improvement for the disassembly lead time (65%) and the space requirement (64%) compared to a classical disassembly system design.","[Kose, Yildiz; Cevikcan, Emre] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Ertemel, Sinan] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Econ, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Kose, Yildiz; Murat, Mirac] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkiye",Istanbul Technical University; Istanbul Technical University; Karadeniz Technical University,"Cevikcan, E (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Ind Engn, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkiye.",kose18@itu.edu.tr; cevikcan@itu.edu.tr; ertemels@itu.edu.tr; miracmurat@ktu.edu.tr,"KOSE, YILDIZ/ABE-6784-2021; Cevikcan, Emre/S-5115-2019; murat, mirac/ABB-3351-2020; Ertemel, Sinan/ABE-8230-2020","Cevikcan, Emre/0000-0001-5109-5458; KOSE, YILDIZ/0000-0002-5758-3169; murat, mirac/0000-0001-9980-9608; Ertemel, Sinan/0000-0003-0089-4641",,,,,50,14,14,17,50,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

It is therefore important to study and understand a worker's health holistically, considering not only physical health but also mental health, work-life balance, stress, and safety. Total worker health takes factors relating to geography, industry, workload, family, travel time, etc. into consideration and thus, is a comprehensive approach to interpret worker health and well-being. This paper aims to study the total worker health of the people employed in the construction industry. An anonymous survey was conducted with worker participants from various construction trades in Seattle, the crane capital of America in 2018. Analysis of the survey results highlighted aspects that could impact total worker health in construction. One of our findings indicated that workers who put in the most physical effort had trouble sleeping at night. The physical demand and pace of work also seemed to be the contributing factors to troubled sleep. Age of the workers was found to play an important role in the commuting patterns and one's ability to maintain a work-life balance. We consider this preliminary understanding of the important aspects key to designing sensible measurements (e.g., well-being index) as well as strategic interventions to promote the well-being of construction workers and facilitate a positive work environment for the industry.","[Trivedi, Nihar; Yellapragada, Maitreyi; Lin, Ken-Yu] Univ Washington, Dept Construct Management, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Trivedi, N (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Construct Management, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nihar1904@gmail.com; ym223@uw.edu; kenyulin@uw.edu,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8287-2,,,,2020,,,,,,,336.0,345.0,,,,,,10,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BR4QC,,,,,2024-11-14,WOS:000652188000037,0,

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the collaboration between humans and robots, identifying how the operator's work is affected by HRC. A scoping review was conducted to identify the main impacts of HRC on worker's performance. Based on the results, a preliminary taxonomy of key factors influencing the performance of collaborative operators was identified. The results highlighted the importance of trust, usability, and acceptance as key requirements for the successful introduction of HRC, whereas factors as stress and workload of workers are both positively and negatively affected by HRC.

Controlled order release restricts order entry to the shop floor and is commonly employed in high-variety manufacturing where it results in benefits such as stable work-in-progress. However, it can increase waiting times when orders are blocked from release, while capacities are idling. This issue, known as premature idleness, negatively impacts delivery performance. Previous studies have primarily focused on addressing premature idleness through input control by releasing new orders to idling workstations. This approach overlooks the potential of output control during premature idleness, transferring labour to assist at other workstations in a dual resource constrained setting. Using simulation, this study demonstrates that output control significantly improves delivery performance-in terms of mean tardiness and percentage tardy-and reduces total and shop floor throughput times. Importantly, this result proves robust, even when the efficiency of the assisting worker is severely limited. Shop-level performance improves despite the efficiency loss of the worker. The impact of the where-rule is minimal, while the efficacy of the priority dispatching rule depends on the joint efficiency of collaborating workers. Finally, we show that combining input control and output control enhances performance, providing opportunities for further research on the role of both control approaches in high-variety manufacturing.","[Bergenhenegouwen, Thimo; Kasper, T.

This paper investigates humans' behaviors and perceived experiences while interacting with cognitive and physical assistance systems. To enable decisions about the combined use of more than one assistance system within a manufacturing process, comprehensive and comparable knowledge about the impact of applications on productivity and human factors is needed. A multidimensional evaluation model with a mixed-methods approach was developed and applied in a user study. In 300 run-throughs in six different scenarios with skilled workers and students, a questionnaire on human factors was completed after finishing the task. Furthermore, productivity and quality were measured during the study. A comparison between skilled workers and students demonstrated that the usability score of all assistance systems was rated higher among the students. The students rated the ergonomics aspects better for five out of six scenarios. Results show higher compatibility with values and experiences in all investigated combinations for skilled workers than for students. Considering the collected data among the skilled workers, the overall compatibility with experience and values of multi-assistance system scenarios was more positive than in the single-assistance system scenarios. Our results show no significant differences in ergonomics, mental, physical, and temporal workload between single and multi-assistance system settings. With 150 run-throughs of industrial professionals and campus recruits each, the survey joins only two studies with more than 100 participants. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first systematic multi-criteria evaluation for the combined use of several (cognitive and physical) industrial assistance systems. The results help to ease practitioners' evaluation of technical support systems in manufacturing with an emphasis on multicriteria evaluation and the consideration of interconnected (cognitive and physical) assistance systems. Furthermore, the results contribute to further research in human-machine interaction and its impact on productivity and human factors as they show potentials and prospective challenges of the implementation and application of multiple assistance systems.","[Zigart, Tanja; Zafari, Setareh; Stuerzl, Felix; Schlund, Sebastian] TU Wien, Inst Management Sci, Theresianumgasse 27, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Kiesewetter, Robert; Kasparick, Hans -Peter] Siemens AG, Werk Kombinationstech Chemnitz WKC, D-09116 Chemnitz, Germany",Technische Universitat Wien; Siemens AG; Siemens AG; Siemens Germany,"Zigart, T (corresponding author), TU Wien, Inst Management Sci, Theresianumgasse 27, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",tanja.zigart@tuwien.ac.at,"Schlund, Sebastian/JAC-8459-2023","Zafari, Setareh/0000-0003-4940-1764","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); TU Wien through the endowed professorship HCCPPAS [FFG-852789]","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); TU Wien through the endowed professorship HCCPPAS","Special thanks are directed to all the participants at Siemens WKC and in the TU Wien pilot factory for being part of the study and for their constructive cooperation.

The AR application is developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed.

A weighted mixed-integer linear mathematical programming model that aims to find optimal routing of parts in flexible manufacturing cells under constraints such as minimum machine utilization rate, maximum machine utilization rate, tool capacities, the utilization rate of workers, and labor-system unbalance is developed. The mathematical programming model aims to minimize the weighted sum of five objective functions: (1) the total number of intracellular movements; (2) the total number of intercellular movements; (3) the total workload unbalance of the machine system; (4) the total number of tools in all machines in the cells; and (5) the total labor-system workload unbalance. The main contribution of this study is to obtain these five objectives simultaneously, which have not been encountered to handle together before. By integrating these factors, the study presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing the design of flexible manufacturing cells. This study also has the potential to enhance system performance by addressing these factors.

Here we present an intelligent vision system, which allows real-time human-machine interaction in the cockpits to reduce pilot's workload. The challenges for such a vision system include extreme change in background light intensity, large field-of-view and variable working distances. Adapted hardware, use of state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms in eye gaze detection allow a smooth, and accurate real-time feedback system. The current system has been over-specified to explore the optimized solutions for different use-cases. The algorithmic pipeline for eye gaze tracking was developed and iteratively optimized to obtain the speed and accuracy required for the aviation use cases. The pipeline, which is a combination of data-driven and analytics approaches, runs in real time at 60 fps with a latency of about 32ms. The eye gaze estimation error was evaluated in terms of the point of regard distance error with respect to the 3D point location. An average error of less than 1.1cm was achieved over 28 gaze points representing the cockpit instruments placed at about 80-110cm from the participants' eyes.

Teleoperation compensates for this limitation by connecting the human operator to the robot using human-robot interfaces. The remotely operated sessions can also be used as demonstrations to program more powerful autonomous agents. In this article, we report a thorough user study to characterise the effect of simple vibrotactile feedback on the performance and cognitive load of the human user in performing teleoperated grasping and manipulation tasks. The experiments are performed using a portable and affordable bilateral teleoperation system that we designed, composed of a Leap Motion sensor and a custom-designed vibrotactile haptic glove to operate a 4-fingered robot hand equipped with 3axis force sensors on the fingertips; the software packages we developed are open-source and publicly available.

Because the worker resource in an SPS is critical for adapting to changes in demand, this study focuses on workforce-related operational strategies rarely considered for SPS. To this end, for the first time in the literature, a bi-objective workforce scheduling problem is addressed by considering the interseru worker transfer in SPS. A novel optimisation model is proposed to achieve two objectives, that of minimising makespan and reducing workload imbalance among workers. Because it is proved that the problem falls within a non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard) class, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is employed to solve large-sized problems. For small-sized problems, the second version of the augmented epsilon-constrained (AUGMECON2) method is implemented and Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained. A set of evaluation metrics is considered to compare two different operational strategies in terms of the desired objectives. The computational results indicate that allowing worker transfer leads to better results for all metrics. The main contribution of the present study is to provide a novel optimisation model for the addressed problem to compare two operational strategies by considering the heterogeneity inherent of workers.","[Yilmaz, Omer Faruk] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Trabzon, Turkey",Karadeniz Technical University,"Yilmaz, OF (corresponding author), Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Trabzon, Turkey.",omerfarukyilmaz@ktu.edu.tr,"Yilmaz, Omer Faruk/N-4085-2016","Yilmaz, Omer Faruk/0000-0002-6202-4011",,,,,57,48,52,4,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Prolonged monitoring or sustained attention has been found to be stressful for human operators. Plant and process operators have also been found to have one of the highest level of work demands (work speed, pace) in a recent European survey (Eurofound, 2015). Along with this, the incidence of Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs) remains at a high level in the manufacturing sector. This research endeavoured to determine if end-tidal CO2 levels decreased and upper trapezius muscle activity increased concurrently with increased levels of attention. We then developed a model to investigate if end-tidal CO2 moderated the relationship between mental workload due to sustained attention and upper trapezius muscle activity. The resulting interactional model found that end-tidal CO2 moderated the relationship (p = 0.004) when end-tidal CO2 reached the hypocapnic range (>35 mm Hg). This model indicates the possibility that a high level of sustained attention is a risk factor in the development of WRMSDs and should therefore be included in workplace risk assessments.

To this end, the paper proposes a novel AR tool to assist operators during the inspection activities for the detection of production and assembly errors. In fact, thanks to the superimposition of the 3D models, as designed by the technical office, a worker can easily detect the presence of design discrepancies on the final physical assembled product and report them by adding 3D annotations directly on virtual models. This AR tool has been developed by using ARCore (TM) libraries to ensure, in the first place, its compatibility with commonly used devices for which workers are already trained and, secondly, to take advantage of the hybrid-tracking techniques that combine vision- and sensor-based methods to improve the reliability of the AR visualization. Nevertheless, the proposed AR tool adopts multiple markers to minimize tracking errors and therefore to provide greater freedom of movement to the user, who can use the tool also for the assessment of large-size products. Field experimentations have been carried out on a real case study with end-users in order to assess its usability and perceived mental workload through the SUS (System Usability Scale) and NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) standard questionnaires, respectively. The usability study was performed taking into account also objective metrics, i.e., by analysing user performance in target acquisition tasks while interacting with the AR tool. Statistical analysis proved that the adoption of this AR tool requires low mental demand, and its usability has reached a high level of satisfaction both by the factory workers and engineers involved in the user study.

Drawing on interviews with unionized guest room attendants, we report on workers' perceptions of a widely-used algorithmic room assignment system. We then present worker-generated design ideas that adapt this system toward supporting three key facets of wellbeing: self-efficacy, transparency, and workload. We argue for the need to consider these facets of wellbeing through design across the service landscape, particularly as HCI attends to the impacts of AI and automation on frontline work.","[Spektor, Franchesca; Fox, Sarah E.; Awumey, Ezra; Forlizzi, Jodi] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Riordan, Christine A.] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA; [Rho, Hye Jin] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI USA; [Kulkarni, Chinmay] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA USA; [Martinez-Lopez, Marlen] Calif State Univ Stanislaus, Turlock, CA USA; [Stringam, Betsy] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM USA; [Begleiter, Ben] UNITE HERE, New York, NY USA",Carnegie Mellon University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Michigan State University; Emory University; California State University System; California State University Stanislaus; New Mexico State University,"Spektor, F (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",fspektor@andrew.cmu.edu; sarahf@andrew.cmu.edu; eawumey@andrew.cmu.edu; criord5@illinois.edu; rhohj@msu.edu; chinmay.kulkarni@emory.edu; martinezmarlen019@gmail.com; betsys@nmsu.edu; bbegleiter@unitehere.org; forlizzi@cs.cmu.edu,"Stringam, Betsy/AAK-3592-2021","Stringam, Betsy/0000-0003-2810-6854; Martinez-Lopez, Marlen/0000-0002-1022-2649; Awumey, Ezra/0000-0002-5203-6035","NSF [2128954, 2208835]; CMU's Block Center",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CMU's Block Center,"This work was partially funded by NSF 2128954, NSF 2208835, and CMU's Block Center.

Specifically, an integrated mathematical model is constructed based on a job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) considering machine layout rearrangement, transporter allocation with capacity limitation, and worker assignment with skill variance to simultaneously minimize the exit time, labor cost, worker workload difference, and trans-portation time. To tackle the concerned problem, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with a hybrid local search (INSGA-HLS) is designed. In the numerical simulation, a test dataset is first constructed according to the literature. Second, an orthogonal experiment is utilized to find the best combination of key parameters for INSGA-HLS. Third, the exploitation competence of the proposed hybrid local search (HLS) is verified. Then, the superiority of the designed INSGA-HLS algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with the other intelligent algorithms. Thereafter, the influence of three considered factors on the integrated scheduling problem is illustrated: (1) flexible machine layout rearrangement may reduce the handling time, and improve production efficiency to some extent; (2) transporter capacity limitation can prolong the transport time, which extends the exit time; and (3) worker assignment with skill variance can not only improve productivity and reduce the labor cost, but also narrow the workload difference to improve employee satisfaction. Finally, an actual production line application further verifies the practicability and benefit of the model, and the managerial significance is analyzed.","[Li, Yinghe; Chen, Xiaohui; An, Youjun; Zhao, Ziye; Jiang, Junwei] Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Mech Transmiss, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China; [Cao, Hongrui] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Chen, XH; An, YJ (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Mech Transmiss, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China.",chenxiaohui@cqu.edu.cn,"ZHAO, Zi-Ye/E-5745-2013",,"National Key Ramp;D Program of China [2020YFB1711703, 2020YFB2007-700]; Key Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [52035002]",National Key Ramp;D Program of China; Key Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the editor and anonymous re-viewers for their valuable comments and suggestions that significantly improve this paper.

In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human -centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limita-tions, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's imple-mentation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom.

Despite the trend on collaborative robots, use cases within manufacturing systems seem to be still rare. Although collaborative robots are promised to be one of the crucial innovations for ergonomically assistance for blue collar workers, the integration process into the production process and the preoccupation of workers against robot assistance alike, can be assumed as biggest challenges for companies. One of the reason might be the missing methodology and simulation tools for quick analysis of workplaces, in order to detect possible workloads for robots. The given article presents a developed learning factory seminar for students as well as industrial participants on how to integrate collaborative robots into manual assembly lines. This approach focuses on the problem based learning structure of the seminar and on the essential methods and developed concepts which are necessary to analyze workplaces, simulate robot integration with the possibility of analyzing the distributed workload between the worker and the robot. Tools as a quick check analysis for HRC and the simulation software Editor of manual work activities (ema) will be integrated during this concept.

This concept is applied in one of national plant of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) that located in North Sumatera. The problem found in the company are the working posture and excessive workload of the workers. These conditions are affects to the their job performance. The study was carried out by evaluated the worker body position using the Work Posture Assesment (WPA) and Biomechanics method. The WPA results shows the operator's working position was mostly bent more than 30 degrees. This indicates that almost all workers are felt musculoskeletal disorders during work hours. While the biomechanics analysis found the significant relation between the values of Recommended Weight Limit (RWL) and Lifting Index (LI) which the increase of RWL value will decrease the LI value. This indicated that the recommended load for a worker under certain circumstances affects the appointment made so as not to contain the risk of spinal injury. In fact these condition are due to in-efficiency in production which can be maintaned the green design of CPO plant by improving the existing work.","[Huda, L.

Spatial design is frequently represented in two-dimensional (2D) drawings of various views. These views must be combined and decoded by the end user to effectively understand all orientations of a building element and can lead to errors. Advances in three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) and 3D printing have provided promising advancements in the presentation of spatial engineering information. This research investigates cognitive-workload demands of each information format. Cognitive workload is the amount of mental resources required to complete a task from the total available mental resources. Asking subjects to complete a reconstructing task of a simple structure using 2D drawings, a 3D CAD interface, and a 3D printed model introduces the individuals to alternative forms of information presentation. After completing the task, the subjects were surveyed on their perceptions of mental workload in six main factors using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). Through a statistical analysis, there was no difference in mental workload between the three types of information presentation, indicating that the cognitive demands of the mediums are similar. However, there were statistically significant differences in workload factors due to demographic influences, such as occupation and CAD experience levels. In addition, mental workload affected the subject's productivity in task completion. The primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the investigation of mental workload as a factor in spatial understanding, and more specifically, identifying cognitive demands of individuals when presented with spatial engineering information in various formats.","[Dadi, Gabriel B.; Taylor, Timothy R.

Heat is seen as an environmental and occupational hazard with its physiological effects due to high temperature exposures. Among the heat-related effects are, dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and death. The heat-related impairments on health could also negatively impact the performance of the workers and simultaneously, decrease their productivity. While climate change the already known effects on health could become more frequent, prevalent, and spread. The present investigation provides an analysis of the level of heat stress experienced by a worker based on Wet-bulb Globe Temperature measurements. The study was conducted at a solar energy facility in Mexico. The results show that sometimes workers develop their tasks under conditions above the alert limits of exposure. Solar workers without acclimatization and heavy workload requirements (400 kcal/h) need to rest 75% from an hour and 50% when the workload is moderate (300 kcal/h). Consequently, the percentage of work capacity was established for different scenarios. The period of risk alert during a recorded heat wave, where the worker would mainly require to stop all the physical activities, started at 6:30 am and ended at 6:50 pm. In the final section, preventive measures are suggested. This research aims to contribute with information directed to environmental scientists, standard/policy developers and the solar industry that could improve/develop safety procedures directed toward the heat-related occupational health and safety within solar energy applications under the climate change conditions.","[Samaniego-Rascon, Danyela] Univ Coimbra, Fac Sci & Technol, MIT Portugal Program, Energy Sustainabil Initiat, Rua Luis Reis dos Santos,Polo 2, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Gameiro da Silva, Manuel C.; Ferreira, Almerindo D.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Mech Engn, ADAI LAETA, Rua Luis Reis Santos, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Cabanillas-Lopez, Rafael E.] Univ Sonora, Div Engn, PSH UniSon, Blvd Luis Encinas & Rosales SN, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidad de Sonora,"Samaniego-Rascón, D (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Fac Sci & Technol, MIT Portugal Program, Energy Sustainabil Initiat, Rua Luis Reis dos Santos,Polo 2, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal.",danyela.samaniego@gmail.com,"Ferreira, Almerindo/I-5518-2015; Rascon, Danyela/AAH-6587-2020; Cabanillas, Rafael/AAK-3267-2020; Gameiro da Silva, Manuel Carlos/H-8310-2012","Gameiro da Silva, Manuel Carlos/0000-0003-0739-9811; SAMANIEGO RASCON, DANYELA/0000-0003-4641-4586; Cabanillas Lopez, Rafael Enrique/0000-0003-0739-3348","LAETA (Associated Laboratory for Energy, Transports and Aeronautics) [Pest-E/EME/LA0022/201]; Mexican government foundation for Science and Technology, CONACyT (in Spanish: Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) [314149]","LAETA (Associated Laboratory for Energy, Transports and Aeronautics); Mexican government foundation for Science and Technology, CONACyT (in Spanish: Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia)","The presented work is framed under the Initiative Energy for Sustainability (EIS) Initiative of the University of Coimbra, the MIT Portugal Program and LAETA (Associated Laboratory for Energy, Transports and Aeronautics) Project Pest-E/EME/LA0022/201.

Monitoring tasks, however, can induce high levels of mental workload and thus lead to a decrease in the worker's performance and consequently to an increase in the risk of making serious errors. A promising solution to this problem is the use of assistance systems (AS). As the worker still remains responsible for an error-free operation of the automated system, the AS should be designed human-centered. Hence, it is crucial, to examine the psychological factors that influence the user's acceptance of the AS in order to ensure a successful long-term human-machine collaboration. A concept for a humancentered AS for a monitoring task is presented. Thereby, different assistance types and strategies as well as methods to determine the right point of time to apply these strategies during the task are looked at.

Worker assignment in these so-called Dual Resource Constrained (DRC) job shops is typically solved in the literature via the use of meta-heuristics, i.e. when and where rules, or heuristic assignment rules. While the former does not necessarily lead to optimal results, the latter suffers from high computational time and complexity, especially when there is a large number of workstations. This paper uses game theory to propose a new worker assignment rule for DRC job shops. The Gale-Shapley model (also known as the stable marriage problem) forms a 'couple' made up of a worker and machine following a periodic review strategy. Simulation is used to evaluate and compare the proposed model to when and where rules previously proposed in the literature.

The name NEP+ encapsulates the platform's dual mission: to empower the network-related capabilities of ZeroMQ and to provide software tools and interfaces for prototyping and integration. NEP+ accomplishes this through a comprehensive quality model and an integrated software ecosystem encompassing middleware, user-friendly graphical interfaces, a command-line tool, and an accessible end-user programming interface. This article primarily focuses on presenting the proposed quality model and software architecture, illustrating how they can empower developers to craft cross-platform, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces for various applications, with a particular emphasis on robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, we provide practical insights into the applicability of NEP+ by briefly presenting real-world user cases where human-centered projects have successfully utilized NEP+ to develop robotics systems. To further emphasize the suitability of NEP+ tools and interfaces for developer use, we conduct a pilot study that delves into usability and workload assessment. The outcomes of this study highlight the user-friendly features of NEP+ tools, along with their ease of adoption and cross-platform capabilities. The novelty of NEP+ fundamentally lies in its holistic approach, acting as a bridge across diverse user groups, fostering inclusivity, and promoting collaboration.","[Coronado, Enrique; Yamanobe, Natsuki; Venture, Gentiane] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Ind Cyber Phys Syst Res Ctr, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; [Venture, Gentiane] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); University of Tokyo,"Coronado, E (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Ind Cyber Phys Syst Res Ctr, Tokyo 1350064, Japan.",coronadozuniga.enrique@aist.go.jp; n-yamanobe@aist.go.jp; venture@cc.tuat.ac.jp,"; Yamanobe, Natsuki/M-5389-2016; Venture, Gentiane/E-7060-2013","Coronado Zuniga, Luis Enrrique/0000-0001-5444-377X; Yamanobe, Natsuki/0000-0001-8885-3064; Venture, Gentiane/0000-0001-7767-4765","Institute for Global Innovation Research, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology","Institute for Global Innovation Research, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology",No Statement Available,,68,1,1,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2023,23.0,22,,,,,,,9136,10.3390/s23229136,0.0,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,AK2X3,38005524.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-14,WOS:001118305900001,0,human-machine interaction; human-robot interaction; Industry 5.0; internet of robotic things; robotics middleware; social robotic; END-USER DEVELOPMENT; PARTICIPATORY DESIGN; USABILITY; SYSTEMS; THINGS

Five objectives are optimised simultaneously for the most complicated operational modes, i.e. machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking. Besides, the benefits of using multiline workstations (MLWs) are investigated. Design/methodology/approach The elite non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III (ENSDE III) algorithm is developed as a solution technique. Also, the largest remaining available time heuristic is proposed as a baseline in determining the number and utilisation of workers when the use of MLWs is not allowed. Findings ENSDE III outperforms the cutting-edged multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, i.e. multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III, under two key Pareto metrics, i.e. generational distance and inverted generational distance, regardless of the problem size. The best-found number of workers from ENSDE III is substantially lower than the upper bound. The MULS with MLWs requires fewer workers than the one without. Research limitations/implications Although this research has extended several issues in the basic model of multiple U-line systems, some assumptions were used to facilitate mathematical computation as follows. The U-line system in this research assumed that all lines were produced only a single product. Besides, all workers were well-trained to gain the same skill. These assumptions could be extended in the future. Practical implications The implication of this research is the benefits of multiline workstations (MLWs) used in the multiple U-line system. Instead of leaving each individual line to operate independently, all lines should be working in parallel through the use of MLWs to gain benefits in terms of worker reduction, balancing worker's workload, higher system utilisation. Originality/value This research is the first to address the WAP in the MULS with machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking modes. Worker's fatigue due to standing and walking while working is incorporated into the model. The novel ENSDE III algorithm is developed to optimise the multi-objective WAP in a Pareto sense. The benefits of exploiting MLWs are also illustrated.","[Chutima, Parames; Chimrakhang, Jurairat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Bangkok, Thailand; [Chutima, Parames] Acad Sci, Off Royal Soc Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Chutima, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Bangkok, Thailand.;Chutima, P (corresponding author), Acad Sci, Off Royal Soc Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand.",cparames@chula.ac.th,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-5154,1758-4078,,ASSEMBLY AUTOM,Assem.

Here, we present a virtual collaborative platform in which the human operator and a simulated robot coordinate their actions to accomplish a simple assembly task. In this study,.the robot moved slowly or more quickly in order to assess the effect of its velocity on the human's responses. Ten participants tested this application by using an Oculus Rift head-mounted display; ARTracking cameras and a Kinect system were used to track the operator's right arm movements and hand gestures respectively. Performance, user experience, andphysiological responses were recorded. The results showed that while humans' performances and evaluations varied as a function of the robot's velocity, no differences were found in the physiological responses. Taken together, these data highlight the relevance of the kinematic aspects of robot's motion within a human-robot collaboration and provide valuable insights to further develop our virtual human -machine interactive platform.","[Etzi, Roberta; Scurati, Giulia Wally; Ferrise, Francesco; Carulli, Marina; Bordegoni, Monica] Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, Milan, Italy; [Huang, Siyuan] Politecn Milan, Dept Design, Milan, Italy; [Lyu, Shilei] Politecn Milan, Sch Ind & Informat Engn, Milan, Italy; [Gallace, Alberto] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Psychol & MibTec, Milan, Italy; [Gaggioli, Andrea; Chirico, Alice] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Psychol, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Milano-Bicocca; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Etzi, R (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Mech Engn, Milan, Italy.",roberta.etzi@polimi.it,"Gallace, Alberto/L-7276-2015; Gaggioli, Andrea/B-4643-2013; Etzi, Roberta/AAK-7368-2020; Huang, Siyuan/AAQ-6784-2020; Ferrise, Francesco/C-6502-2008; Huang, Siyuan/IAR-9556-2023","Ferrise, Francesco/0000-0001-8951-8807; Huang, Siyuan/0000-0002-2280-9770",,,,,15,11,11,1,15,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-5917-9,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,UNSP V001T02A080,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BO5RL,,,,,2024-11-14,WOS:000518726700080,0,Human-robot collaboration; Virtual Reality; Workload; Stress

Optimizing machine and worker assignments to achieve maximum efficiency is a critical problem for workshop managers. This paper investigates a multi-objective dual-resource-constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem. An improved wild horse optimization (IWHO) algorithm is developed to simultaneously optimize three objectives: makespan, maximum machine workload, and total machine workload. To evaluate the quality of individuals in multi-objective optimization, the Pareto fast non-dominated sorting method is used, and the crowding distance is calculated. To update the algorithm's solution, the crossover and mutation operations are used. Further, a local neighborhood search strategy is employed to enhance searchability and avoid trapping into the local optima. The benchmark of the flexible job shop scheduling problem is extended to create test instances, and the performance of the suggested IWHO algorithm is evaluated compared with the NSGA-II. The computational results show that the IWHO algorithm provides a non-dominated efficient set within a reasonable running time. Furthermore, a buffers and chain coupler assembly process is designed to analyze the practical value of the IWHO algorithm. The proposed solutions can be used to generate daily schedules for managing machines, workers, and production cycles.","[Peng, F.; Zheng, L.] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Peng, F.] CRRC Acad Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Zheng, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lzheng@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,37,1,1,14,25,"UNIV MARIBOR, FAC MECHANICAL ENGINEERING",MARIBOR,"SMETANOVA ULICA 17, MARIBOR, SI-2000, SLOVENIA",1854-6250,1855-6531,,ADV PROD ENG MANAG,Adv.

The PC slabs are manufactured at the factory and then arranged in stacks for transport to the construction site for assembly. Currently, optimization of the stacking plans for PC slabs focuses on yard-space utilization and transportation efficiency and rarely considers the assembly sequence; secondary sequencing of prefabricated elements is required during construction to meet the lifting scheme, which leads to increased construction preparation time and risk of worker injury. To enable stacking crews to generate stacking plans rapidly and systematically to improve the on-site lifting efficiency of the components, this paper proposes a storage-location allocation model with two objectives: reduce secondary-sorting workload and increase stacking stability for PC slabs. At the same time, it must match the characteristics of the problem. To prevent the solution from falling into the local optimum during the evolution of the particle swarm optimization algorithm, we introduce an elitist learning strategy, which can improve the solutions when the group converges. Finally, we verify our allocation model and optimization algorithm through example simulations. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional method, the stacking plans generated by this method have a lower secondary-sorting workload and higher stacking stability when using the same number of storage racks.","[Zou, Yiquan; Gao, Qin; Wang, Shuqiang] Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Technology,"Gao, Q (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",102000725@hbut.edu.cn,"Wang, Shuqiang/AEB-1476-2022",,[2020ZLSH08],,This research was funded by the Technology Boosts Economy 2020 Industrial Application of BIM-based Prefabricated Building Integrated Design Technology under grant number 2020ZLSH08.,,35,2,2,6,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,OCT,2022,12.0,10,,,,,,,1538,10.3390/buildings12101538,0.0,,,18,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,5R3YW,,gold,,,2024-11-14,WOS:000874450200001,0,precast concrete slab; stacking plans; particle swarm optimization; elitist learning strategy; secondary-sorting workload; stacking stability; CONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHM

The study employed semi-structured interview with 10 experienced practitioners on past lean projects to establish potential linkage between ergonomics and Lean's 3 M. A conceptual framework integrating ergonomics components into the Lean's 3 M components was then generated through group discussion, and validated using Fuzzy Delphi Method analysis. The interviews revealed four themes linking ergonomics to Lean's 3 M: (1) Human energy waste, (2) Uneven workload distribution, (3) Overburden of worker's capacity, and (4) Worker performance affects work performance. A conceptual framework integrating ergonomics components into the Lean's 3 M components was then proposed, which redefines several components of Lean's 3 M from ergonomics perspective. Fuzzy Delphi Method analysis on 12 practitioners showed overall agreement with the content, structure, and applicability of the proposed framework (threshold (d) value <= 0.2, expert consensus >= 75%, and fuzzy score >= 0.5).

The presence of multiple optimization objectives and coupled subproblems results in a considerably large search space, which poses challenges that existing optimization frameworks cannot effectively address. Thus, we propose a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive decomposition algorithm (RLADA) to address this issue. First, to minimize the search space, the HSSWT is decomposed into two subproblems, each utilizing distinct search strategies to explore specific areas. Elite-driven population evolution and a lower bound-guided greedy search are proposed to solve the individual subproblems. Second, a deep Q-network has been developed to adaptively select the subproblem to optimize in each generation by dynamically dividing the objective space. Finally, to narrow the search space, the lower bound is used to filter out unpromising solutions, thereby avoiding invalid searches. Additionally, the lower bound is utilized to determine the search depth according to the optimization margin, helping to conserve computing resources. Extensive comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the specialized designs, and the RLADA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution convergence and diversity when addressing the HSSWT.","[Wu, Yuting; Wang, Ling; Li, Rui; Chen, Jing-fang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ling] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Intelligent Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Wang, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",wyt20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; wangling@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; li-r23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; cjf17@tsinghua.org.cn,"Wu, Yuting/CAH-1016-2022; Li, Rui/GPT-3842-2022","Wang, Ling/0000-0003-1226-2801; Rui, Li/0000-0001-5335-9453",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2023YFB3308002]; Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China [62273193]; State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology [IMETKF2024005],National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology,"Acknowledgments This research is supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2023YFB3308002, the Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62273193, and the State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology (IMETKF2024005) .",,52,0,0,15,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6502,2210-6510,,SWARM EVOL COMPUT,Swarm Evol.

This platform makes it possible for an expert to assist a worker for industrial assembly task in different places. Our goal is to compare the effect of sharing head pointer in a SAR remote collaboration with AR annotations in manufacturing. First, we develop an AR remote collaborative platform. This platform implements sharing a remote expert's head pointer instead of eye gaze. Then, we evaluate the prototype system comparing two conditions through a user study, AR annotations and gaze cues (GC), relating to their effectiveness in the assembly efficiency, numbers of incorrect operation, workload, and collaborative experience. The results show that sharing head pointer can improve performance, co-presence awareness, and user collaborative experiences and decreases the numbers of incorrect operations. More importantly, we implement GC visualization in low-cost head tracking and find that it acts as a good referential pointing. Therefore, head pointer could be a competent representation of GC in AR/MR remote collaboration for assembly assistance.

Such a focus is pivotal to optimize input precision and efficiency, thus contributing to research on the virtual interaction interfaces of these robotic arms. During empirical evaluations, metrics related to human-machine interaction, such as objective operational efficiency, precision, and subjective workload, were meticulously quantified. Moreover, the influence of disparate guidance methods on the interaction experience of digital twin robotic arms and their corresponding scenarios was investigated.

This research proposes a theoretical method to analyze the postures tracked by videos with biomechanical models. Through the biomechanical skeleton representation of human body, the workload and joint torques are rapidly and accurately evaluated based on the rotation angles of joints.

It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eyetracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages.","[Zhu, Qi; Shi, Yangming] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 454A Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Du, Jing] Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wei, Paul] Univ Florida, Dept Comp & Informat Sci & Engn, 432 Newell Dr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Du, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Engn Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, 1949 Stadium Rd 460F Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",qizhu@ufl.edu; eric.du@essie.ufl.edu; shiyangming@ufl.edu; pwei1@ufl.edu,"Du, Jing/AHE-6199-2022; Zhu, Qi/KYR-6238-2024; Shi, Yangming/AAT-8768-2021",,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [1937053, 2024784]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [2024784] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities [1937053] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA))","This material is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants 1937053 and 2024784.

As assembly tasks become increasingly complex and change rapidly, the cognitive load on employees increases. This leads to the use of assistance systems for manual assembly to detect and avoid human errors and thus ensure consistent product quality. Most of these systems promise to improve the production environment but have hardly been studied quantitatively so far. Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision have also not yet been fully exploited. This study aims to provide architectural, and implementational details of a state-of-the-art assembly assistance system based on an object detection model. The proposed architecture is intended to be representative of modern assistance systems. The error prevention potential is determined in a case study in which test subjects manually assemble a complex explosion-proof tubular lamp. The results show 51 % fewer assembly errors compared to a control group without assistance. Three of the four considered types of error classes have been reduced by at least 42 %. In particular, errors by omission are most likely to be prevented by the system. The reduction in the error rate is observed over the entire period of 30 consecutive product assemblies, comparing assisted and unassisted assembly. Furthermore, the recorded assembly data are found to be valuable regarding traceability and production improvement processes.","[Riedel, A.; Gerlach, J.; Dietsch, M.; Herbst, S.; Engelmann, F.; Brehm, N.; Pfeifroth, T.] Ernst Abbe Univ Appl Sci, Dept Ind Engn, Jena, Germany",,"Riedel, A (corresponding author), Ernst Abbe Univ Appl Sci, Dept Ind Engn, Jena, Germany.",alexander.riedel@eah-jena.de,,"Riedel, Alexander/0000-0002-1466-3206",Carl-Zeiss-Foundation,Carl-Zeiss-Foundation,The authors would like to thank the Carl-Zeiss-Foundation for their support within the research project Smart Assembly.

This article examines the use of priming as a form of cognitive hacking to adversely affect quality inspection decisions in manufacturing, and investigates physiological measurements as means to detect such intrusion. In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection.","[Huang, Wenyan; Chen, Xiaoyu; Jin, Ran; Lau, Nathan] Virginia Tech, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lau, N (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Grado Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",nathan.lau@vt.edu,"Lau, Nathan/T-1767-2019; Chen, Xiaoyu/AGX-8179-2022","Lau, Nathan/0000-0003-2235-9527; Huang, Wenyan/0000-0003-2914-1416","NSF [1839946]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1839946] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","We thank Mi Zhou, Tianzi Wang and Qing Lan for their support in the development of the logging system and preparation of the experiment.

Human factors refer to physical, cognitive, and psychological states that can impact the efficiency, effectiveness, and mental health of workers. The article identifies six human factors that are particularly crucial in today's workplaces: physical fatigue, attention, mental workload, stress, trust, and emotional state. Each of these factors alters the human physiological response in a unique way, affecting the human brain, cardiovascular, electrodermal, muscular, respiratory, and ocular reactions. This paper provides an overview of these human factors and their specific influence on psycho-physiological responses, along with suitable technologies to measure them in working environments and the currently available commercial solutions to do so. By understanding the importance of these human factors, employers can make informed decisions to create a better work environment that leads to improved worker well-being and productivity.","[Loizaga, Erlantz; Bastida, Leire] TECNALIA, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Derio Bizkaia 48160, Spain; [Eyam, Aitor Toichoa] Tampere Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, FAST Lab, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Loizaga, E (corresponding author), TECNALIA, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Derio Bizkaia 48160, Spain.",erlantz.loizaga@tecnalia.com,"Martinez Lastra, Jose Luis/G-4273-2014","Martinez Lastra, Jose Luis/0000-0001-6227-3408; Toichoa Eyam, Aitor/0000-0001-7110-6679; Loizaga, Erlantz/0000-0001-6481-7536; Bastida, Dr. Leire/0000-0002-2399-2757",European Union [873087]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [873087] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership),This work was supported by the European Union through the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (SHOP4CF) under Grant 873087.,,274,7,7,7,26,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11.0,,,,,,53806.0,53829.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3280071,0.0,,,24,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,I9ZV8,,gold,,,2024-11-14,WOS:001006300300001,0,Human factors; Fifth Industrial Revolution; Fatigue; Psychology; Employment; Nervous system; Biochemistry; industry 5.0; psycho-physiological signals; human physical and cognitive states; signal acquisition; measuring techniques; human-in-the-loop; industrial applications; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; MENTAL WORKLOAD; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; INTERPERSONAL-TRUST; DECISION-MAKING; BLOOD-PRESSURE; EYE ACTIVITY; STRESS; FATIGUE; EEG

These interviews indicated that effective mitigation methods and techniques originate from both the organization and the worker. Current industry practices and potential recommendations to manage worker fatigue in the oil and gas operations are provided. These practices and recommendations include improving sleep quality through effective sleep-cabin arrangements, reducing physical and cognitive workload through improved work/tool/environment designs, and facilitating periodic fatigue monitoring. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: Offshore drilling in the oil and gas industry presents a fast-paced, hazardous work environment that can evoke states of fatigue or tiredness. Purpose: To gain insight into the day-to-day experience and mitigation of fatigue among workers in this industry. Methods: Interviews were conducted with eleven offshore personnel working on an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Qualitative data analysis of interview transcripts provided an initial code set for categorizing the data. Results: The coding process, enhanced using visualizations, revealed some themes that highlighted dimensions of fatigue, such as physical and cognitive aspects, in addition to the more commonly recognized source of fatigue, namely shiftwork. These themes also emphasized potential fatigue mitigation strategies that were either organizationally or individually driven. Such strategies include needs for improved coordination around shift work schedules and sleeping arrangements, and a widespread perceived obligation to work past fatigue, despite being encouraged to report symptoms. Conclusions: These results provided a better understanding of worker perceptions of fatigue sources, reporting challenges, and adoption of personal mitigation strategies among oil and gas workers. These results can also inform specific organizational opportunities for mitigating fatigue in offshore drilling operations. Potential strategies that encourage periodic fatigue monitoring, improve sleep quality, and reduce work-related physical and cognitive overload should be examined for effective adoption in this industry.","[Mehta, Ranjana K.; Smith, Alec; Williams, Jason P.; Sasangohar, Farzan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Peres, S.

The amount of electric current used in the sewing work was measured, and the measured data was transmitted to a server using Wi-Fi communication. The analysis of the data was conducted through the Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods. The daily workload of each worker derived from the system developed through this study showed an error rate of 8% compared to the actual workload, and the time measured by the sensor was different from the time measured by a manager using a stopwatch. These differences are considered to be due to measurement errors in the stopwatch, human noise from the measurer and the operator, and the relatively few samples relative to the total workload. The IoT-based power monitoring and work measurement system for sewing work developed through this study can be applied to smart garment manufacturing factories at an acceptable cost level, while SMEs can realise high recognition rates and semi-real-time monitoring.","[Jung, Woo-Kyun; Kim, Hyungjung; Ahn, Sung-Hoon] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Young-Chul; Lee, Jae-Won] Hojeon Ltd, Seoul, South Korea; [Ahn, Sung-Hoon] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Adv Machines & Design, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Ahn, SH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Seoul, South Korea.;Ahn, SH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Adv Machines & Design, Seoul, South Korea.",ahnsh@snu.ac.kr,"Kim, Hyungjung/AAA-9375-2020; Ahn, Sung-Hoon/GLS-7239-2022; lee, jaewon/JEO-9073-2023","Ahn, Sung-Hoon/0000-0002-1548-2394",SNU-Hojeon Garment Smart Factory Research Centre - Hojeon Ltd.

However, as the safety-critical aspect of task increases, more difficult and expensive it is to develop and test AI-based solutions. Such is the case in aviation and therefore, development must happen over longer periods of time and in a step-by-step manner. This paper focuses on creating an interface between the human pilot and a potential assistant system that helps the pilot navigate through a complex flight scenario.

Several hazards exist when workers are within the robots' working envelope, including high mental stress induced by the robot as well as the risk of physical collision. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes a cyber-physical system (CPS) for safe, worker-centered human-robot collaboration (HRC). The physical components of the CPS include a wearable biosensor for assessing workers' mental conditions and a video camera for evaluating the risk of collision accidents. The cyber component incorporates a machine learning layer that employs a kernelized logistic regression to translate worker bio-signals into distinct physiological states. Simultaneously, the system monitors the relative distance between workers and robots by applying computer vision techniques (i.e., video frame differencing, dilation, and contour detection). To test the feasibility of the proposed CPS, six subjects were asked to perform a series of bricklaying tasks jointly with a vehicle robot with different risks of collision (various distances from the robot) and at different levels of cognitive load (various tasks' complexity). The findings revealed that the proposed CPS allows the co-bot to adjust its speed relative to the subject's physiological states with 93.70% accuracy. In addition, the proposed system shows promising performance in collision avoidance with the accurate monitoring of position between robots and humans. The results unfold the feasibility of the proposed CPS in enhancing safe and intelligent HRC in construction under the trend of Industry 4.0.","[Liu, Yizhi; Habibnezhad, Mahmoud; Jebelli, Houtan] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, State Coll, PA 16801 USA; [Monga, Vishal] Penn State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Coll, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Liu, YZ (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.",ykl5505@psu.edu; mahmoud@psu.edu; hjebelli@psu.edu; vum4@psu.edu,,,,,,,18,5,5,3,7,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8389-3,,,,2022,,,,,,,1075.0,1083.0,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BU8LH,,,,,2024-11-14,WOS:000948933100132,0,

Maintenance activities in aeronautics consist of complex tasks carried out on various high-technology products under severe constraints from the sector and work environment. AR tools appear to be a potential solution to improve interactions between workers and technical data to increase the productivity and the quality of aeronautical maintenance activities. However, assessments of the actual impact of AR on industrial processes are limited due to a lack of methods and tools to assist in the integration and evaluation of AR tools in the field. This paper presents a method for deploying AR tools adapted to maintenance workers and for selecting relevant evaluation criteria of the impact in an industrial context. This method is applied to design an AR tool for the maintenance workshop, to experiment on real use cases, and to observe the impact of AR on productivity and user satisfaction for all worker profiles. Further work aims to generalize the results to the whole maintenance process in the aeronautical industry. The use of the collected data should enable the prediction of the impact of AR for related maintenance activities.","[Loizeau, Quentin; Danglade, Florence; Ababsa, Fakhreddine; Merienne, Frederic] HESAM Univ, Inst Technol, Arts & Metiers, LISPEN, Paris, France",Universite de Montpellier; heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM),"Loizeau, Q (corresponding author), HESAM Univ, Inst Technol, Arts & Metiers, LISPEN, Paris, France.",quentin.loizeau.pro@gmail.com,,"Danglade, Florence/0000-0002-8281-1004",,,,,38,4,4,1,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2673-4192,,FRONT VIRTUAL REAL,Front.

However, they also need to balance the workload among workers while meeting deadlines. In this research, the dual resource-constraint flexible job-shop scheduling problem with sequencing flexibility (DR-FJSPS) is formulated. The DR-FJSPS deals with decisions made regarding machines, worker assignments, and sequencing flexibility simultaneously in a flexible job-shop environment. Sequencing flexibility is studied in this paper, and precedence relationships of the operations are defined by a directed acyclic graph instead of the traditional linear order. The DR-FJSPS is modelled as a multi-objective problem to minimize conflicting objectives as makespan, maximal worker workload, and weighted tardiness. Due to the intractability of the DR-FJSPS, an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with an innovative operator is developed to solve this problem efficiently. The algorithm provides a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that decision-makers can use to evaluate trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Tailor-made instances are introduced to demonstrate the applicability of the model and algorithm. A multi-random-start local search algorithm is developed to assess the effectiveness of the adapted NSGA-II. In addition to that, the multi-objective model is solved using the weighted sum approach. A comparison of the solutions demonstrates that the modified NSGA-II provides a non-dominated efficient set in a reasonable length of time. The benefits of the proposed solution methods, such as defining their everyday schedules, adapting schedules according to management needs, prioritization of makespan, on-time deliveries, and workers' workload simultaneously, are highlighted.","[Vital-Soto, Alejandro] Cape Breton Univ, Shannon Sch Business, 1250 Grand Lake Rd, Sydney, NS B1P 6L2, Canada; [Baki, Mohammed Fazle] Univ Windsor, Odette Sch Business, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Azab, Ahmed] Univ Windsor, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Automot & Mat Engn, Prod & Operat Management Res Lab, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",Cape Breton University; University of Windsor; University of Windsor,"Vital-Soto, A (corresponding author), Cape Breton Univ, Shannon Sch Business, 1250 Grand Lake Rd, Sydney, NS B1P 6L2, Canada.",alejandro_vital@cbu.ca; fbaki@uwindsor.ca; azab@uwindsor.ca,,"Azab, Ahmed/0000-0002-1520-9566; Vital-Soto, Alejandro/0000-0003-2091-5024",,,,,54,19,20,7,94,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1936-6582,1936-6590,,FLEX SERV MANUF J,Flex.

Nevertheless, most of the existing AR-aided assembly processes are carried out by triggering the step-by-step visual instruction manually, lacking scene-aware generation for the assembly assistance accordingly. To facilitate an intelligent AR-aided assembly, this paper proposed an edge computing (EC)-driven Scene-aware Intelligent AR Assembly (EC-SIARA) system, which can understand the assembly status on the fly with the lightweight wearable AR glass, and thus, worker-centered assistance is available to provide intuitive visual guidance accordingly. In beginning, the connection between the wearable AR glasses and EC system is established, which can alleviate the computing burden for the resource-constraint wearable AR glasses, and a high-efficiency scene awareness module during the manual assembly process is achieved. And then, based on context understanding of the current assembly status, the intuitive instructions can be triggered automatically, avoiding the operator's cognitive load to launch the next AR instruction strictly. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed EC-SIARA system, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can realize a worker-center AR assembly process, improve the assembly efficiency, and reduce the occurrence of assembly errors effectively.","[Fu, Mingyu; Fang, Wei; Gao, Shan; Hong, Jianhao; Chen, Yizhou] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Modern Post, Sch Automat, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Fang, W (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Modern Post, Sch Automat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fangwei@bupt.edu.cn,"fu, mingyu/KHW-8636-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52105505]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [3204050]; Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology [VRLAB2020B05],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology,"This work is partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52105505), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (3204050), the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems (VRLAB2020B05).",,41,10,11,7,65,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

The subjective evaluation on a visual display terminal (VDT) interface is usually influenced by the subject's emotional or mental factors, which will lead to the inaccurate results. In this paper, an objective description model was established by least square method on the basis of the combination of subjective and objective experiments. The test objects were the instrument interfaces with different color combinations. The amplitude and latency of P100 and P300 induced by different combinations were obtained, as well as the occupancy of electroencephalogram (EEG) power under different bands. Besides, a subjective evaluation was performed. Through correlation analysis, the highly relevant relationships were found among the visual comfort (VC) and P300 amplitude at the parietal lobe (P4) F-P4 (r = 0.644, p < 0.05), the occupancy of beta band power P-beta (r = 0.85, p < 0.005), and the rate of beta/(alpha + theta) P(alpha+theta)/beta (r = -0.872, p < 0.005). Through the least square surface fitting, a mathematical model of visual comfort (VC) was established and F-P4 and P-beta are independent variables. The model reveals that the relationship between VC and FP4 is positive linear and the relationship between VC and P-beta is quadratic parabola; a negative relation is found between VC and the interaction of F-P4 and P-beta. The above results illustrated that it is feasible to use this model to evaluate the visual comfort objectively. It can provide support for all kinds of personalized customization of the user interface in the whole life cycle of cloud manufacturing.","[Jiang, Ying; Hong, Jun] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei; Qu, Jue] Air Force Engn Univ, Missile Inst, Xian 710051, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Air Force Engineering University,"Hong, J (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.",jhong@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,Aeronautical Science Foundation of China [20131996014],Aeronautical Science Foundation of China,This paper is supported by the Aeronautical Science Foundation of China (Number: 20131996014).,,45,4,4,0,26,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

The demand placed on textile manufacturers to rapidly produce products that adhere to a set of standard quality assurance requirements has increased dramatically, leading to increased burden on quality assurance floors and national testing labs. Standardized testing of protective equipment is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that requires human operators to perform tasks that can be automated using various technologies, such as collaborative robots and computer vision systems. The tests we focus on involve evaluating surgical masks and protective materials for blood penetration resistance, flammability, and liquid barrier performance. This work introduces a test cell designed to accommodate human operators in completing various quality assurance tests for protective equipment. The test cell is comprised of custom-designed cases containing test specimens to facilitate robot manipulation and cameras to monitor and characterize the test results. We demonstrate how the system can reduce the workload and reliance on human operators at no expense to the quality assurance process. Based on validation test results and user experience, it is predicted that the human operator will only have to prepare cases with test specimens and handle infrequent failures that occur within the system, without compromising overall completion time. We envision that this system will relieve the strain on textile manufacturing processes requiring human labor to repeatedly perform simple tasks.","[Shaham, Michael H.; Skopin, Matthew; Hochsztein, Hillel; Mabulu, Katiso; Milburn, Lee; Tukpah, James; Tunik, Aleksandr; Winn, James; Zolotas, Mark; Erdogmus, Deniz; Padir, Taskin] Northeastern Univ, Inst Experiential Robot, Boston, MA USA",Northeastern University,"Shaham, MH (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Inst Experiential Robot, Boston, MA USA.",shaham.m@northeastern.edu; skopin.m@northeastern.edu; h.hochsztein@northeastern.edu; mabulu.k@northeastern.edu; milburn.l@northeastern.edu; tukpah.j@northeastern.edu; tunik.a@northeastern.edu; winn.j@northeastern.edu; m.zolotas@northeastern.edu; d.erdogmus@northeastern.edu; t.padir@northeastern.edu,"Padir, Taskin/JCE-6459-2023; Zolotas, Mark/Y-5893-2019","Zolotas, Mark/0000-0002-7672-940X; Milburn, Lee/0000-0001-6953-9459","Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing (ARM) Institute - Office of the Secretary of Defense [ARM-TEC-20-02-F-01, W911NF-17-3-0004]",Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing (ARM) Institute - Office of the Secretary of Defense,This work was supported in part by Subaward No. ARM-TEC-20-02-F-01 from the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing (ARM) Institute under Agreement Number W911NF-17-3-0004 sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.,,21,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-9404-5,,,,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/HST56032.2022.10025429,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BV5OA,,,,,2024-11-14,WOS:001050968600011,0,Image classification; manufacturing automation; robot vision systems; robots; quality assurance

Considering the dual flexibility of machine and worker, this paper studies the multi-objective hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with dual resource constraints (DHFSP). Firstly, according to the characteristics of DHFSP and various constraints, the model is built to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan), total tardiness time and workload balance of worker. Then, an improved multi-objective memetic algorithm (IMOMA) is proposed to solve the DHFSP, which mainly includes the improvement of initial population, crossover, mutation and local search. In addition, Taguchi method is used to set parameters. Finally, through numerical experiments, IMOMA is compared with NSGA-II, MODE and MOMVO algorithms. The experimental results show that IMOMA can solve the multi-objective hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with dual resource constraints effectively. In terms of convergence, diversity and dominance of non-dominated solutions, IMOMA is significantly superior to other algorithms, but the distribution uniformity of non-dominated solutions of the four algorithms are not significantly different.","[Geng, Kaifeng; Ye, Chunming] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Geng, Kaifeng; Liu, Li] Nanyang Inst Technol, Informat Construct & Management Ctr, Nanyang 473004, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; Nanyang Institute of Technology,"Ye, CM (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.",yechm@usst.edu.cn,,"Geng, Kaifeng/0000-0001-5524-4713; Ye, Chunming/0000-0002-4090-5213",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71840003]; Science and Technology Development Program of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology [2018KJFZ043]; Henan Province Science and Technology Research Project [182102210113],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Development Program of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology; Henan Province Science and Technology Research Project,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71840003, in part by the Science and Technology Development Program of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology under Grant 2018KJFZ043, and in part by the Henan Province Science and Technology Research Project under Grant 182102210113.",,43,8,9,10,73,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8.0,,,,,,104527.0,104542.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2999680,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LZ2FN,,gold,,,2024-11-14,WOS:000541044200001,0,Hybrid flow shop scheduling; dual resource constraints; multi-objective optimization; memetic algorithm; Taguchi method; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION; SETUP; TIME; 2-STAGE

However, many novel warehousing systems require human-machine interactions, leading to a growing scientific and managerial necessity to consider human factors and behavior, particularly for operational activities. This is the first study that comprehensively identifies and analyzes relevant behavioral issues of interactions between warehouse operators and machines. To do so, we develop a systematic framework that links human-machine interactions with behavioral issues and implications on system performance across all operational warehouse activities. Insights generated by interviews with warehousing experts are applied to identify the most important issues. We develop a comprehensive research agenda, consisting of a set of potential research questions associated to the identified behavioral issues. The discussion is enriched by providing theoretical and managerial insights from related domains and existing warehousing research.

The varying demand patterns and life-cycles associated with each product class require different planning decisions possibly with different objectives; cost-efficiency for basic products and time-responsiveness for fashion products. Although it may appear that such products may be handled separately from inventory and transportation perspectives, they certainly are inseparable at the warehouse as they often get handled simultaneously by the same warehouse resources (i.e., workers and technology). To address this challenge, we introduce a novel problem to the literature, the two-product class, multi-product quantities, multi-echelon, multi-period, distribution planning problem. The uniqueness of this problem is in jointly deriving optimal distribution plans for both product classes, combined with optimal warehouse design decisions (e.g., technology and workforce), in order to minimize the total cost. We model this problem as a mixed-integer bilinear optimization problem, which turns out to be computationally challenging when dealing with industry-size instances (e.g., 200 stores, 1000 products, and 28 time-periods). We, therefore, propose a heuristic based on the iterative local search framework and conduct a comprehensive experimental study. Results suggest that with an increase in the proportion of fashion products, there is a substantial increase in warehouse workload variation, and subsequently total cost. An increase in fashion window tends to mitigate the variation and so do situations where the warehouse is located in regions with higher worker costs.","[Sainathuni, Bhanuteja; Guthrie, Bradley; Parikh, Pratik J.] Wright State Univ, Dept Biomed Ind & Human Factors Engn, 207 Russ Engn Ctr,3640 Colonel Glenn Hwy, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Kong, Nan] Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Parikh, PJ (corresponding author), Wright State Univ, Dept Biomed Ind & Human Factors Engn, 207 Russ Engn Ctr,3640 Colonel Glenn Hwy, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",pratik.parikh@wright.edu,"Parikh, Pratik/AAV-8628-2020",,"National Science Foundation [1235061, 1235283]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1235061, 1235283] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This research was partially supported by National Science Foundation Grants CMMI #1235061 and #1235283.

Furthermore, the manual monitoring processes traditionally employed are both time-consuming and costly.

Thus, there is a necessity to integrate technological advancements that ensure real-time worker safety monitoring and alleviate the workload of on-site safety managers who oversee worker activities. The iSAFEGuard platform has been introduced to address this issue, incorporating cutting-edge technological monitoring innovations employing 127 unsafe scene detectors through Computer Vision (CV) technology. This platform has been developed to monitor and mitigate various risks, including falls, being caught in/between incidents, being struck by objects, electric shock occurrences, fires, etc. The advancement and application of techniques such as depth estimation, edge detection, and background subtraction in identifying these risks are discussed. Additionally, diverse applications of the iSAFEGuard platform on activities involving scaffolds, ladders, welding machinery, arrow saws, and others are explored.

This article describes the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) in terms of upgraded workplace understanding, training, and assisting semi-skilled/new workers in an industrial production environment. The different modes of instruction visualization techniques are investigated for the execution of assembly tasks and explored their impact in accordance to the efficiency of task execution, completion time, error rate perception, cognitive load, and independence. Progress outcomes of 24 participants are explored for real-time execution of a Reverse osmosis (RO) booster pump assembly in terms of different modes of visualization, such as the conventional document method, virtual /desktop mode, and object mappingbased AR. Additionally, the user studies on different visualization devices involving hand-held visualization devices (HHVD) and Head-mounted visualization devices (HMVD) are investigated and validated in terms of adaptability, acceptability, and usability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the AR-aided object mapping technology versus other methods is explored through the feedback received from both experts and academia participants, which increases the insight of the technology and provides an intelligent mechanism for semi-skilled/ new workers to handle complex or challenging operations in the production environment. The studies indicate that object mapping-based AR visualization facilitates increased assembly task efficiency and the minimum number of errors compared to the other guidance modes. Notably, the HMVD affords an increased realism experience, minimized errors, and less completion time compared to the HHVD.","[Eswaran, M.; Bahubalendruni, M. V. A.

Even though union membership has been declining in the US, union members still comprise 10% of the working population and have higher-than-industry average non-fatal illness and injury rates. Due to limited research focused in this area, this study examined whether union membership was associated with worker perceptions of safety climate. Methods: This was a secondary data analysis study utilizing data from the Quality Work Life module from the General Social Survey centered on US workers aged 18 and above. Propensity-score matching was implemented to reduce potential selection bias between unionized and non-unionized workers. Linear regression explored the association between union membership and perceptions of safety climate, controlling for age, sex, education, industry, resource adequacy, supervisor support, co-worker support, and workload. Results: For perceived safety climate (on a 0-16 scale, the higher the more positive), those in union had a lower mean of perceived safety climate (12.44) compared to those not in a union (13.20). Based on the regression results, those who were in a union reported more negative perceptions of their workplace safety climate in a 12-month period (beta = -0.61, p < .001). Conclusions: By demonstrating a commitment to proactive injury prevention and bolstering the business's overall safety performance indicators, businesses who are open to collaborations with unions may see some long-term benefits (e.g. return on investment, increased job satisfaction) and enhance union workers' perceptions of safety climate.","[Le, Aurora B.] Univ Michigan, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Le, Aurora B.; Lin, Hsien-Chang; Smith, Todd D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Appl Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Wong, Su-Wei] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Hlth Promot & Behav Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health,"Le, AB (corresponding author), M6242,1415 Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",aurorale@umich.edu; Su-Wei.Wong@uth.tmc.edu; linhsi@indiana.edu; smithtod@indiana.edu,"Smith, Todd/AAI-1590-2021; Wong, Su-Wei/ABH-8079-2020; Le, Aurora/AAD-5005-2022","Smith, Todd/0000-0003-4306-3565; Le, Aurora/0000-0002-6866-6779; Wong, Su-Wei/0000-0003-0307-7815",,,,,100,9,10,4,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

Among the various types of sorting systems used for handling express items, cross-belt sorting systems stand out as the most crucial. However, despite their high degree of automation, the workload for operators has intensified owing to the surging volume of express items. In the era of Industry 5.0, it is imperative to adopt new technologies that not only enhance worker welfare but also improve the efficiency of cross-belt systems. Striking a balance between efficiency in handling express items and operator well-being is challenging. Digital twin technology offers a promising solution in this respect. A realization method of a human-machine integrated digital twin is proposed in this study, enabling the interaction of biological human bodies, virtual human bodies, virtual equipment, and logistics equipment in a closed loop, thus setting an operating framework. Key technologies in the proposed framework include a collection of heterogeneous data from multiple sources, construction of the relationship between operator fatigue and operation efficiency based on physiological measurements, virtual model construction, and an online optimization module based on real-time simulation.

In order to distribute the workload evenly over all the workers in the line, some of the industries resorted to the practice of rotating all the workers through all workstations in the cell (Nagare cell) that prevents monotony and boredom. The presence of automated equipment in the cell will hamper this strategy for job rotation. This study aims to demonstrate the application of ergonomically designed looping layout in the assembly cell in the labor demanded lean manufacturing environment. The study was conducted in a process line in an automobile ancillary unit. The current process line which was conventional U-shaped line was simulated and the productivity has been verified and validated with the real life environment. Process map showed that the operators walked long distances, felt stress in certain workstations and that inventory piled up at the bottleneck workstation. We identify sub-cells within the cell. With the same manpower, we develop a new layout (Suzhal) and make workers rotate within each sub-cell. The proposed layout was simulated and results have been compared with the current layout. The analysis shows a reduction in the total operating cycle time, higher alertness among operators, better distribution of workloads in the group and hence higher productivity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper addresses the problem of assigning workers to tasks in a workshop system. In this context, recent researches have focused on the ergonomics assessment, often neglecting the evaluation of the workers' performance. This study aims to formulate a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the workforce scheduling problem and improve the performance of the system integrating ergonomics and human skills. To overcome the complexity of the combinatorial problem, a constructive heuristic procedure is developed. Moreover, a novel approach is proposed to determine the workers' skills. Human performance is modelled in terms of the time required to perform consecutive tasks, considering different sequences of tasks. In addition, the model was applied to a real case study to verify its feasibility. Different scenarios are tested, considering different levels of exposure to different risk factors. The results indicate that a limited increase in the makespan enables decreasing the risk level and the achievement of an excellent workload balance among workers in terms of time spent in performing tasks. Moreover, the heuristic procedure has demonstrated to perform well on instances of realistic size, and it could be adapted to many manufacturing systems to solve the problem in real industrial contexts.","[Rinaldi, Marta; Fera, Marcello] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Engn, Via Roma 29, I-81031 Aversa, Italy; [Bottani, Eleonora] Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture, Viale GP Usberti 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Grosse, Eric H.] Saarland Univ, Juniorprofessorship Digital Transformat Operat Ma, Campus C3 1, D-66041 Saarbrucken, Germany",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Parma; Saarland University,"Rinaldi, M (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Engn, Via Roma 29, I-81031 Aversa, Italy.",marta.rinaldi@unicampania.it,"Grosse, Eric/AAG-2538-2019; Fera, Marcello/I-1284-2019; Bottani, Eleonora/F-9285-2012","Grosse, Eric/0000-0001-6299-1282",,,,,54,14,14,6,35,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

However, the gap in the understanding of the closed-loop driver-vehicle interaction often leads to reduced user acceptance. In this article, an optimal torque control law is calculated online in the model predictive control (MPC) framework to guarantee continuous guidance during the steering task. The research contribution is in the integration of an extensive prediction model covering cognitive behavior, neuromuscular dynamics, and the vehicle-steering dynamics, within the MPC-based haptic controller to enhance collaboration. The driver model is composed of a preview cognitive strategy based on a linear-quadratic-gaussian, sensory organs, and neuromuscular dynamics, including muscle coactivation and reflex action. Moreover, an adaptive cost-function algorithm enables dynamic allocation of the control authority. Experiments were performed in a fixed-base driving simulator at Toyota Motor Europe involving 19 participants to evaluate the proposed controller with two different cost functions against a commercial lane keeping assist system as an industry benchmark. The results demonstrate the proposed controller fosters symbiotic driving and reduces driver-vehicle conflicts with respect to a state-of-the-art commercial system, both subjectively and objectively, while still improving the path-tracking performance.

This study assessed the association between worker characteristics, workplace factors, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in Nigeria's construction industry. Methods. A cross-sectional site-by-site survey was conducted in 5 existing construction companies in Uyo, Nigeria. The subjects (n = 1200 males), aged 18-55 years, filled in the semistructured Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire and the job content questionnaire on demographics, work and lifestyle characteristics, and workplace risk factors for WMSDs. Results. The overall prevalence of WMSDs was 39.25%. Differences in age, race, weight, body mass index (BMI), education status, and employment status were significantly associated with the prevalence of WMSDs. Prevalence according to trade was as follows: ironworkers highest at 49% and administrative staff lowest at 31%. Ironworkers (55.7%), administrative staff (53.3%), and security staff (38.7%) scored higher on physical, psychosocial, and individual risk factors, respectively. Workplace factors with increased odds for WMSDs were psychological demands and mental workload, age, BMI, low work experience, low education status, awkward movement of head and arms, working against force or vibration, fast work pace, and race.

Then, a linear model was developed to predict workers' risk perception based on ERP components and quantify the relative importance of severity to likelihood. Finally, an additive model was constructed to reflect the risk perception pattern. The results indicate: (1) Workers' emotional responses stem from the process of associating accident consequences in severity assessment, which is represented by the late positive potential (LPP) component. (2) Workers' risk perception relies more on severity compared with likelihood. (3) The additive model (risk = 0.203 * likelihood +0.758 * severity) better matches the risk perception patterns than the multiplicative model.

Further, it is believed that the investment and maintenance costs of the automated systems may be higher than labour costs. This study considers a ceramic tile line where workers are assigned to identify tile surface defects. Main aim is to attract attention to differences between novice and expert workers in terms of visual scanning performance and mental workload indicators that result from high concentration during visual inspection. A mobile type eye-tracker is used to record the data for duration of fixation and number of fixations to determine fatigue that arises over a period of working time. Data are analysed and it is concluded that the eye tracking systems have a potential to identify human related problems during visual inspection.","[Ulutas, Berna; Ozkan, N.

This robot is potentially myopic, i.e., its request could be based on partial and limited information. Therefore, it could possibly be faulty. This exploratory study aims to analyze whether multidimensional agent transparency may have an effect on two drivers of compliance identified in the literature: trust in signal and risk perception. In this experiment, we manipulated different agent transparency levels combined with two dimensions of agent transparency: robot-TO-human transparency (rTOh) and robot-OF-human transparency (rOFh). Results mainly show that adding rOFh to rTOh transparency changes human compliance with the agent and moderates both trust and risk perception. Moreover, task performance and completion time are shown to vary according to the different transparency levels. Our results show that transparency has no effect on mental workload. From a methodological perspective, this article shows the importance of distinguishing the different types of information about which a robot can be transparent, especially the combination of rTOh and rOFh transparencies. From a practical point of view, the article shows that the agent transparency framework needs to be considered carefully when designing human-robot teaming in the context of Industry 4.0 in the case of robots that may be unreliable due to their myopia.","[Simon, Loick; Guerin, Clement; Rauffet, Philippe; Chauvin, Christine; Martin, Eric] Univ South Brittany, Lab STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, F-56321 Lorient, France",,"Simon, L (corresponding author), Univ South Brittany, Lab STICC, CNRS UMR 6285, F-56321 Lorient, France.",loick.simon@univ-ubs.fr; clement.guerin@univ-ubs.fr; philippe.rauffet@univ-ubs.fr; christine.chauvin@univ-ubs.fr; eric.martin@univ-ubs.fr,"GUERIN, Clément/AAX-3405-2020; Chauvin, Christine/HDN-2711-2022; SIMON, Loick/HSF-3527-2023; Rauffet, Philippe/JRY-3261-2023","Chauvin, Christine/0000-0003-3721-8831; Simon, Loick/0000-0003-3106-3787; Rauffet, Philippe/0000-0002-6179-4348; GUERIN, Clement/0000-0003-1544-1602",HUMANISM [ANR-17-CE10-0009]; French National Research Agency,HUMANISM; French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work was supported by the HUMANISM No ANR-17-CE10-0009 research program, funded by the French National Research Agency.",,45,2,2,5,17,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2291,2168-2305,,IEEE T HUM-MACH SYST,IEEE T.

The study involved a total of 32 volunteers of various ages, with no previous experience of cobots. An eye-tracker system that records a range of biometric data was used to quantify stress. Pupil diameter was mainly used in this investigation, as well as the number of gaze fixations by zones. The data registered were analyzed using the T-test method, with which data on two groups can be compared to test for significant differences. In addition, other secondary parameters were also analyzed, such as the time required to complete each test, and the number of errors that were committed. Among the most important conclusions, it was noted that working with cobots in no way increased stress levels, confirming one of the objectives for which these robots were designed.","[Mariscal, Miguel A.; Ortiz Barcina, Sergio; Garcia Herrero, Susana] Univ Burgos, Escuela Politecn Super, Burgos, Spain; [Lopez Perea, Eva Maria] Univ Burgos, Burgos, Spain",Universidad de Burgos; Universidad de Burgos,"Barcina, SO (corresponding author), Univ Burgos, Escuela Politecn Super, Burgos, Spain.",sobarcina@ubu.es,,,Department of Employment of the Regional Government of Castile and Leon; General Directorate of Labour and Occupational Risk Prevention [INVESTUN/21/BU/0005],Department of Employment of the Regional Government of Castile and Leon; General Directorate of Labour and Occupational Risk Prevention,This work was supported by the Department of Employment of the Regional Government of Castile and Leon and the General Directorate of Labour and Occupational Risk Prevention under Grant INVESTUN/21/BU/0005 and is part of the research project 'Occupational risk prevention in Industry 4.0.

In line with this, a team-based approach is generally adopted for task assignment to workers in construction operations. However, this approach tends to disregard the differences between skill level, experience, capabilities, learning rates and fatigue rates of different individual workers forming the team. In particular, due to differences in visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor capabilities of different workers and brain resource demands of different activities, the traditional approach may result in inconsistent workloads and uneven fatigue rates within a crew, affecting the workers' and crew's safety negatively. This paper proposes a novel framework for task assignment to construction workers in which safety of individual workers and thus the crew is ensured through optimizing workload distributions within a crew. The framework computes visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor requirements of the jobs assigned to a worker and minimizes the identified workload imbalances through collaborative execution of shared tasks. The application of the proposed framework is examined on a pipe spool fabrication operation of a refinery project in a simulation environment.","[Fini, Alireza Ahmadian Fard] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Akbarnezhad, Ali; Rashidi, Taha H.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Waller, S.

Agriculture is described as one of the most dangerous industry in Poland. Based on these circumstances the studies were conducted where the main objective was to investigate a workload during agricultural manual and mechanized tasks. The analysis was conducted on 15 farmers on their own farms during the morning and evening milking in the tethering and carousel systems while lifting and carrying a full bucket or a sack and while the tractor was moving. The analysis of muscle load was conducted with the surface EMG (Electromyography) system and Job Strain Index method. The highest values of muscle tension and force were observed in the forearm muscles during the attachment of teat cups to the udder. It was connected with lifting the equipment in an uncomfortable posture assumed by the milker. For the tractor driver the ergonomics of the seat and steering wheel was measured. It has been demonstrated that unfavourable working conditions increase the musculoskeletal overload. One of the methods of preventing them is to create appropriate working conditions for a specific person and gender. This will allow each worker to properly adjust the work and to apply specific matching equipment. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, there are several obstacles and risks slowing down the adoption of this technology, which are primarily related to the human-machine interaction (HMI) and exchange of control between the vehicle and the human driver. In this article, we present key takeaways for HMI design of take-over requests (TOR) that the vehicle issues to inform the driver to take over control of the vehicle. The key takeaways were developed based on the results of a user study, where directional tactile-ambient (visual) and auditory-ambient (visual) TOR user interfaces (UI) were evaluated with regards to commonly used take-over quality aspects (attention redirection, take-over time, correct interpretation of stimuli, off-road drive, brake application, lateral acceleration, minimal time-to-collision and occurrence of collision). 36 participants took part in the mixed design study, which was conducted in a driving simulator. The results showed that drivers' attention was statistically significantly faster redirected with the auditory-ambient UI, however using the tactile-ambient UI resulted in less off-road driving and slightly less collisions. The results also revealed that drivers correctly interpreted the directional TOR stimuli more often than the non-directional one. Based on the study results, a list of key takeaways was developed and is presented in the conclusion of the paper. The results from this study are especially relevant to the TOR UI designers and the automotive industry, which tend to provide the most usable UI for ensuring safer end efficient human-vehicle interaction during the TOR task.","[Gruden, Timotej; Tomazic, Saso; Sodnik, Jaka; Jakus, Grega] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Trzaska Cesta 25, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Gruden, T (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Trzaska Cesta 25, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",timotej.gruden@fe.uni-lj.si,,"Gruden, Timotej/0000-0002-8099-9832",Slovenian Research Agency [P2-0246]; research project Neurophysiological and Cognitive Profiling of Driving Skills [L2-8178]; European Union [875597],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); research project Neurophysiological and Cognitive Profiling of Driving Skills; European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency within the research program ICT4QoL-Information and Communications Technologies for Quality of Life [grant number P2-0246] ; and the research project Neurophysiological and Cognitive Profiling of Driving Skills [grant number L2-8178] ; and partially co-funded by HADRIAN (Holistic Approach for Driver Role Integration and Automation-Allocation for European Mobility Needs) , which has received funding from the European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [grant agreement number 875597] .",,73,14,14,17,109,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0001-4575,1879-2057,,ACCIDENT ANAL PREV,Accid.

Extensive research has been conducted to explore how drivers interact with automated vehicles across diverse scenarios. This article presents a meta-analysis of 42 papers to examine the influence of non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs) on takeover time (TOT). To consolidate the effect of NDRTs on TOT, this paper classified the NDRTs into four dimensions (visual, auditory, motoric, and mental), which aimed to provide a unified understanding of this impact. This paper employed the following three analyses to understand this impact. Firstly, a synthetical analysis was conducted to compare the effect sizes across primary studies. Secondly, a two-group analysis was performed on studies that included eligible control and experiment groups. Lastly, a moderator analysis, incorporating seven potential moderators, was conducted to further explore the underlying mechanism. The results from the synthetical and two-group analyses revealed that both visual-mental-motoric (Vi-Me-Mo) and visual-mental (Vi-Me) tasks could increase TOT, with the former having a greater effect than the latter. The moderator analysis, including subgroup analysis and meta-regression, further confirmed the significance of moderators within their respective subgroups. However, most moderators exhibited non-significant effects across different scenarios. The findings of this study underscore the crucial importance of attending to TOT and tailoring automated driving systems based on individual driver characteristics. Furthermore, this paper contributes significantly to the advancement of scientific research and engineering design by providing valuable insights into the automotive industry.","[Hu, Wenbo; Zhang, Yan; Chan, Alan Hoi Shou] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wenbo; Chan, Alan Hoi Shou] City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tingru] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Human Factors & Ergon, Coll Mechatron & Control Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","City University of Hong Kong; Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; Shenzhen University","Zhang, TR (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Inst Human Factors & Ergon, Coll Mechatron & Control Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",wenbo_hu2018@163.com; zhangtr@szu.edu.cn; yzhang2332-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; alan.chan@cityu.edu.hk,"Zhang, Tingru/KFB-2954-2024; Hu, Wenbo/GYE-2402-2022","Hu, Wenbo/0000-0002-4534-3942; Zhang, Tingru/0000-0003-2395-1864; Zhang, Yan/0000-0003-2142-5094",National Natural Science Foundation of China [72071170]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2024A1515030219]; Foundation of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [JCYJ20210324100014040],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Foundation of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 72071170) , the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant number 2024A1515030219) , and the Foundation of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (grant number JCYJ20210324100014040) .",,93,2,2,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1369-8478,1873-5517,,TRANSPORT RES F-TRAF,Transp.

Moreover, recently, there has been a shift towards a human-centered design of the workspace, known as one of the drivers of Industry 5.0, which prioritizes the well-being of operators. To achieve this, various human factors such as ergonomics, mental workload, personal skills, and capabilities need to be considered in the workspace design, and their impact on system productivity must be evaluated. The integration of a human and a cobot in the same workplace can affect the performance of the human operator, as the perception of the cobot can impact their work. This highlights the importance of taking human factors into account, as a lack of consideration in these aspects has contributed to the failure of many implementations. To link the objectives of productivity, flexibility, and human factors consideration, a dynamic real-time multi-objective task allocation strategy for collaborative assembly systems is developed. This approach considers the different characteristics of the resources and optimizes for two objectives, makespan, and energy expenditure of the operator. By using this approach, it is possible to modify the behavior of the cobot by reallocating tasks between the two resources based on the operator's current needs. In other words, if the operator appears too stressed due to time constraints or their energy rate level is too high, some of their assigned tasks can be transferred to the cobot. This helps to maintain a balanced system while reducing the operator's stress.","[Calzavara, Martina; Faccio, Maurizio; Granata, Irene; Trevisani, Alberto] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy",University of Padua,"Granata, I (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",irene.granata@phd.unipd.it,"Granata, Irene/GLU-2097-2022","Granata, Irene/0000-0001-6233-176X",Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) [ECS_00000043],Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR)(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU)),"Open access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

However, it may not be economical by simply scheduling production loads to the periods with lower electricity prices, as these periods often have higher labor wage, e.g., nights and weekends. Based on this gap, this paper proposes a many-objective integrated energy- and labor-aware flexible job shop scheduling model. Many objectives refer to the number of optimization objectives surpasses three (i.e., five objectives: makespan, total energy cost, total labor cost, maximal workload, and total workload), whereas the existing energy-aware production scheduling research is limited within three objectives. To enable energy awareness in the conventional production scheduling algorithms, a state-based shop floor wide energy model is proposed. To enable labor awareness, the number and type of human workers are matched to the scheduled production loads, with varying labor wage over shifts. As one of the most complex shop floor configurations, the partial flexible job shop further considers job recirculation and operation sequence-dependent machine setup times. The recently-proposed nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is tailored for this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), including scheduling solution encoding and decoding, crossover, mutation, and solution evaluation using the energy- and labor-aware discrete-event simulation framework. Through numerical experiments under real-time pricing (RTP) and time-of-use pricing (ToUP), insights are statistically obtained on the relation among these five production objectives: the effectiveness and efficiency of NSGA-III in solving a MaOP are also demonstrated. This proposed scheduling method can be used to automated and enhance the decision making of factory managers in jointly allocating machine, human worker, and energy resources on the shop floor, such that the production cost is minimized even under time-varying electricity and labor prices.

Such fatalities have decreased considerably due to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, the manual monitoring of compliance to PPE is complex and challenging for site managers. Automation in construction safety presents multiple solutions for monitoring safety at sites. In this study, a smart safety hook (SSH) monitoring method is proposed to eliminate the risk associated with FFH accidents by integrating computer vision [closed-circuit TV (CCTV)-imagery] and Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based [inertial measurement unit (IMU)IMU and altimeter] monitoring technologies. The proposed monitoring approach is validated through five real-time scenarios: (1) attached to the scaffolding and h > 1.82 m (6 ft), (2) attached to the worker and h > 1.82 m, (3) unattached and h > 1.82 m, (4) h < 1.82 m, and (5) outside of the risk zone. The proposed technique aims to relieve the site manager's or safety engineer's workload by smartly and instantaneously alerting of workers' unsafe behavior (via alarm, LED blinking, and bounding box on live camera feed). Moreover, the IoT-based hardware setup goes to low power to extend the battery life when there is no unsafe behavior. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution exhibits more than 98% accuracy for real-time detection and classification. Furthermore, it can be extended to monitor several workers and their location data in the future.

A key aspect to achieve the best performance in this system lies on the design of an efficient scheduler for component execution, called topology, on the available computing resources. In response to workload fluctuations, we propose an advanced scheduler for Apache Storm that provides improved performance with highly dynamic behavior. While enforcing the required Quality-of-Service (QoS) of individual data streams, the controller allocates computing resources based on decisions that consider the future states of non-controllable disturbance parameters, e.g. arriving rate of tuples or resource utilization in each worker node. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed solution with two well-known alternatives, namely the Storm's default scheduler and the best-effort approach (i.e. the heuristic that is based on the first-fit decreasing approximation algorithm). Experimental results clearly show that the proposed controller increases the overall resource utilization by 31% on average compared to the two others solutions, without significant negative impact on the QoS enforcement level.","[HoseinyFarahabady, M.

Existing research on human-robot collaboration in industry has made progress in enhancing workers' psychophysical states, by optimizing measures of ergonomics risk factors, such as human posture, comfort, and cognitive workload. However, short-term objectives for robotic assistance may conflict with the worker's long-term preferences, needs, and overall wellbeing. Purpose: To investigate the ergonomic advantages and disadvantages of employing a collaborative robotics framework that intentionally imposes variability in the robot's behavior to stimulate the human partner's psychophysical state. Methods: A review of overassistance within human-robot collaboration and methods of addressing this phenomenon via adaptive automation. In adaptive approaches, the robot assistance may even challenge the user to better achieve a long-term objective while partially conflicting with their short-term task goals. Common themes across these approaches were extracted to motivate and support the proposed idea of stimulating robot behavior in physical human-robot collaboration. Results: Experimental evidence to justify stimulating robot behavior is presented through a human-robot handover study. A robot handover policy that regularly injects variability into the object transfer location led to significantly larger dynamics in the torso rotations and center of mass of human receivers compared to an overassistive policy that constrains receiver motion. Crucially, the stimulating handover policy also generated improvements in widely used ergonomics risk indicators of human posture. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the potential ergonomic benefits of a cobot's actions imposing variability in a user's responsive behavior, rather than indirectly restricting human behavior by optimizing the immediate task objective. Therefore, a transition from cobot policies that optimize instantaneous measures of ergonomics to those that continuously engage users could hold promise for human-robot collaboration in occupational settings characterized by repeated interactions.","[Zolotas, Mark; Bazzi, Salah; Saha, Dipanjan; Padir, Taskin] Northeastern Univ, Inst Expt Robot, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Luo, Rui; Padir, Taskin] Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA USA; [Mabulu, Katiso] Northeastern Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Boston, MA USA; [Kloeckl, Kristian] Northeastern Univ, Dept Art??Design, Boston, MA USA; [Kloeckl, Kristian] Northeastern Univ, Sch Architecture, Boston, MA USA",Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University; Northeastern University,"Zolotas, M (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Inst Expt Robot, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",m.zolotas@northeastern.edu,"Padir, Taskin/AAF-5524-2020; Zolotas, Mark/Y-5893-2019","Zolotas, Mark/0000-0002-7672-940X",National Science Foundation [1928654],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. 1928654.,,47,1,1,6,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2472-5838,2472-5846,,IISE T OCCUP ERG HUM,IISE Trans.

At the same time, these systems aim to maintain or even increase productivity. The challenges risen from these developments can be tackled through human-robot collaboration (HRC). HRC requires effective task distribution according to each party's distinctive strengths, which is envisioned to generate synergetic effects. To enable a seamless collaboration, the human and robot require a mutual awareness, which is challenging, due to the human and robot speaking different languages as in analogue and digital. This challenge can be addressed by equipping the robot with a model of the human. Despite a range of models being available, data-driven models of the human are still at an early stage. For this purpose, this paper proposes an adaptive human sensor framework, which incorporates objective, subjective, and physiological metrics, as well as associated machine learning. Thus, it is envisioned to adapt to the uniqueness and dynamic nature of human behavior. To test the framework, a validation experiment was performed, including 18 participants, which aims to predict perceived workload during two scenarios, namely a manual and an HRC assembly task. Perceived workloads are described to have a substantial impact on a human operator's task performance. Throughout the experiment, physiological data from an electroencephalogram (EEG), an electrocardiogram (ECG), and respiration sensor was collected and interpreted. For subjective metrics, the standardized NASA Task Load Index was used. Objective metrics included task completion time and number of errors/assistance requests. Overall, the framework revealed a promising potential towards an adaptive behavior, which is ultimately envisioned to enable a more effective HRC.","[Buerkle, Achim; Matharu, Harveen; Al-Yacoub, Ali; Lohse, Niels; Bamber, Thomas; Ferreira, Pedro] Loughborough Univ, Intelligent Automat Ctr, Wolfson Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Buerkle, A (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Intelligent Automat Ctr, Wolfson Sch Mech Elect & Mfg Engn, Loughborough, Leics, England.",a.buerkle@lboro.ac.uk,"Lohse, Niels/AAB-6597-2021; Ferreira, Pedro/JVN-2767-2024","Lohse, Niels/0000-0001-7279-8849; Buerkle, Achim/0000-0002-0625-6475; Al-Yacoub, Ali/0000-0003-2010-9882",EPSRC [EP/R032718/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,46,22,23,1,18,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

This study explores relationships and morale levels between employees and supervisors in a large service industry. An open-ended questionnaire developed based on literature was created to assess morale and motivation, support, incentive, workplace environment, way of motivation, and job satisfaction. This survey was then piloted to managers of hourly product handlers working in a large North American distribution company. Data on existing status of employee morale and the factors influencing morale were collected from managers of three different departments responsible for supervising product handlers. The survey was administered using an online survey tool and answered by a sample of 44 respondents. Poor employee morale and negative attitudes toward their jobs were reported. Influencing factors included minimal pay and hours, lack of motivation, understaffed and unskilled labor, high physical workload, and poor supervision. Manager feedback indicated employees had a lack of understand of company mission and vision but also demonstrated a potential disconnect at the worker and manager levels. Potential interventions such as increasing employee-supervisor interaction, promoting good behavior, offering non-monetary benefits, training, wage rate and employee selection consistency, job redesign, etc. were recommended to management for implementation to improve existing conditions.","[Nur, Farjana] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Starkville, MS USA; [Harrison, Dean; Deb, Shuchisnigdha; Burch, Reuben F., V; Strawderman, Lesley] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Dept Ind Mfg & Syst Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Burch, Reuben F., V] Mississippi State Univ, Ctr Adv Vehicular Syst CAVS, Starkville, MS USA",Mississippi State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; Mississippi State University,"Burch, VRF (corresponding author), 260I McCain Engn Bldg, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",burch@ise.msstate.edu,"Strawderman, Lesley/E-4748-2015","Strawderman, Lesley/0000-0002-4742-6610; Burch, Reuben/0000-0003-2944-1945",,,,,43,3,7,2,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1916,,,COGENT ENG,Cogent Eng.,JAN 1,2021,8.0,1,,,,,,,1914287,10.1080/23311916.2021.1914287,0.0,,,17,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,RO8HW,,gold,,,2024-11-14,WOS:000641282800001,0,employee morale; employee dissatisfaction; employee-supervisor relationship; morale interventions; employee retention; WORKPLACE; QUALITY; DAMAGE; CARE

This manual welding requires a variety of working postures, which have become an important determinant of the worker's workload and, consequently, assembly man-hours. Currently, major shipyards calculate welding man-hours by reflecting the welding factor, which is defined as the working time consumed in the welding process. A set of welding factors is known to be based on the accumulated experience in shipyards, whereas the verification or derivation process for these factors is not disclosed or available. This study proposed a method for quantitatively calculating work difficulty for welding positions based on the working posture in a process where the posture acts as an important variable. Standard welding positions reflecting the actual welding work at shipyards were established. A physiological assessment method was used to propose the physical welding factor by analyzing the measured muscle activity. The validity of the proposed method was verified by comparing the results of a musculoskeletal simulation package and shipyard welding factors. The proposed method can be readily applied to other fields in which workers' physical activities are involved.","[Baek, So-Yeon; Nam, Jong-Ho] Korea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Syst Engn, Busan 49112, South Korea",Korea Maritime & Ocean University,"Nam, JH (corresponding author), Korea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Syst Engn, Busan 49112, South Korea.",jhnam@kmou.ac.kr,,"Nam, Jong-Ho/0000-0002-9613-477X; Baek, soyeon/0000-0003-1149-5312","Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of Korea [20000208]","Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of Korea","This research was supported in part by the project Development of master data system of lead time for precision enhancement of shipbuilding production management (project ID: 20000208), sponsored by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of Korea.",,34,3,3,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

Concurrently, the critical role of hazard identification (HI) in ensuring worker safety is well-documented. Despite this, studies delving into HMD AR's impact on HI, especially across varying task complexities, are limited. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the influence of HMD AR on construction workers' HI in diverse task environments. The research engaged 48 participants in an experiment to evaluate their hazard situation awareness (HSA), cognitive load (CL), and task performance (TP). These were assessed using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), the Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and measures of task accuracy. Findings indicated that environmental conditions significantly modulate HMD AR's effect on HI. In simple and safe scenes, HMD AR has a negligible impact on HI and might enhance hazard detection capabilities. However, in complex and hazardous situations with intense workloads, HMD AR can impair HI, potentially increasing safety risks. In other words, whether HMD AR brings opportunities or risks for HI depends on the different environmental conditions. This research contributes to the nascent field of cognitive safety in HMD AR, specifically regarding HI in construction, augmenting the current understanding and laying a theoretical groundwork for HMD AR's future safety applications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The insights gained inform the prudent implementation, training, and interface design of HMD AR on construction sites. In the context of HMD AR's rapid evolution, this study underscores the importance of critically assessing safety implications to guide the responsible utilization of new technologies. The findings from this study reveal that the impact of HMD AR on HI is contingent upon the complexity and safety of the work environment. In scenes that are straightforward and safe, HMD AR has been shown to improve HI among participants. Conversely, in environments that are complex and fraught with danger, HMD AR may hinder HI, increasing the likelihood of hazards. The conclusions of this study suggest that the safety management and application of HMD AR on construction sites should consider the opportunities and risks of using HMD AR in different environmental conditions. It is advised that decision makers on construction sites evaluate the suitability of HMD AR deployment based on the specific complexities of their scenes. In instances where the potential hazards are intricate, the use of HMD AR might be inadvisable. For sites already utilizing HMD AR, it is crucial to provide additional safety training to users. Such training should aim to enhance awareness of how HMD AR might affect HI, equipping workers with the knowledge to mitigate potential risks effectively. Furthermore, developers of HMD AR technologies are encouraged to focus on improving the safety features of their products. A key area of improvement is the optimization of information density on the HMD AR display interface. By doing so, developers can help prevent cognitive overload among users, thereby minimizing any adverse effects on HI. This approach not only enhances the safety on construction sites but also ensures that the benefits of HMD AR can be fully realized without compromising worker safety.","[Liu, Jiale; Yan, Xiaoli] Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Management, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wenmin] Shanghai Jiguang Polytech Coll, Sch Architecture Engn, Shanghai 201901, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Engineering Science,"Yan, XL (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Management, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.",M330122504@sues.edu.cn; yanxiaoli821@163.com; xue3xi1234@163.com,,,Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation Plan of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission [23692109200],Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation Plan of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission,The authors thank the funding of the Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation Plan of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (23692109200) and insightful suggestions from the anonymous reviewers and the editors.

Deliveries of a Return Rolls (RR) involve the use of a hand truck and, in many cases, a shoulder/elbow-mode of carriage. Workers usually prefer to the Gendong (carrying on the small of the back or the hip, supported by the waist and arm) mode or Manggul (carrying on some stuff shoulder) mode, because they feel safer by carrying RR on the shoulder/elbow. In this study, the physiological workload involved in shoulder/elbow-mode carrying was investigated, especially focusing on the effects of load weight and inclination. To measure heart rate and oxygen uptake while carrying on the shoulder/elbow, a laboratory experiment was conducted and safety guidelines for such tasks were proposed, based on the experimental results. Four healthy male subjects performed shoulder/elbow-mode carrying, weight between 20 and 24 kg: (1) on inclination of 10 degrees, (2) 20 degrees and (3) 30 degrees. The results showed that inclination involved an increased physiological burden, and that a load of 24 kg entailed a significantly higher physiological cost than carrying a load of 20 kg. Although shoulder/elbow-mode carrying has some advantages, the worker should be advised to carry a load of less than 20 kg, to avoid a high physiological load. During shoulder/elbow-mode carrying, it is also recommended that a person prepare more training in order to have muscular strength.","[Nurmianto, E.; Ciptomulyono, U.; Suparno] Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Ind Engn, Kampus ITS, Sukolilo Surabaya 60111, Indonesia; [Kromodihardjo, S.] Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Mech Engn, Kampus ITS, Sukolilo Surabaya 60111, Indonesia; [Setijono, H.; Arief, N.

This is due to the fact that we are still living in the so-called Industry 4.0, with its cornerstone of high-productivity systems. However, there is also a migration toward Industry 5.0 that includes the human-centered design of the workplace as one of its principles. This means that the operators have to be put in the center of the design techniques in order to maximize their wellness. Among the wide set of new technologies, collaborative robots (cobots) represent one such technology that modern production systems are trying to integrate, because of their characteristic of working directly with the human operators, allowing for a mix of the flexibility of the manual systems with the productivity of the automated ones. This paper focuses on the impact that these technologies have on different levels within a production plant and on the improvement of the collaborative experience. At the workstation level, the control methodologies are investigated and developed: technologies such as computer vision and augmented reality can be applied to aid and guide the activities of the cobot, in order to obtain the following results. The first is an increase in the overall productivity generated by the reduction of idle times and safety stops and the minimization of the effort required to the operator during the work. This can be achieved through a multiobjective task allocation which aims to simultaneoulsy minimize the makespan, for productivity requirements, and the operator's energy expenditure and mental workload, for wellness requirements. The second is a safe, human-centered, workspace in which collisions can be avoided in real time. This can be achieved by using real-time multicamera systems and skeleton tracking to constantly know where the operator is in the work cell. The system will offer the possibility of directing feedback based on the discrepancies between the physical world and the virtual models in order to dynamically reallocate the tasks to the resources if the requirements are not satisfied anymore. This allows the application of the technology to sectors that require constant process control, improving also the human-robot interaction: the human operator and the cobot are not merely two single resources working in the same cell, but they can achieve a real human-robot collaboration. In this paper, a framework is preented that allows us to reach the different aforementioned goals.","[Boschetti, Giovanni] Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Via Venezia 1, I-35100 Padua, Italy; [Faccio, Maurizio; Granata, Irene] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy",University of Padua; University of Padua,"Granata, I (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",irene.granata@unipd.it,"Granata, Irene/GLU-2097-2022","Granata, Irene/0000-0001-6233-176X; Boschetti, Giovanni/0000-0003-2452-221X",,,,,60,12,12,4,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JAN,2023,12.0,1,,,,,,,167,10.3390/electronics12010167,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,7Q4DL,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-14,WOS:000909343400001,0,cobot; motion capture; safety; human factors; human-centered design; human-robot collaboration; Industry 4; 0; Industry 5; MOTION CAPTURE; TASK ALLOCATION; ERGONOMICS; APPLICABILITY; COOPERATION; FRAMEWORK; ACCURACY; SYSTEM; SPEED; TIME

Using computer vision technology to detect PV panel surface defects can ensure better accuracy while reducing the workload of traditional worker field inspections. However, multiple tiny defects on the PV panel surface and the high similarity between different defects make it challenging to accurately identify and detect such defects. This paper proposes an approach named Ghost convolution with BottleneckCSP and a tiny target prediction head incorporating YOLOv5 (GBH-YOLOv5) for PV panel defect detection. To ensure better accuracy on multiscale targets, the BottleneckCSP module is introduced to add a prediction head for tiny target detection to alleviate tiny defect misses, using Ghost convolution to improve the model inference speed and reduce the number of parameters. First, the original image is compressed and cropped to enlarge the defect size physically. Then, the processed images are input into GBH-YOLOv5, and the depth features are extracted through network processing based on Ghost convolution, the application of the BottleneckCSP module, and the prediction head of tiny targets. Finally, the extracted features are classified by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a Path Aggregation Network (PAN) structure. Meanwhile, we compare our method with state-of-the-art methods to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

SMC is a filter trading company that involves business processes such as inventory, packing, and delivery. Manual material handling activities in the packing process are considered non-ergonomic and can lead to musculoskeletal disorders. One of the packing process activities is plastic wrapping on crates, in which workers carry 12 kg of plastic rolls around a 120x120x150 cm crate, starting from a bending position and lifting the plastic roll to a standing position. The goal of this study was to analyze and improve the wrapping process in terms of ergonomics and productivity. To assess the condition of activities, the Nordic Body Map and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) methods were used. In addition, a plastic wrapping tool is designed to help the worker in packing activities, and the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method was used to develop the design process. According to the results of the nordic body map data, many workers have a complaint of pain in the waist and right hand. Using the REBA assessment for the existing condition was obtained the risk level of the lower position was very high, the risk level of the middle position and the upper position were high, while the output of the wrapping processes was 19 pallets per day. Three tool designs were developed, and the plastic wrapping trolley was selected as the best design. After using tools, the research shows that the plastic wrapping procedure in. PT. SMC is classified as non-ergonomic, causing a high risk of harm to the waist and right hand. By using the quality function deployment approach, a wrapping trolley is chosen to be manufactured, and the end REBA value is 3, indicating a low risk level. Another benefit shows that, there was an increase in manufacturing output specifically from 19 pallets/day to 37 pallets/day.","[Syafei, M.

In our experimental study involving 24 participants, we designed a scenario for shared-space human-robot collaboration (HRC) for a material sorting task. When compared to a sequential mode of interaction, the simultaneous mode resulted in significantly higher perceptions of fluency and engagement, primarily by reducing human idle time. These observations were complemented by significant changes in physiological responses, such as ECG entropy and low frequency power. These responses could predict fluency and engagement with accuracies of 90 and 97%, respectively. Notably, the perception of fluency and preferred mode of interaction were influenced by individual preferences. Hence, it is crucial to consider both physiological responses and user preferences when designing HRC systems, to ensure a positive experience with the robot teammate and to foster engagement in long-term teamwork. Furthermore, these signals can be obtained using a single robust, low-cost, and comfortable sensor. BackgroundIn the current industry, a key enabler of flexible manufacturing is human-robot collaboration (HRC), a scenario wherein a human and a robot interact and work together in a shared space to accomplish a common task. In HRC, the timing and coordination between the human and robot are crucial factors that impact the fluency, efficacy, and acceptance of human-robot teams.PurposeExperimental research on the physiological indicators of fluency in human-robot collaborative tasks in a shared workspace is still in its infancy. We posit that by relating the mental perceptions of fluency to features from physiological signals, we could bring more clarity to the complex mapping between subjective and objective measures of fluency.MethodsTwenty-four participants (12 males and 12 females), with mean (SD) age = 25.7 (2.9) years, completed an experimental study. We investigated the effects of interaction mode (sequential, simultaneous) and level of human involvement (low, medium, high) on perceived fluency, engagement, performance, and physiological response (heart rate variability = HRV) in a collaborative item sorting task.ResultsThe simultaneous mode of interaction and a higher level of human involvement led to higher ratings for fluency and engagement, along with ECG changes, specifically an 11.6% increase in low-frequency power and a 3% reduction in information entropy. Using machine learning, these HRV features could predict perceived fluency and engagement with 90 and 97% accuracy, respectively.ConclusionOur results indicate that a human operator's perceived fluency in human-robot collaborative tasks can be measured using HRV metrics. Our findings expand the current fluency framework from a physiological perspective and offer additional objective measures derived from HRV, which could be practically applied to improve the design and optimization of HRC systems.","[Ramadurai, Sruthi; Kim, Myunghee] Univ Illinois, Coll Engn, Mech & Ind Engn Dept, Chicago, IL USA; [Gutierrez, Christian] Univ Illinois, Coll Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Chicago, IL USA; [Jeong, Heejin] Arizona State Univ, Polytech Sch, Ira A Fulton Sch Engn, Mesa, AZ USA; [Jeong, Heejin; Kim, Myunghee] Univ Illinois, Coll Engn, Mech & Ind Engn Dept, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Arizona State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Jeong, H; Kim, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Engn, Mech & Ind Engn Dept, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",Heejin.Jeong@asu.edu; myheekim@uic.edu,"Jeong, Heejin/X-7062-2019","Kim, Myunghee/0000-0001-8965-6206; Jeong, Heejin/0000-0002-0122-532X","Occupational Safety and Health, ERC, University of Illinois at Chicago under NIOSH Grant [T42/OH008672]","Occupational Safety and Health, ERC, University of Illinois at Chicago under NIOSH Grant","This work was supported by the Occupational Safety and Health, ERC, University of Illinois at Chicago under NIOSH Grant # T42/OH008672.

Large-herd dairy parlor workers experience a high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the upper extremity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of an alternative teat scrubber (TS) cow preparation method on upper extremity muscle activity among large-herd parlor workers, as well compare to muscle activity associated with conventional manual milking tasks. Methods: Upper extremity muscle activity was recorded among U.S. large-herd parlor workers (n = 15) using surface electromyography. Participants performed multiple task cycles, using both conventional and TS methods. Muscle activity levels were then compared across conventional manual and TS milking tasks. Results: Conventional manual milking tasks of dip, strip and wipe were associated higher muscle activity levels of the upper trapezius and anterior deltoid. Biceps muscle activity was greatest during teat dip and wipe. Forearm flexor and extensor muscle activity was greatest during teat wipe and dip. The TS system resulted in more desirable anterior deltoid EMG profiles, and less desirable biceps, forearm flexor and extensor profiles. Conclusions: Results suggest that the TS system is effective in reducing anterior deltoid muscle activation levels. The TS system also appears to result in increased biceps, forearm flexor and extensor muscle activation levels. Increases in muscle activation levels could be offset by reduced repetitiveness resulting from three conventional manual milking tasks being replaced with one TS task. Relevance to industry: If parlor production requirements (e.g., quality and onsistency) are maintained while simultaneously reducing cumulative muscle loading and worker fatigue, then TS use should be considered in milking parlor operations.

However, few studies have used nonlinear methods to analyze HRV in order to determine the level of physical fatigue experienced by construction workers. As a result, to identify and categorize physical fatigue in construction workers, the current study examined the linear and nonlinear approaches of HRV analysis. Fifteen healthy construction workers (mean age, 33.2 +/- 6.9 years) were selected for this study. A textile-based wearable sensor monitored each participant's HRV after they completed 60 min of bar bending and fixing tasks. At baseline, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min into the task, participants were given the Borg-20 to measure their subjective levels of physical fatigue. Nonlinear [e.g., R-R interval (RRI) variability, entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis] and linear (e.g., time- and frequency-domain) HRV parameters were extracted. Five machine learning classifiers were used to identify and discern different physical fatigue levels. The accuracy and validity of the classifier models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The classification models were developed by either combining or individualized HRV features derived from linear and nonlinear HRV analyses. In the individualized feature sets, time-domain features had the highest classification accuracy (92%) based on the random forest (RF) classifier. The combined feature (i.e., the time-domain and nonlinear features) sets showed the highest classification accuracy (93.5%) using the RF classifier. In conclusion, this study showed that both linear and nonlinear HRV analyses can be used to detect and classify physical fatigue in construction workers. This research offers important contributions to the industry by analyzing the variations in linear and nonlinear HRV parameters in response to construction tasks. This study demonstrates that HRV values changed significantly in response to physical work, indicating a change in the relative activity of cardiac autonomic functions as a result of fatigue. Using the ways in which HRV parameters vary in response to increased workloads provides a sensitive marker for contrasting construction workers with and without cardiovascular disease. It also allows the site manager to track how quickly workers fatigue, so that they can switch up their workload to reduce the likelihood that any one worker would get severely exhausted, or to suggest that workers who are already severely fatigued take a break to prevent further injury.

The growing demand to protect, exploit and learn about some of our most precious resources calls for particular knowledge and skills to respond to the challenges of a harsh and unforgiving environment. The new Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree (EMJMD) Programme in Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR) (http://www.master- mir.eu) combines robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance marine and maritime science and its technological applications. It aims at building the capacity to enable advances in far reaching sea exploration, autonomous deep sea robots, teleoperations and the use of AI in these endeavours. The MIR programme is shaped to provide training in data science and state of the art applied robotics targeted at enhancing the efficiency, health, safety and environmental performance of the offshore industry and maritime operations. The EMJMD MIR programme offers competitive scholarships to welcome students worldwide and provides them with a common space to develop their shared passion for marine robotics and AI. The programme fosters cultural exchange and sharing of individual experiences. The master's is conducted by a consortium of 4 well-established academic institutions in the domain of marine robotics research. The institutions are in 4 countries France (UTLN), Norway (NTNU), Portugal (UL-IST) and Spain (UJI), for which the ocean has played a key role in history and is anchored in society. The goal of the programme is to develop specialists in marine and maritime intelligent robotic systems, providing them with: a) a solid theoretical background in the marine physical processes and technical skills in robotics engineering control systems and sensors, b) grounded knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, enabling them to develop cutting edge robotics solutions to real world challenges, c) applied knowledge in subsea and maritime application fields, including blue growth of maritime and offshore sectors, as well as deep sea surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, subsea resources exploration, offshore structure maintenance, e-navigation and maritime security enhancement. Students completing the MIR Masters will be well equipped with skills and state of the art knowledge, enabling them to pursue a career in robotics engineering for the offshore oil and gas, renewable, naval, and maritime sectors. Additionally, the knowledge acquired in the use and function of intelligent robotics for the underwater environment will enable them to easily continue on to a PhD in multiple different fields, should they so desire. The programme was designed to address global challenges identified by the consortium, the gap between industry and academia, the slow convergence of AI and robotics communities and the geopolitical and cultural differences among participating countries. The MIR programme contains a growing worldwide network of more than 58 academic and industrial associate partners spanning more than 21 countries and covering all oceans. Associate partners participate by providing industry-led lectures, internships, research collaborations and scholarships. Learning-by-doing courses cover the fundamentals of the marine environment, robotics and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the interconnections between these fields. A set of transversal skills is developed through courses in languages, scientific writing and entrepreneurship. Furthermore. the MIR consortium organises a yearly symposium hosting presentations from the students' work, keynotes from distinguished scholars, industry representatives and competitive challenges in AI and robotics. While the first year of the course takes place at UTLN, each student specialises in one of the three study tracks, encompassing a 3rd semester at one of the other main partners' institutions. Applied robotics for underwater intervention missions (UJI) aims to endow underwater robots with the capability to interact with the environment using manipulators, thus paving the way for the development of advanced systems for close-range underwater infrastructures inspection and maintenance as well as materials sampling. Safe Autonomous subsea operations (NTNU) targets increasing the level of automation and autonomy in routine or otherwise tedious operations which can improve safety, efficiency and performance, supporting the human operator in decisionmaking and supervision and reducing human workload. Cooperative marine robotics for scientific and commercial applications (IST-UL) focuses on groups of autonomous marine robots working in cooperation, networked via aerial, acoustic, and optical links to dramatically improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales. MIR students write a master thesis related to their study track and supervised by one of the main partners and their work is presented at the MIR annual symposium. Graduates receive a double diploma from UTLN and the institution of their study track. The MIR programme fills a gap in the current EU education landscape by responding to a pressing demand for specialists in ocean technology. It does so by building a consortium of actors around the globe with the common goal of advancing education and research in AI and robotics for ocean applications.","[Marxer, Ricard; Hugel, Vincent; Pediaditi Prud'homme, Kalliopi] Univ Toulon & Var, Toulon, France; [Batista, Pedro; Pascoal, Antonio] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal; [Marti Aviles, Jose Vicente; Sanz, Pedro J.] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Schjolberg, Ingrid] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Universite de Toulon; Universidade de Lisboa; Universitat Jaume I; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Marxer, R (corresponding author), Univ Toulon & Var, Toulon, France.",marxer@univ-tln.fr,"Sanz, Pedro/K-5639-2016; Marxer, Ricard/D-1047-2017; PASCOAL, ANTÓNIO/N-4791-2017; Batista, Pedro/A-3074-2011",,Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union; EMJMD scholarship; ECA,Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union(Erasmus+); EMJMD scholarship; ECA,Co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.
