The degree of variant diversity increasesalongthe value chain. Hence, assembly is forced to deal with the highest diversity. These fluctuating workloads affect the utilization rate in multi model assembly lines. Thereby, constant cycle times lead to losses in time due to the model mix. Furthermore, losses can result from gaps between exact workloads and human capacities in the workstations.Optimal operating points are defined as the ideal combination of concurrent sub goals like utilization rate and throughput rate. The identification of such operating points for assembly lines with planned product sequences shows up as a task for capacity planning and line balancing. Several analytic line balancing methods were developed in the past aiming for instance at minimal cycle times. However, methods for operational decisions on cycle time and overall production capacity are still rare. Simulation methods show potential to fill this gap. They allow the modeling and simulation of specific and complex production systems. This paper describes a planning method and a simulative tool for the identification of optimal operation points. The aim of optimal operating points is a reduction of time losses due to the model mix.Based oncurrent approaches for simulative line balancing, a planning tool has been developed. Working with defined product sequences, thistool supports the variation of parameters like the cycle time. Effects on productivity and time losses can be analyzed. Optimal operating points can be identified. Furthermore, the tool can visualize specific product sequences with corresponding workloads during the shift. It supports staff decisions on improvements in production. Moreover, results can be used for decisions on staff planning and staff development. The tool has been validated by a case study in a truck assembly line.",

Simultaneously, in alignment with the Industry 5.0 paradigm, understanding the influence of digital technologies on human workers, especially those directly interacting with these technologies, is equally critical. This study focuses on augmented reality (AR) as a specific technology, conducting an experimental campaign to explore its effects on learning curves and cognitive workload. Voluntary participants engaged in learning manual tasks of varying durations and required dexterity. This study evaluates the impact of AR on the mental workload of operators, utilising two main eye-related measures: fixation duration and pupil diameter.

Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload.",

However, a takeover request (TOR) to the driver remains essential for emergencies and safety–critical scenarios beyond automation's capability. Thus, accessing drivers’ safety performance in various TOR scenarios is crucial for conditionally automated driving (SAE L3). However, TOR safety performance is seldom examined concerning drivers' cognitive load, despite its presumed relevance to TOR scenarios and human–machine interaction. Moreover, the adequacy of the time window preceding a TOR, critical for TOR safety prediction, remains inadequately explored. This study aims to assess safety performance across diverse TOR scenarios in Level 3 conditional automation, incorporating drivers’ cognitive load, and predict TOR safety by considering the time window's impact. A driving simulator experiment gathered eye movement and driving behavior data from 37 recruited participants. Participants were instructed to take control of the vehicle from automated driving within a time budget (TB) of 3 s or 7 s in obstacle avoidance (OA) or lane keeping (LK) scenarios while engaging in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). Participants’ subjective cognitive load in the different TOR scenarios was scaled using NASA-TLX. Furthermore, safe TOR performance was predicted utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) across different time window sizes preceding a TOR. The results indicate that: 1) cognitive loads in takeover scenarios ranked from highest to lowest as TB = 3s_OA, TB = 3s_LK, TB = 7s_OA, TB = 7s_LK; and the cognitive loads of the NDRTs ranked from highest to lowest as mistake finding, texting, chatting, monitoring; 2) the takeover safety performance in the four scenarios from lowest to highest was TB = 3s_OA, TB = 3s_LK, TB = 7s_OA, TB = 7s_LK; likewise, the takeover safety performance during the four NDRTs ranked from lowest to highest as mistake finding, monitoring, texting, chatting; 3) the time window size before the TORs significantly affected the prediction performance of the model. A 30-second window was recommended as optimal for predicting takeover safety using the CNN model, achieving an average F1 score of 0.8120 and 81.98 % accuracy. This study's findings enhance our comprehension of driving behavior characteristics during TOR and offer valuable insights for detecting driver states in conditionally automated driving contexts.",

This emerging technology introduced novel human-computer interaction paradigms that would have impact on pilot's cognitive demands. The objective of this research was to evaluate both the pilot's perceived workload and SA while interacting with an AR device using different interactive modes. Participants performed traditional landing checklists as a baseline to compare with the AR gesture-command and voice-command checklists. The research results showed that gesture-commands created additional cognitive and physical demands. Conversely, voice-command checklists could constitute a significant improvement in terms of reducing participants' perceived workload and maximising SA performance. The findings provided evidence that the interactive modes of AR user interface design could influence participant's cognitive information processing and perceived workload in flight operations. However, there were some limitations with AR applications that included latency on response time, narrow field of view, accuracy of voice recognition, calibration within dynamic environment and inexplicable movements of the head position that required further investigation. An AR device can be a great tool for training at the initial stage to increase cost-efficiency in flight operations. Furthermore, the implementation of an AR design may provide part of the potential solution for single pilot operations in the future.",

For this reason, it has been widely embraced in various industrial fields, especially for helping operators assemble products. Despite its widespread adoption, there is a debate in the research community about how effective AR is for improving user performance in assembly tasks, particularly when using handheld devices. These disparities can be attributed to differences in experimental approaches, such as the frequent use of qualitative methods, the inclusion of non-representative users, and the limited number of comprehensive case studies. In response to this, the paper delved into the benefits of AR applications, with a specific focus on measuring user performance and the cognitive workload perceived by users during assembly activities. To this end, an AR assembly guidance tool has been developed to assist users during assembly tasks, running on a mobile device, specifically a tablet, for freedom of movement and high portability. Experimentation involved the assembly of a comprehensive case study and a diverse user group, allowing the comparison representative users and experienced industrial operators. The results were promising, indicating that AR technology effectively enhances user performance during assembly-guided activities compared to conventional methods, particularly when users are unfamiliar with the task at hand. This study brings valuable insights by addressing previous research limitations and providing strong evidence of AR's positive impact on user performance in real-world assembly scenarios.",

For such a problem, we present a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that linearizes and incorporates into the SALBP the Occupational Repetitive Action (OCRA). This well-known method gives ergonomic risk indicators for musculoskeletal disorders. A lexicographical approach to address the problem is proposed, where the minimum number of stations is obtained for SALBP and used as a starting point to solve a type-F ErgoSALBP (feasibility problem) focused on satisfying the maximum ergonomic risk workload. Once the exact solution is found, we establish an objective function to smooth the ergonomic risk distribution among stations. We tested a total of 2160 instances with up to 297 tasks. Our method was able to solve 94% of all instances optimally. The share of solutions found with only green stations (the ideal ergonomic condition) was 87%, surpassing the state of the art. For the instances where the model did not converge to a solution within the time limit, we present a procedure to assess the optimality gap. Furthermore, the model can be embedded as a building block for other assembly line configurations. Finally, the results provide trade-off insights for managers: the average OCRA for the line improves as the cycle time increases, which may positively impact workers’ satisfaction and product quality in the long run.",

Reconfiguration of this line is a major practice in industry, which is known as two-sided assembly line balancing problem of type-II. To solve this NP-hard problem, this paper proposes an improved discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm via blending idle time reduction techniques. The cycle time compression mechanism speeds up the search process by reducing total idle times to a larger extent on earlier iterations. Task assignment rule is specifically designed to eliminate sequence-dependent idle times. The overload and underload are taken into account as a secondary objective to reduce the remaining idle times. To achieve a fine balance between the diversification and intensification, the employed bees in the DABC algorithm generate new food sources by combining the features of two solutions, and the onlookers expand the search space with the variable neighborhood search. Nine recent meta-heuristics including a simulated annealing algorithm and an ant colony optimization algorithm are also extended for the TALBP-II to test the performance of the proposed DABC algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the nine compared algorithms and find 22 brand-new results for large-size problems.",

To tease apart the cognitive and motor components of task performance, we included two additional conditions: a condition where participants only used their eyes to perform the CTT task (using an eye tracking device), incurring reduced motor demands, and a condition where participants manually tracked visually-cued targets without numbers on them, incurring reduced cognitive demands. Our results from a group of 30 older adults (>65) showed that reducing cognitive demands shortened completion times more extensively than reducing motor demands. Conditions with higher cognitive demands had longer target search time, as well as decreased movement execution velocity and head-hand coordination. We found larger pupil sizes in the more cognitively demanding conditions, and an inverse correlation between pupil size and completion times across individuals in all task conditions. Lastly, we found a possible link between VR-CTT performance measures and clinical signatures of participants (fallers versus non-fallers). In summary, performance and pupil parameters were mainly dependent on task cognitive load, while maintaining systematic interindividual differences. We suggest that this paradigm opens the possibility for more detailed profiling of individual cognitive-motor performance capabilities in older adults and other at-risk populations.",

An excessive workload can lead to fatigue or accidents, while an insufficient workload may diminish situational awareness and efficiency. However, existing supervised learning-based methods for workload recognition are ineffective when dealing with imperfect input data, such as missing or noisy data, which is not practical in real applications. This study introduces a robust Electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled cognitive workload recognition model using self-supervised learning. The proposed method, DMAEEG, combines the training strategies of denoising autoencoders and masked autoencoders, demonstrating strong robustness against noisy and incomplete data. More specifically, we adopt the temporal convolutional network and multi-head self-attention mechanisms as the backbone, effectively capturing both the temporal and spatial features from EEG. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on an open dataset and a self-collected dataset. The results indicate that DMAEEG performs superior to other state-of-the-art across various evaluation metrics. Moreover, DMAEEG maintains high accuracy in workload inference even when EEG signals are corrupted with a high masking ratio or strong noises. This signifies its superiority in capturing robust intrinsic patterns from imperfect EEG data. The proposed method significantly contributes to decoding EEG signals for workload recognition in real-world applications, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of human-automation interactions.",

As a result many manufacturing companies face an increasing variety of their product range. As it is not profitable to install new assembly lines for each product, assembly lines have to be able to handle different products in batch size one. In literature these lines are called mixed-model lines. They follow the logical principal of flow production but are capable of producing different products while needing minimal modification of assembly processes at the workstations. While mixed-model lines help manufacturing companies handling product differences profitably, they result in a number of challenges for the production process. One major challenge is related to the varying assembly times at a single workstation due to different products. Actions have to be taken to cope with assembly time that is over cycle time, in order to avoid stops in a flow production. For economical reasons manufacturing companies have to be able to work at a high workload utilization on average. Therefore it is necessary to have a detailed look at the workstations’ situation regarding production time variety. To address this, an analytical framework for assembly lines, based on a mixed-model line principle, is given to identify workstations that face high complexity regarding production time variety. This analytical framework contains several aspects focusing on production time variety as drifting probability, utilization and statistical dispersion. By using this framework, companies can apply their actions and line balancing more precisely to the situation at a workstation. Thus, manufacturing companies are able to handle complexity effectively and to reach a high workload utilization in their mixed-model assembly line.",

Some researchers explored the task assignment plan for the assembly line balancing problem with the assumption that the assembly process is smooth with no disruption. Other researchers considered the impacts of disruptions, but they only explored the task re-assignment solutions for the assembly line re-balancing problem with the assumption that the re-balancing decision has been made already. There is limited literature exploring on-line adjustment solutions (layout adjustment and production rate adjustment) for an assembly line in a dynamic environment. This is because real-time monitoring of an assembly process was impossible in the past, and it is difficult to incorporate uncertainty factors into the balancing process because of the randomness and non-linearity of these factors. However, Industry 4.0 breaks the information barriers between different parts of an assembly line, since smart, connected products, which are enabled by advanced information and communication technology, can intelligently interact and communicate with each other and collect, process and produce information. Smart control of an assembly line becomes possible with the large amounts of real-time production data in the era of Industry 4.0, but there is little literature considering this new context. In this study, a fuzzy control system is developed to analyze the real-time information of an assembly line, with two types of fuzzy controllers in the fuzzy system. Type 1 fuzzy controller is used to determine whether the assembly line should be re-balanced to satisfy the demand, and type 2 fuzzy controller is used to adjust the production rate of each workstation in time to eliminate blockage and starvation, and increase the utilization of machines. Compared with three assembly lines without the proposed fuzzy control system, the assembly line with the fuzzy control system performs better, in terms of blockage ratio, starvation ratio and buffer level. Additionally, with the improvement of information transparency, the performance of an assembly line will be better. The research findings shed light on the smart control of the assembly process, and provide insights into the impacts of Industry 4.0 on assembly line balancing.",

Nevertheless, allowing changes to customer-specific product configurations until late steps into the final assembly can be a competitive advantage as long as the negative effects on the assembly line can be mitigated. This paper proposes a method to efficiently handle such configuration changes while keeping the disruption of the assembly line as minimal as possible. The method assesses the criticality of change requests based on their severity and the assembly progress of the product. Based on this categorization an optimal time slot during the assembly process is identified to perform any additional work associated with a change request. These additional work contents can occur from necessary disassembly and different or additional assembly processes. The validation of the method for a final assembly line of large and complex products showed that it can reduce the additional workload by 26 % and the prolongation of the throughput time by 78 % on average.",

Despite the rapid progress made in the field, complete automation is not always possible. Often robots cannot replace workers’ flexibility, and sometimes there is no economically viable option for automation. A combined production system with both manual and automated parts could be the best configuration in such circumstances. Even with partial automation the number of workers in the line could be decreased, and workers’ safety and health conditions could be dramatically improved. In this paper, MILP models are suggested to compare the total workload of workers when different numbers of robots are applied in an assembly line with partial automation and the minimum possible number of workers. The proposed MILP model is implemented in the AIMMS modelling environment and solved using CPLEX. The presented models can help evaluate the impact of adding robots to the line on total workers’ workload and may assist decision makers in finding the best possible line configuration.",10

This paper presents a theoretical framework, which provides a systematic approach for measuring mental workload using a combination of analytical and empirical techniques: human performance modeling with a computer simulation and mathematical modeling, along with physiological, subjective and performance measures. For this study, the Air Force MATB, which is a re-development of the NASA simulation tool, was used to model multitasking in a controlled environment to validate the theoretical framework. The independent variable of task complexity was measured, in the modeling of resource demands for a cleaning-inspection process and a final inspection process, using three dependent variables (subjective, physiological and performance measures) with a total of four responses (NASA-TLX, Workload Profile, fixation duration and human error probability). The results indicate no significant difference among the response variables for each task complexity level, indicating the model accurately represents the operator's workload. Additional analysis shows accurate predication from the model in analyzing workload peaks. Relevance to industry This theoretical framework is designed to evaluate operator mental workload utilization in the manufacturing domain. This is important because manufacturing work is changing by requiring more multitasking roles, which increases cognitive demand. Therefore, the industry needs models that can predict operator performance and mental workload for improved productivity.",

Despite the high level of automation achieved in production systems, flexibility is often provided by human dexterity and the cognitive capabilities of the workforce, as in assembly lines. In the case of repetitive manual tasks, workers are exposed to the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In these contexts, a high production rate leads to high physical workload, and job rotation is adopted in order to reduce the ergonomic risk. Traditionally, ergonomics and human performance issues have been investigated separately. However, in the design and scheduling of human-based manufacturing systems, a reliable description of human components is required in order to jointly evaluate production system performance and assess workers׳ risk of MSDs In this paper, the authors propose a model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is a mixed integer programming model allowing for the maximization of production rate jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. Risk and its acceptability are evaluated using the OCRA (OCcupational Repetitive Actions) method (ISO 11228-3:2007), widely recognized as an effective tool for the risk assessment of Upper Limb Work related MSDs (UL-WMSDs). Moreover, the different workers׳ performance due to their respective training levels and skills is considered in the problem formulation. The model is applied to an industrial case study. Results show the model׳s capacity to identify optimal job rotation schedules jointly achieving productivity and ergonomic risk goals.

Since reduced cognitive load ensures that pilots will operate the aircraft safely and effectively, it is critical to evaluate pilot cognitive load during HMI. A cognitive load assessment method, based on multi-criteria decision-making, is proposed to accurately quantify the relationship between the HMI and the cognitive load in the fighter’s cockpit. Firstly, based on the integrated Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and MEthod based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC) methods are used to assign subjective and objective weights, respectively. Moreover, the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method is applied to rank the scenarios to establish a cognitive load assessment model for the cockpit HMI of the fighter jet. Secondly, an evaluation standard system of fighter cockpit HMI is proposed, drawn upon multiple sets of eye-movement criteria and subjective assessment criteria. Moreover, cognitive load experiments of fighter cockpit HMI are conducted using eye-tracking technology to get the objective physiological cognitive data as well as the subjective assessment data of the subjects. Consequently, the parameter data sets of the eye-movement criteria and the subjective criteria for the evaluation of cognitive load are obtained. The proposed method is applied to analyze the cognitive load assessment of a fighter jet cockpit HMI layout. This application aims to verify the effectiveness of the assessment method in evaluating the cognitive load of the HMI layout. Through sensitivity and comparison analyses, the model was further verified to have excellent robustness and applicability for cognitive load assessment. The advantages of this method can be seen through the comparison, which is that it has higher discriminability when assessing the degree of cognitive load. At the same time, it has higher flexibility in dealing with complex and ambiguous cognitive load assessment information.",

Human error may be considered as a result of additional supplementary tasks on top of an accustomed workload. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of workload on human performance. To achieve this, a TRANSAS simulator series 5000 was used to replicate a real scenario with the addition of workload as a PSF. Each participant engaged in a fault detection and correction task. 20 participants were used for the workload study; all 20 were trained for 3 h to use the engine room software interface. The participants then completed a 30-min ballasting task. During this interaction, 50% of the participants underwent a simulated scenario where the workload was increased. The other 50% were given a standard task. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure the participant's activation levels, more specifically from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of the cerebrum. The results showed an increase in activation of the DLPFC during each phase of the task, this trend was magnified by the addition of increased workload. The results are discussed with respect to human performance during varying workload. From the results of this study, a human classification performance model was developed.

After the simulation, a flight instructor used a standardized method to evaluate student pilot's individual cognitive workload from video-recorded flight simulator data. Results indicated that HRV was able to differentiate flight phases that induced varying levels of cognitive workload; an increasing level of cognitive workload caused significant decreases in many HRV variables, mainly reflecting parasympathetic deactivation of cardiac autonomic regulation.

These functions are the basis of models that describe human behavior and neural mechanisms for diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and stroke-related cognitive dysfunction. Such models can enhance our understanding of the disease processes and enable crucial applications like predicting cognitive trajectories for early diagnosis. However, despite the success of these models in predicting early-stage cognitive impairment and decline, their practical use is limited in clinics because most of the models focus on utilizing one or two factors of the neurophysiological activation to achieve prediction. Still, little is known about the mechanisms through which the task difficulty and cognitive demands affect the expression of neurophysiological activation and whether there is an expression difference under cognitive task demands. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive examination of the neurophysiological expression difference and mechanisms under various cognitive loads. We designed an experimental protocol and developed a data processing framework to explicitly examine brain activity and eye movement under various levels of cognitive task difficulty and find that (1) eye movement is a readout of cognitive processes, but it is a joint function of task difficulty, brain activity, and skin conductance; (2) brain activity has specific patterns related to the various levels of cognitive load and exerts its influence on predicting the dynamics of cognitive processes. These findings suggest that neuroimaging studies comparing task-related neurophysiological activation must be examined and interpreted in a holistic view of neural mechanisms.",

Contrary to the existing literature on workload smoothing in ALB, which often treats the optimization of a prespecified smoothness index as a secondary objective, we consider our SX-objective as the single one in order to account for the practical relevance of fair workload distributions and avoiding overloaded bottleneck stations. To optimally solve SALBP-SX, we develop a tailored branch-and-bound procedure. It contains a new station-oriented branching scheme, new lower bound arguments, logical tests and, in particular, a dynamic programming scheme for the pre-calculation of potential workloads, which accelerates the procedure greatly.

Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner.

The unpaced variant of these lines employs a conveyor to discretely move pieces between stations either synchronously or asynchronously. Workload balancing and product sequencing are common optimization problems associated with these lines. While many works detail balancing and sequencing separately, few explicitly combine these degrees of freedom. Furthermore, hybrid (i.e. partly synchronous and partly asynchronous) lines are not explicitly described by previous optimization models. This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming model capable of representing such unpaced lines and explicitly combine balancing, sequencing and cyclical scheduling. The application of the proposed method to a new dataset demonstrates the advantages of simultaneously balancing and sequencing lines, generating more efficient solutions than previously described models for 238 out of 240 instances. These results implied, however, in greater computational costs required to combine the degrees of freedom. Furthermore, a direct performance comparison study between synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid lines is conducted. This allows line designers and managers to explicitly evaluate economical trade-offs between these line types.",

Strategies such as optimized break time planning, line balancing, procedure modifications, and improved training are proposed to ensure both employee well-being and stakeholder benefits. This framework indirectly supports the industry’s efforts to address the looming challenge of unfilled jobs by fostering a supportive work environment that enhances job satisfaction, potentially making positions more appealing and retaining valuable talent.

In this paper, we extend and improve the branch-and-bound procedure SALSA (Simple Assembly Line Smoothing Algorithm) of Walter et al.

Like SALSA, it is based on a dynamic programming scheme which pre-determines potential workloads of the stations and provides a construction plan for possible station loads. This scheme is extended by the new concept of supporters and preventers which significantly enhances branching, bounding, and logical tests. Furthermore, a tailored heuristic that searches for improved initial solutions, a bidirectional branching scheme and additional dominance rules are integrated.

Nowadays, assembly lines have to face the manufacturing of extremely personalized products (e.g. cars) as requested by an increasingly higher portion of the market demand. Several literature contributions focus on different balancing problems affected by the wide variety of the final product, e.g. mixed and multi model assembly lines. However, no contribution seems to tackle the personalized production of goods. Such products require to assemble a certain number of tasks whatever the final product personalization is, and a variable number of optional of different type determined by the specifications of every single costumer. This paper faces the generalized assembly of personalized goods proposing an innovative two step methodology to optimize the workload balancing between the assembly line stations, considering traditional tasks and the optional required by the product personalization, which could occur with different frequencies and pairings. The first phase of the developed methodology executes a clustering of product options required by the costumers based on a similarity index. This phase leads to the definition of several sets of optional typically requested together by the customer and with similar mounting time. The methodology second phase leverages the defined clusters of optional. Indeed, optional of the same cluster shouldn’t be assigned to the same workstation to reduce the overload or underload of the assembly operators. An integer programming model is proposed to assign both traditional tasks and optional to stations, to maximize the assembly line balancing considering the order frequency and assembly time of the clusterized optional. An industrial case study is adopted to test and validate the proposed two steps methodology. The obtained results highlight a consistent time balancing between assembly line workstations and a significant limitation of the operator overloads.",2

Thus, the aims of this study are: i) to evaluate the impact of a five-day survival at sea simulation on human adaptive capacities, based on the assessment of psychological, cognitive, physiological, and sensorial measures; and ii) to assess recovery. Twenty-one healthy participants were enrolled in a 5-day simulation onboard a lifeboat or an inflatable raft. Psychological, physiological, sensory, and cognitive measurements were recorded before leaving (baseline), at the end of the experiment (post) and during the week that followed (recovery). Our results are unequivocal. The harshness of the environment affected the majority of the organism's responses. On the cognitive level, performance significantly deteriorated. On the psychological level, there was low mood, a decrease in subjective exteroceptive acuity and sleep disorders, increased energy, and less perceived stress. On the physiological level, a decline was recorded with respect to autonomous nervous system measurements. On the sensory level, we observed a state of hypervigilance and hypersensitivity to stimuli from the external environment. Proprioception was deeply impacted. Moreover, at recovery, many individuals did not fully recover or deteriorated further, especially regarding sleep, interoceptive abilities and sensory distortion. It appears that participants entered a state of psychological hibernation, associated with increased physical and cognitive load, and sensory hypervigilance.

However, the initial balance can be broken by the changing processing abilities of machines because of machine degradation, and at some point, re-balancing of the line is inevitable. Nevertheless, the impacts of unexpected events on assembly line re-balancing are always ignored. With the advanced sensor technologies and Internet of Things, the machine degradation process can be monitored continuously, and condition-based maintenance can be implemented to improve the health state of each machine. With the technology of robotic process automation, workflows of the assembly process can be smoothed and workstations can work autonomously together. A higher level of process automation can be achieved. Real-time information of the processing abilities of machines will bring new opportunities for automated workload balance via adaptive decision-making. In this study, a fuzzy control system is developed to make real-time decisions to balance the workloads based on the processing abilities of workstations, given the policy of condition-based maintenance. Fuzzy controllers are used to decide whether to re-balance the assembly line and how to adjust the production rate of each workstation. The numerical experiments show that the buffer level of the assembly line with the proposed fuzzy control system is lower than that of the assembly line without any control system and the buffer level of the assembly line with another control system is the lowest. The demand can always be satisfied by assembly lines except the one with another control system since there is too much production loss sacrificed for the low buffer level. The sensitivity analysis of the control performance to the parameter settings is also conducted. Thus, the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy control system is demonstrated, and intelligent automation can improve the performance of the assembly process by the fuzzy control system since real-time information of the assembly line can be used for adaptive decision-making.",

Publicly available datasets are scarce, making it difficult to establish new approaches and comparative studies. In this work, COLET-COgnitive workLoad estimation based on Eye-Tracking dataset is presented. Methods: Forty-seven (47) individuals’ eye movements were monitored as they solved puzzles involving visual search activities of varying complexity and duration. The participants’ cognitive workload level was evaluated with the subjective test of NASA-TLX and this score is used as an annotation of the activity. Extensive data analysis was performed in order to derive eye and gaze features from low-level eye recorded metrics, and a range of machine learning models were evaluated and tested regarding the estimation of the cognitive workload level. Results: The activities induced four different levels of cognitive workload. Multi tasking and time pressure have induced a higher level of cognitive workload than the one induced by single tasking and absence of time pressure. Multi tasking had a significant effect on 17 eye features while time pressure had a significant effect on 7 eye features. Both binary and multi-class identification attempts were performed by testing a variety of well-known classifiers, resulting in encouraging results towards cognitive workload levels estimation, with up to 88% correct predictions between low and high cognitive workload. Conclusions: Machine learning analysis demonstrated potential in discriminating cognitive workload levels using only eye-tracking characteristics. The proposed dataset includes a much higher sample size and a wider spectrum of eye and gaze metrics than other similar datasets, allowing for the examination of their relations with various cognitive states.",

This paper presents an integrated Augmented Reality (AR) solution developed to assist manual inspection tasks in the supporting areas of semiconductor manufacturing, referred to as the sub-fab. The solution is accessible to a human worker wearing an AR headset during the inspection process at the location. We propose a system framework to deploy computational intelligences of varying granularity provided by the solution across cloud, edge, and device levels, accommodating constraints within the sub-fab. A machine maintenance module helps estimate and monitor the health condition of running scrubbers. Incorrect intentions performed by the worker on the scrubber control panel are detected through hand gesture recognition. This instantly prompts warning messages in the AR headset to prevent subsequent wrong actions. The solution can also identify abnormal device states through 6D pose estimation of objects enabled by machine learning models.

Considering the current situation, the cycle time from 170 s has been reduced to 142.25 s, and the line efficiency has been increased from 82.36% to 98.42%. There was no increase or decrease in the number of stations on the line and the number of operators working there. As a result of all these efforts, the workload was distributed equally among the stations, severely reducing waiting time. In this way, the downtimes in production were reduced, the overtime hours required to reach the required daily production amount were eliminated, and labor costs were reduced.",3

Making the boundaries of acceptable performance visually perceivable should elicit skill-based behavior, thus lowering the cognitive load. To illustrate the psychological mechanisms of ecological interface design and validate its influence on cognitive load, we compared a conventional speedometer to an ecological speedometer. Both interfaces were displayed on the head-up display of a static driving simulator and were tested in a rural highway scenario. In a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated-measure design, the human–machine interface was tested along with the informative intelligent speed assistance system (representing an existing alternative for speed control) and the additional workload induced by a 1-back task (representing cognitively demanding driving situations). To measure cognitive load, we used a tactile version of the detection response task and controlled for all confounding variables. The experiment was conducted with 28 male and 21 female drivers. Our hypotheses and the ecological interface design theory are supported by the finding that the ecological speedometer reduces the use of cognitive resources. Moreover, the specific application of the ecological speedometer enables better driving performance (i.e., longitudinal and lateral control) compared to a conventional speedometer.",

Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks.",

A mixed reality (MR) integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping framework for immersive and intuitive telemanipulation of a complex mobile manipulator is presented. The proposed 3D immersive telerobotic schemes provide the users with depth perception through the merging of multiple 3D/2D views of the remote environment via MR subspace. The mobile manipulator platform consists of a 6°-of-freedom (DOF) industrial manipulator, 3D-printed parallel gripper, and mobile base, which can be controlled by non-skilled operators who are physically separated from the robot working space through a velocity-based imitative motion mapping approach. This work evaluates the impact of depth perception and immersion provided by integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes on teleoperation efficiency and user experience in an MR environment. In particular, the MR enhanced systems maintain spatial awareness and perceptual salience of the remote scene in 3D, facilitating intuitive mixed reality human-robot interaction (MR-HRI). This study compared two MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes against a typical 2D Baseline visual display method through pick-and-place, assembly, and dexterous manufacturing tasks. The MR-integrated 3D/2D vision and motion mapping schemes of teleoperation reduced overall task completion times by 34% and 17%, compared to the MR-2D Baseline, while minimizing training effort and cognitive workload.",

Most industrial accidents occur today due to human error. For safe and efficient operation, it is therefore critical to ensure optimal operator performance. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and concomitant digitalization, the role of operators has become cognitively challenging. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the cognitive performance of operators. One of the major constructs to understand cognitive performance is the cognitive workload. An increase in cognitive workload often leads to degradation in performance. Traditional assessment techniques fail to capture cognitive aspects of performance. Recently, researchers in various domains such as aviation, driving, marine, and nuclear power have started to utilize physiological measures to gauge the cognitive workload of their operators. In our previous works, we have used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking separately to assess the cognitive workload of operators in the process industries. In contrast, in this paper, we explore the benefits of their fusion in classifying process industry control room operators’ workload into low, medium, and high classes while they tackle abnormal situations. The methodology employs the fusion of metrics derived from pupil, gaze, and EEG data to train a decision tree-based model for workload classification. Our results reveal that fusion leads to an increase in classification accuracy of upto 22 %. The work has the potential to identify the expertise level of operators and hence, can be critical in ensuring their optimal performance.",

However, there is no commonly accepted method to guide the practitioners in selecting the appropriate method and means to evaluate their task of interest. This paper goes a step further from the existing formal guidelines by considering aspects such as the stage of development of the manufacturing tasks and weighting the cognitive and physical aspects as per the task’s nature.

The MILP formulations, however, are not usually capable of solving large size problem instances. In this paper, the aim is to solve the WSLBP using mathematical programming formulations by using off-the-shelf solvers. Differently from the literature some non-MILP formulations are also considered for the problem. For this purpose, three MILP formulations, one from the literature, and two non-MILP formulations are compared.

Sharing the human-centric perspective and harmonious human–machine collaboration concepts emphasized by Industry 5.0, the design phase of a collaborative workstation must integrate both psychological and physical risk evaluations to provide a safe and inclusive work environment suitable for a diversified workforce. Accelerating the pre-deployment phase to quickly reconfigure workstation design and assess its impact on workload balancing and task sequencing during the deployment of assembly lines still represents a challenging task considering the available software tools. This research proposes a new mathematical model to accelerate the design of ergonomic human-robot collaborative workstations based on task alternatives and the combined consideration of postural assessment and fatigue analyses for each of them to design an ergo-friendly collaborative environment. Surface electromyography analysis is jointly adopted with postural risk assessment measured with inertial measurement units and developed by a digital ergonomic platform to determine the optimal workplace configuration for tools, equipment, and resources to promote physical well-being while considering station productivity. Experimental tests are performed to investigate arm muscles and postural risk assessment for different configurations of workstation design and collaborative human-robot job progression. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, and the advantages of the proposed approach compared to existing simulation software to quickly generate and assess alternative scenarios and find a trade-off between ergo-quality levels and system performance. The final discussion offers valuable information for decision-makers and practitioners to facilitate the integration of human factors throughout the early stages of ergo-friendly workspace design, while effectively managing the complexity generated by resource allocation and collaborative robots.",

Therefore, by systematically considering ERPs, spectral content and importantly their combination, this study aimed to examine whether concurrent changes in spectral content and ERPs could collectively serve as an index of cognitive workload during locomotion. Specifically, ERP and EEG biomarkers were assessed as participants performed a cognitive task under two levels of difficulty (easy or hard) and two conditions (seated or walking). Changes in attentional reserve and mental effort appeared to collectively index cognitive workload under varying demands due to changes in task difficulty or performance conditions.

Therefore, this paper addresses the time and space assembly line balancing problem with multi-manned workstations. Our model includes five kinds of constraints by considering task assignment, precedence, cycle time, sequencing and space constraints. Our aim is to minimize the total number of workstations and operators via a new MILP model and memetic ant colony system. The memetic ant algorithm uses a new solution generation method which integrates 16 heuristic rules to help each ant of the algorithm to effectively build a feasible solution. New pheromone release strategies, including deposition and evaporation, are employed to update the global pheromone quantity. Additionally, a new best solution update method does not retain the solution with minimum objective function but balances the workload of each operator.

Two different setup scenarios, based on typical hardware setups, are modeled and optimized. The major contribution is an efficient heuristic algorithm to optimize our suggested model, which provides near optimal solutions in fraction of the time required by a general optimization package.

Notably, the application of cognitive load theory holds significant prominence in this field. Efficient evaluation of cognitive load not only facilitates the optimization of resource management and task allocation, but is also the key to creating a fluent interactive experience. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and physiological measurement technologies, new methodologies have emerged to measure and understand cognitive load. This research introduces a system for HCI training and assessment. The system, through the development of digital memory paradigms, induces and verifies varying levels of cognitive load with precision, thereby providing data-driven insights for HCI design. Specifically, this study constructs an AI-assisted multimodal cognitive load assessment framework, integrating physiological data collected from Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye-tracking technologies. By extracting and analyzing 29 physiological features, including channel features, graph-theoretic features, and features pertaining to eyelid and iris movements, we propose an innovative multimodal recognition approach to classify cognitive load across individuals. The experimental results not only verified the validity of the method, but also revealed changes in physiological patterns at different levels of cognitive load. In particular, the significant potential of the fNIRS feature in band I. This discovery suggests that we can monitor and predict cognitive load with greater precision through physiological signals, hence optimizing the design of HCI systems to alleviate user strain, prevent information overload, and enhance the naturalness and intuitiveness of interaction.",

To provide a continuous estimation of the CW, we built a CW recognizer that maps human electroencephalograms (EEGs) to discrete CW levels with deep learning tools. However, the EEG distribution varies when humans perform different cognitive tasks. There is thus a question on the capacity for generalizing the CW recognizer across tasks. In this study, we examined the CW's performance when it was trained and tested on two EEG databases corresponding to different human-machine tasks. Methods A novel deep neural network-based EEG recognizer, dynamic residual network with attention mechanism (DRNA-Net), is proposed in the present study. By taking advantage of recurrent networks, the DRNA-Net further incorporates a self-attention mechanism in discovering robust EEG patterns across different cognitive tasks. Results We designed an experiment that applied a multidimensional N-back task to induce the CW that consists of visual and auditory memory tasks. We validated the cross-task generalization capability of the DRNA-Net based on the EEG features extracted from the N-back task and a public database. The results show that the DRNA-Net achieves classification accuracy and Macro-F1 values are 0.6055 and 0.6067, respectively. Conclusions The performance of the DRNA-Net indicates that it has a certain ability of cross-task cognitive workload classification, which outperforms several shallow learners and deep convolutional neural networks under various conditions of the feature subsets.",

Balancing the PCB assembly line is crucial for improving productivity to meet market demand, which means balancing the workload distributed among various assembly stations on the assembly line. However, the workload balancing depends on material-handling systems in production environments that facilitate the transportation of raw materials to the buffer storage of the assembly stations. In the PCB assembly system, the material handling is carried out using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This paper studies the assembly line balancing and AGV scheduling collectively because of their dependency on each other. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to balance the workload distribution among stations and schedule the AGVs. An existing intelligent platform of the real-life PCB industry is considered to solve this integrated problem with intelligent decisions. The platform includes three layers modules: physical layer, data management layer and application service layer. A novel genetic artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is proposed and embedded with an application service layer to optimize the current problem and give optimum solutions for the real-life physical layer. The proposed GABC algorithm incorporates the operators of the genetic algorithm (GA) i.e., crossover and mutation into the search process of the ABC algorithm. Additionally, the greedy selection feature is employed in GABC which significantly enhances the exploitation capabilities, leading to faster convergence, higher-quality solutions, and improved robustness. The performance of the proposed GABC algorithm is tested based on different parameters by comparing the results with GA, ABC and PSO algorithms. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed GABC algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms. Therefore, the yielded solutions in terms of prompt responses help managers to expedite the production through intelligent decision-making based on customer demands.",

Studies indicate that sub-optimal decisions occur when there is a mismatch between the demands of the process and the human's capability. This mismatch leads to high cognitive workload in human operators, often a precursor for poor performance. Recently, researchers in various safety critical domains (aviation, driving, marine, NPP, etc.) have started to explore the use of physiological measurements from humans to understand their cognitive workload and its effect. In this work, we evaluate the potential of EEG to measure cognitive workload of human operators in chemical process control room. We propose a single dry electrode EEG based methodology for identifying the similarities and mismatch between the operators’ mental model of the process and the actual process behaviour during abnormal situations. Our results reveal that SƟ(ω), the power spectral density of theta (ɵ) waves (frequency range 4–7 Hz) in the EEG signal has the potential to identify such mismatches. Results indicate that SƟ(ω) is positively correlated with workload and hence can be used for assessing the cognitive workload of operators in process industries.",

In an assembly line balancing problem, there is a massive amount of research in the literature assuming deterministic environment, and many other works consider uncertain task times. This research utilises the uncertainty theory to model uncertain demand and introduces complexity theory to measure the uncertainty of assembly lines. Scenario probability and triangular fuzzy number are used to describe the uncertain demand. The station complexity was measured based on information entropy and fuzzy entropy to assist in balancing systems with robust performances, considering the influence of multi-model products in the station on the assembly line. Taking minimum station complexity, minimum workload difference within station, maximum productivity as objective functions, a new optimization model for mixed-model assembly line balancing under uncertain demand was established. Then an improved genetic algorithm was applied to solve the model. Finally, the effectiveness of the model was verified by several instances of mixed-model assembly line for automobile engine.",

A reliable measurement of cognitive workload could allow for improvements in human machine interface designs and increase safety in several domains. At present, numerous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive workload, reporting the rise in cognitive workload to be associated with increases in theta band power and decreases in alpha band power. However, results have been inconsistent with some failing to reach the required level of significance. We hypothesized that the lack of consistency could be related to individual differences in task performance and/or to the small sample sizes in most EEG studies. In the present study we used EEG to assess the increase in cognitive workload occurring in a multitasking environment while taking into account differences in performance. Twenty participants completed a task commonly used in airline pilot recruitment, which included an increasing number of concurrent sub-tasks to be processed from one to four. Subjective ratings, performances scores, pupil size and EEG signals were recorded. Results showed that increases in EEG alpha and theta band power reflected increases in the involvement of cognitive resources for the completion of one to three subtasks in a multitasking environment. These values reached a ceiling when performances dropped. Consistent differences in levels of alpha and theta band power were associated to levels of task performance: highest performance was related to lowest band power.",

Vestel Electronics is a leading producer of washing machines and holds a noteworthy market position in the European consumer electronics industry. The production process at Vestel Electronics is make-to-order (MTO) and requires 20 assembly lines to produce 200 different products. The decision maker must consider several important factors while forming the production schedule, including job-assembly line compatibility, the release times and due dates of the jobs, and a workload balance among the different assembly lines. This study aims to develop an algorithm to minimize the total earliness and tardiness while considering sequence-and-machine-dependent setups, unequal release times, machine-job compatibility restrictions, and workload balance requirements. To address this complex scheduling problem, we propose a novel algorithm, the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), which has a strong exploration–exploitation balance while mimicking real-world dynamics. Our numerical results show that the ICA significantly outperforms the current practice in Vestel by 39% and the best-performing algorithms in the literature by 23% and 12%.",

This paper introduces a semantic model for workload categorization. The model takes as input, a set of multi-modal physiological measurements, and uses parallel processing, complex event processing, and rule-based modelling to categorize a series of workloads (resting, cognitive workload, and physical workload). The model has undergone a set of evaluations, including categorization accuracy, and performance.

This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation- reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems.

Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty.

In asynchronous lines blocking and starvation phenomena are responsible of performances deterioration. Three popular techniques able to limit these phenomena are: balancing the workload among stations by tasks assignment, allocating buffers between stations, optimizing of the sequence of models entering the line. These three techniques correspond to the Mixed-model Assembly Line Balancing Problem (MALBP), the buffer allocation problem (BAP) and the sequencing problem (SP). The presented approach is able to simultaneously solve these three problems, which are strictly connected, and is based on a Genetic Algorithm procedure that uses discrete event simulation to evaluate the fitness function of individuals.

The benefits of AR on industrial activities like assembly or maintenance have been investigated extensively, but the literature on AR-assisted quality control, specifically, quality inspection, is scarce. This stands in contrast to the importance of industrial quality inspection and highlights the need for research on the topic. In this work, we develop an AR-based system for head-mounted displays (HMDs) that visualizes product defects directly on physical products. We investigate its effect on task performance and human factors through an experiment. Participants performed multiple quality inspections using real manufacturing products and equipment with the help of an AR HMD, a screen, or no additional help. We find increased task performance using the AR HMD system. In comparison to screen-based assistance, a moderating effect of task difficulty was observed. Specifically, AR was more beneficial to task completion times given a difficult task. Furthermore, the AR HMD system reduced mental workload and received a positive rating regarding user experience. Our work contributes to the research in industrial AR usage through a novel AR HMD system for quality inspection and provides so far missing empirical and theoretically grounded evidence on its benefits with regard to task performance and human factors.",

Thus, it is crucial to understand the impact of different internal operator’s factors including eye movements, memory and audio-visual integration. Here, we explored the relationship between cognitive workload (low vs. high) and eye movements (saccades, fixations and smooth pursuit). The task difficulty was induced by auditory noise, arithmetical count and working memory load. We estimated cognitive workload using EOG and EEG-based mental state monitoring. One novelty consists in recording the EOG around the ears (alternative EOG) and around the eyes (conventional EOG). The number of blinks and saccades amplitude increased along with the difficulty increase (p ≤ 0.05). We found significant correlations between EOG and EEG (theta/alpha ratio) and between conventional and alternative EOG signal. The increase in cognitive load may disturb the coding and maintenance of related visual information. Alternative EOG metrics could be a valuable tool for detecting workload.",

This paper addresses the scheduling of a set of jobs in a paced assembly line in presence of uncertainty affecting the availability of production resources, stemming from the assembly process in the aircraft manufacturing industry. The production problem is modeled as a no-wait paced permutation flow shop and solved providing a robust scheduling solution minimizing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of the residual work content, i.e., the amount of workload that cannot be completed during the cycle time in the stations, due to a lack of available resources. A branch-and-bound approach is developed and applied to randomly generated instances as well as to an industrial problem related to the production of aircrafts.",

They are often used in manufacturing large sized products. In this paper, we proposed a bi-objective mathematical model to maximize the production rate and to distribute the workload of a two-sided assembly line with zone constraints. Harmony Search (HS) is proposed to solve and balance the problem. The HS uses the heuristic representation to encode the generated harmony element. Non-dominated sorting is implemented in the HS in order to obtain a set of diverse Pareto optimal solutions. Numerical examples are given to evaluate the proposed method. Comparison between the proposed HS and NSGA-II reveals that the proposed method has a better ratio and convergence for small and medium size problems, and has better solution spread for large size problems.",

However, successful implementation of human-robot collaboration scenarios requires adapted decision support tools. Workforce diversity can be mentioned as one of the factors that should be included to study its impact on both the performance of the production system and on ergonomics. Accordingly, in this research, a new bi-objective optimization model for the collaborative assembly line with Cobots is proposed to simultaneously minimize the cycle time and the physical workload of human operators. The workforce diversity of human operators is modeled through experience level and physical ability. To analyze the benefits of the developed model, a comparison between the different solutions from the Pareto front is conducted. The results show that the utilization of Cobots can reduce both cycle time and physical workload in the assembly line.",10

This paper introduces a deep learning framework for cognitive state assessment using Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain connectivity. The framework was evaluated using EEG data from 26 participants through three computer-based tasks: the Dual N-Back Task, Visual Search Task, and Continuous Performance Task, each designed to induce varying levels of cognitive workload, attention, and fatigue, respectively. A comprehensive dataset was meticulously compiled, including physiological, behavioral, and subjective data to ensure robust analyses. The EEG data underwent rigorous pre-processing and feature extraction processes, focusing on brain connectivity metrics such as Coherence and Phase-Locking Value across multiple frequency bands and employing three neural network architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks (ConvLSTM) for classification. The proposed work achieved classification accuracies of 96.53% for workload, 98.40% for attention, and 97.86% for fatigue in the combined frequency bands. The study’s findings underscore the potential of EEG-based methods for non-invasive cognitive state monitoring. By addressing existing limitations such as small sample sizes and task-specific models, this research enhances the generalizability and applicability of EEG-based cognitive assessments. The implications of these advancements are significant for fields requiring continuous cognitive monitoring, such as defense, healthcare, and high-risk operational environments.",

In the paper, a combined production planning and capacity control method for assembly lines is proposed aiming at balancing the workload of the human operators and decreasing the overall production costs on a given time horizon. Instead of using the idealistic cycle times and simple manufacturing control rules, the proposed planning and control methodology is based on adaptive calculations taken from continuously updated historical production data. The manufacturing execution-level data is applied for building regression models predicting the capacity requirements of the future production scenarios. Besides, the historical data is also used as direct input of discrete-event simulations, to determine the proper control policies of human operator allocations for the different scenarios mentioned above. In order to calculate reliable and feasible production plans, the regression models and control policies are integrated in a mathematical programming model that minimizes a cost function representing the total production costs.",3
JOUR,Does it deliver what it promises? Evaluation of cognitive distraction caused by speech-based interfaces with detection response and box task,"['Loew, Alexandra', 'Forster, Yannick', 'Naujoks, Frederik', 'Biebl, Bianca', 'Keinath, Andreas', 'Bengler, Klaus']",Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,91,1,16,2022,2022/11/01/,,1369-8478,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trf.2022.09.020,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847822002170'],"['Driver distraction', 'Cognitive workload', 'Speech-based assistants', 'Evaluation methods']","Speech is considered a promising modality for human-machine interaction while driving, especially in reducing visual and manual distraction. However, speech-based user interfaces themselves have shown to increase cognitive distraction. There remains a lack of standardized and unambiguous methods for measuring the impact of speech-based assistants on cognitive distraction while driving. This work aims to investigate whether the combination of the box task and the detection response task (DRT) is a suitable method for assessing the cognitive distraction caused by speech-based assistants. For this purpose, participants (N = 39) engaged in artificial (n-back tasks) and natural speech-based secondary tasks (interaction with Android’s Google Assistant and Apple's Siri) differing in predefined levels of cognitive workload while performing the box task and the DRT. The results showed that DRT performance differed between the 0-back and 1-back task but not between the different cognitive workload levels of the speech-based assistants. No clear effects emerged for the box task parameters. Thus, the combination of the box task and DRT is well-suited for measuring cognitive distraction caused by artificial secondary tasks but not by natural interactions with speech-based assistants.",

To determine favorable design and manufacturing solutions, designers must navigate this 3D spatial complexity while ensuring the functionality and manufacturability of their designs. Evaluating the manufacturability of their solutions necessitates modalities that help naturally visualize AM processes and the designs enabled by them. Digitally non-immersive visualization can reduce this expense, but digital immersion has the potential to further improve the experience before building. This research investigates how differences in immersion between computer-aided (CAx) and virtual reality (VR) environments affect a designer’s approach to solving a build-with-AM (BAM) problem and its outcomes. First, it studies how immersion affects determining favorable build orientations when considering the additive manufacturability outcomes of designs of varying complexity. Second, it studies how immersion affects the participants’ experiential outcomes, including evaluation time, attempts made, and cognitive load when solving the BAM problem. Analysis reveals that as design complexity increases, visualizing and manufacturing designs in VR improves additive manufacturability outcomes by reducing build time and support material usage compared to CAx, reducing manufacturing costs by up to 4.61 % ($32) per part. Using immersive VR also helps designers determine favorable build orientations faster with fewer attempts and without increasing the cognitive load experienced. These findings present important implications for the role of immersive experiences in preparing designers to quickly produce lower-cost and sustainable manufacturing solutions with AM.",
