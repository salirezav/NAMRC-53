AB  - Production lines, designed in a serial manner, have attracted the attention of researchers for many years. Line efficiency, throughput time and workload balancing are the main concerns regarding assembly lines, due to the high volume production. Recently, specific assembly line configurations, such as two-sided and parallel lines, have been addressed by researchers within the operational levels of production. Parallel two-sided assembly lines, rather a new research area, allocate more flexible workers and reduce throughput time by incorporating the advantages of two-sided and parallel assembly lines. Since parallel two-sided assembly lines are utilized to produce large-scale products, such as automobiles, trucks, and buses in industry; they also require a significant worker movement between parallel lines because of the unavoidable walking distances between lines. In this respect, different from the existing literature, walking distances have been included in parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problem with walking times and to propose the implementation of Bees Algorithm and Artificial Bee Colony algorithm due to the NP-hardness of the problem. An extensive computational study is also carried out and the comparative results are presented.

AB  - Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) with autonomous behavior and decentralized human–machine interaction (HMI) are suitable for use in logistics. To facilitate natural interaction, HMI may involve both speech and gesture control. This paper presents a new cognitive approach based on electroencephalography (EEG) for multimodal HMI combining speech and gesture control for AGVs used in logistics. The results indicate that implicit EEG-based measures such as alertness and relaxation significantly affect speech control performance. Consequently, monitoring the user's cognitive workload during logistic operations may lead to a substantial improvement in work performance.

AB  - Active back-support exoskeleton has emerged as a potential solution for mitigating work-related musculoskeletal disorders within the construction industry. Nevertheless, research has unveiled unintended consequences associated with its usage, most notably increased cognitive load. Elevated cognitive load has been shown to deplete working memory, potentially impeding task performance and situational awareness. Despite the susceptibility of exoskeleton users to increased cognitive load, there has been limited empirical evaluation of this risk while performing construction tasks. This study evaluates the cognitive load associated with using an active back-support exoskeleton while performing construction tasks. An experiment was conducted to capture brain activity using an Electroencephalogram, both with and without the use of an active back-support exoskeleton. A construction framing task involving six subtasks was considered as a case study. The participants’ cognitive load was assessed for the tested conditions and subtasks through the alpha band of the Electroencephalogram signals. The study identified the most sensitive Electroencephalogram channels for evaluating cognitive load when using exoskeletons. Statistical tests, including a one-way repeated measure ANOVA, paired t-test, and Spearman Rank were conducted to make inferences about the collected data. The results revealed that using an active back-support exoskeleton while performing the carpentry framing task increased the cognitive load of the participants, as indicated by four out of five significant Electroencephalogram channels. Selected channels in the frontal and occipital lobes emerged as the most influential channels in assessing cognitive load. Additionally, the study explores the relationships among Electroencephalogram channels, revealing strong correlations between selected channels in the frontal lobe and between channels in the occipital and frontal lobes. These findings enhance understanding of how specific brain regions respond to the use of active back support exoskeletons during construction tasks. By identifying which brain regions are most affected, this study contributes to optimizing exoskeleton designs to better manage cognitive load, potentially improving both the ergonomic effectiveness and safety of these devices in construction environments.

AB  - An Adaptive Spatial Augmented Reality system with dynamic in-situ projection of work instructions and information guidance already shows benefits in the field of industrial site assembly of aircraft components. Furthermore, the user-adaptive gesture control offers advantages for a human-centered and natural interaction directly in the assembly process. This paper presents results of enhancing dynamic in-situ projection, information guidance and user-adaptive gesture interaction in an advanced assembly process of large-sized toy building bricks. For this purpose, the dynamic projection system displays the location of the bricks in the material provision area as well as the accurate mounting position and dynamically guides the operator through the assembly process. Furthermore, the optimized gesture interaction with YOLO and an optimized synthetic dataset creation process for site assembly, indicate strong intentions for user-adaptive interaction with the projection system. An evaluation in the TU Wien pilot factory demonstrates benefits in terms of time savings in locating parts, usability and cognitive workload.

AB  - Drones are increasingly being used in the construction industry for numerous applications. However, their presence poses safety risks to construction workers who work around them but have limited control and information about these drones. To ensure safety, general construction workers who are not part of the pilot teams should also be able to communicate their concerns with drones effectively and naturally. Despite its importance, research on human-drone communication within construction for non-operator workers is scarce. This study developed and evaluated communication protocols using gesture and speech modalities to ensure safe human-drone interactions for non-operator workers in construction environments. An immersive VR environment replicating construction site dynamics was developed, enabling workers to utilize gesture or speech communication protocols while working with drones. A total of 100 participants were recruited for the user-centered study analysis on an immersive VR construction site, and the safety implications and cognitive loads of both protocols were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings suggest that gesture-based communication is more effective than speech-based communication in mitigating risks and alleviating the negative impacts of drones without imposing additional cognitive strain on users on construction sites.

AB  - During human–machine collaboration in manufacturing activities, it is important to provide real-time annotations in the three-dimensional workspace for local workers who may lack relevant experience and knowledge. For example, in MR assembly, workers need to be alerted to avoid entering hazardous areas when manually replacing components. Recently, many researchers have explored various visual cues for expressing physical task progress information in the MR interface of intelligent systems. However, the relationship between the implantation of visual cues and the balance of interface cognition has not been well revealed, especially in tasks that require annotating hazardous areas in complex operational terrains. In this study, we developed a novel MR interface for an intelligent assembly system that supports local scene sharing based on dynamic 3D reconstruction, remote expert behavior intention recognition based on deep learning, and local personnel operational behavior visual feedback based on external bounding box. We compared the encoding results of the proposed MR interface with 3D annotations combined with 3D sketch cues (3DS), which combines 3D spatial cues (3DSC) and 3DS combined with adaptive cues (AVC), through a case study. We found that for physical tasks that require specific area annotations, 3D annotations with context (3DAC) can better improve the quality of manual work and regulate the cognitive load distribution of the MR interface more reasonably.

AB  - Limb amputation can lead to significant functional challenges in daily activities, prompting amputees to use prosthetic devices (PDs). However, the cognitive demands of PDs and usability issues have resulted in user rejections. This study aimed to create a Human Performance Model for Upper-Limb Prosthetic Devices (HPM-UP). The model used formulations of learnability, error rate, memory load, efficiency, and satisfaction to assess usability. The model was validated in an experiment with 30 healthy participants using a bypass prosthetic device. Findings indicated that the HPM-UP successfully predicted the usability of prosthetic devices, aligning with human subject data. This research proposes a quantitative approach to predict upper limb prosthetic device usability by quantifying each dimension and computationally connecting them. The model, available on Github and executable with Rstudio, could enable clinicians to assess and analyze the human performance of various commercial prostheses, aiding in recommending optimal devices for patients.

AB  - Workload Control (WLC) is a method of adjusting the overall workload in the production system by controlling the input of production orders and the output of produced items. It contributes to the predictability of lead times and more accurate delivery date commitments in make-to-order manufacturing. Input control relates to order release and output control to capacity adjustment. In a recent previous work, a novel approach to integrated input–output control has been proposed: a dynamic closed-loop model where automatic feedback control is added and where order release and capacity decisions are based on the observed shop floor state. In this paper, this approach is further investigated in a more realistic hybrid simulation setting, combining discrete-time controllers and a discrete-event model of a manufacturing shop. The hybrid model was applied to two different systems: an elementary 4-machine shop floor (as a proof of concept) and a more complex real system, a manufacturing cell of cylinder liners. The results show that simultaneous input–output control is effective and enables the systems to maintain WIP balance, absorb demand fluctuations, and effectively reject disturbances. The simulations of the complex system showed that it might be advantageous to provide more local or more global information to the controllers, depending on the variability of the processing times and on the managerial focus. Closed-loop discrete-event models for WLC production control are unprecedented. Also, a simultaneous input and output control setting is much less reported in WLC literature than settings with input control only (i.e., order release only). This paper contributes in both ways.

AB  - The increased number of security cameras in modern cities has elevated the video-feed monitoring demands of closed-circuit television (CCTV) operators. As a result, new AI-driven support systems that leverage the power of computer vision algorithms have been deployed to facilitate the operators' work. However, to effectively design intuitive, AI-driven interfaces and validate their impact on the operators' performance, extensive user testing is required. To address this, we previously developed and tested a virtual reality (VR) control room that can be used to iteratively evaluate intelligent computer assistants and interfaces while operators are subjected to different cognitive load. In the present study, we use this VR environment and physiological markers (e.g., eye tracking measures) to investigate how AI-based visual cueing (i.e., pushing forward video streams on which detections are highlighted by rectangles drawn around targets) affects operator performance and cognitive load. Results suggest that support systems using such technology in a control room improve operators’ performance and decrease their cognitive load, as reflected by changes in pupil dilation and subjective reports irrespective of induced cognitive load.

However, few studies have investigated HFSP involving parallel machine scheduling and worker competencies. Therefore, this study investigates a complex product assembly line scheduling problem considering parallel team scheduling, worker competencies, and transport time. The makespan, transport time, imbalance degree of team workload, and imbalance degree of cycle time are taken as optimization objectives. First, a mathematical model considering transport time and worker competencies is developed, and then a mixed encoding and decoding method is proposed. Second, an algorithm that hybridizes the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm is proposed, involving an improved Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic method and a strengthened elite retention strategy to improve the quality of the solution. Finally, based on nine examples generated from real production statuses, the proposed algorithm is compared with the other four algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior in terms of the quality and efficiency of solutions.

AB  - Human factor is considered as a cost effective alternative to expensive automated solutions, as well as an easily interchangeable high flexible resource. However, for many years the influence of human behavior on production system performance has been underestimated and a lot of unrealistic assumptions have been used to simplify the human component modeling. Nowadays, population aging is acknowledged as a global trend. Among individual factors impacting on workers’ performance, high attention is being paid to the age from scientific community, policy-makers and business leaders. In this paper, demographic aspects and their implications on workforce composition are illustrated; successively, main findings on age-related performance characteristics are summarized. The authors propose an age- related model which aims to find optimal job rotation schedules in work environments characterized by low load manual tasks with a high frequency of repetition (e.g. assembly lines). The model is an integer programming model allowing for the maximization of the overall system performance jointly reducing and balancing human workloads and ergonomic risk within acceptable limits. A numerical example is proposed.

AB  - In recent years, the detection of cognitive load has received a lot of attention. Understanding the circumstances in which cognitive load occurs and reliably predicting such occurrences, offers the potential for considerable advances in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Numerous HCI applications, ranging from medical and health-related solutions to (smart) automotive environments, would directly benefit from the reliable detection of cognitive load. However, this task still remains highly challenging. We present a machine learning (ML) approach based on ensemble learning for robust cognitive load classification. The features used by the proposed solution are generated from the interpretation of physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate, r-r interval, skin temperature, and skin response) from a wearable device. Hence, our approach consists of two steps: (1) transforming the original data into discriminative features and (2) training an ensemble model to accurately and robustly predict cognitive load. The empirical results confirm that our method has a superior performance compared to various state-of-the-art baselines on the original and transformed data. Moreover, in the open-data CogLoad@UbiComp 2020 Competition, the proposed approach achieved the best results among 17 competing approaches and outperformed all participating competitors by a considerable margin.

AB  - Human robot collaboration is becoming the norm in the workplace, due to the benefits robots can bring to efficiency and production. However, this creates highly complex and dynamic workplaces that human operators need to adapt to. Industry 5.0 promotes the use of robotics and smart technologies in a more human-centric way. However, research on how operators are affected by those changes is needed to better understand how to move towards human-centricity. As such, an experimental study was designed and performed on human robot collaborative assembly. The main aim was to investigate the correlation between cognitive load and quality due to collaboration. Here, the preliminary results of the experimental study are presented in order to remark relevant states influencing work allocation. The results showcased the need for better training and more knowledge for the operators, as well as involving operators in process and workplace design. This study helps contribute knowledge on robot implementation and process design for human robot collaboration for both researchers and operations management, as it showcases the need to involve operators in those steps due to the feedback they can provide due to their experience.

AB  - Operator training is critical to ensure safe operation in safety-critical domains such as chemical process industries. Training enhances the operator's understanding of the process, which is then encapsulated as mental models. Typically, the operator's learning in traditional training programs is assessed using expert judgment or in terms of process- and operator action-based metrics. These assessment schemes, however, ignore the cognitive aspects of learning, such as mental model development and cognitive workload. The HMM-based model proposed in Part 1 offers a systematic way to quantify operators' cognition during abnormalities. In this Part 2, we show that the cognitive behaviors displayed by expert operators can be represented as target values on the HMM's state transitions and emission probability distributions. Further, we propose two axioms of learning that can capture the evolution of the operator's mental models as they learn the causal relationships in the process and gain expertise in handling abnormal situations. We validate the proposed axioms by conducting training experiments involving 10 participants performing 486 tasks. Our results reveal that the axioms can accurately assess the progress of operators' learning.

AB  - With the progressive digitalization in industrial manufacturing, the usage of complex robotic systems in both intralogistics and production is expected to increase. This proposes a challenge for planners and shop floor workers, as programming and interacting with these various systems leads to a high cognitive load. Especially the broad range of different manufacturer specific software leads to a number of problems, e.g. the program-synchronization between different systems and the often necessary workshops for workers. These problems can lead to inefficient programming and planning operations, bad worker satisfaction and human errors. In this paper, we present a modular, system agnostic and human centered software framework that unifies the programming of different systems, to enable centralized and intuitive system programming for non-expert operators. Our software framework utilizes visual programming concepts together with an integrated digital twin of the factory and a novel graph-based programming interface. We explain our concept in detail and describe our validation through integration into a realistic industrial setup with three different systems. In addition, we provide an evaluation of our concept's usability with an experimental user study and discuss the results of the study and the software implementation. Our study results show that even non-technical users are able to use our software after a brief introduction to create complex processes that involve multiple machines working in parallel. All users reported high usability and expert users reported that the visual process editor has enough features to create processes for industrial applications. Finally, we conclude this paper by providing an outlook on future work and use-cases of our software.

AB  - The human-nature connection is one of the main aspects determining supportive and comfortable office environments. In this context, the application of eye-tracking-equipped Virtual Reality (VR) devices to support an evaluation on the effect of greenery elements indoors on individuals’ efficiency and engagement is limited. A new approach to investigate visual attention, distraction, cognitive load and performance in this field is carried out via a pilot-study comparing three virtual office layouts (Indoor Green, Outdoor Green and Non-Biophilic). 63 participants completed cognitive tasks and surveys while measuring gaze behaviour. Sense of presence, immersivity and cybersickness results supported the ecological validity of VR. Visual attention was positively influenced by the proximity of users to the greenery element, while visual distraction from tasks was negatively influenced by the dimension of the greenery. In the presence of greenery elements, lower cognitive loads and more efficient information searching, resulting in improved performance, were also highlighted.

AB  - The Low/High Index of Pupillary Activity (LHIPA), an eye-tracked measure of pupil diameter oscillation, is redesigned and implemented to function in real-time. The novel Real-time IPA (RIPA) is shown to discriminate cognitive load in re-streamed data from earlier experiments. Rationale for the RIPA is tied to the functioning of the human autonomic nervous system yielding a hybrid measure based on the ratio of Low/High frequencies of pupil oscillation. The paper's contribution is drawn from provision of documentation of the calculation of the RIPA. As with the LHIPA, it is possible for researchers to apply this metric to their own experiments where a measure of cognitive load is of interest.

AB  - The current volatility on the global market presents new challenges in production system engineering and control. On the one hand, packaging and packaging production systems must support increasing production volumes. On the other hand, market volatility requires more flexible production that is fragmented into smaller batches, which causes increased time, effort, and overall workload implied by changeovers between different production setups. Typically, it is not feasible to build a green-field generation of production sites that conforms to all design principles of Industry 4.0. Therefore, the addressed approach deals with a “smartification” of legacy hardware components, bridging multiple levels of the traditional automation pyramid, improving human-machine collaboration, and transforming human experience into a common shared knowledge base. In more detail, we are applying unsupervised learning methods to generalize individual machine settings into reusable and automatically applicable control setups and strategies. The core components of the addressed packing lines are counting machines that deliver the required portions of elements. The developed Smart Counting Machines retain current interfaces that are enhanced with new enhancements providing OPC UA communication and modular control layer. The realized solution has been deployed and tested in a real packing line of our industrial partner. The lessons learned in the presented mitigate barriers on the journey from the proof-of-concept phase to the full production deployment.

AB  - In this study, a workforce scheduling and balancing problem is solved in unpaced sub-assembly lines with buffers feeding the paced body assembly line of a car manufacturer. The goal is to determine the minimum workforce required to process split lots at sub-assembly stations to feed the paced line over a periodic time window. Limited by a given buffer capacity at each station but with flexible start times for each split lot, an efficient workforce scheduling is possible to prevent shortages in downstream stations. Therefore, a stock-continuity equation has been proposed yielding the size of those split lots. Next, a single-objective Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model is formulated for the problem as a combination of two implicitly weighted goals to minimise the workforce and the unbalanced workloads. The problem is a variant of workforce scheduling and routing problem with time windows and negligible walking distances. Due to the non-deterministic polynomial-time-hardness of the problem, we proposed an improved Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm named as discrete ABC with solution acceptance rule and multi-search (SAMSABC). The proposed algorithm is compared with different variants of ABC and other well-known metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimisation and Differential Evolution on generated test cases. The computational results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ABC algorithm and reveal that the SAMSABC can achieve accurate results within short computational times.

AB  - Noise is one of the environmental factors with mental and physical effects. The workload is also the multiple mental and physical demands of the task. Therefore, his study investigated the relationship between noise exposure and mood states at different levels of workload. The study recruited 50 workers from the manufacturing sector (blue-collar workers) as the exposed group and 50 workers from the office sector (white-collar workers) as the control group. Their occupational noise exposure was measured by dosimetry. The Stress-Arousal Checklist (SACL) and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) were used to measure mood and workload, respectively. The equivalent noise exposure level of the exposed group at high and very high workload levels was 85 and 87 dBA, respectively. The mean mood score of the exposed group was 76 at very high workload. The correlation coefficient between noise exposure level and mood state based on workload levels ranged from 0.3 at medium workload to 0.57 at very high workload. Noise exposure at high workload levels can increase its adverse effects, so controlling and optimizing the multiple demands of the task in the workplace can be used as a privative measure to reduce the adverse effects of noise.

AB  - Exhausting manual labor is still predominant in the industrial context. It typically consists in manipulating heavy parts or working in nonergonomic conditions. The resulting work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem to tackle. The most-affected body section is the lumbar spine. Recently, exoskeletons have been identified as a possible non-invasive solution to reduce the impact of low-back pain. State-of-the-art prototypes have been optimized to: follow unconstrained human kinematics, (partially) relieve the load on assisted joints, and allow anthropometric adaptation. Yet, this technology still has limited adoption. Manufacturing optimization may address the following limitations: bulky/heavy resulting designs, complex assembly and maintenance, high manufacturing costs, long procedures for adaptation and wearing, and psychological effects (e.g., cognitive load and usability). In this contribution, the aforementioned issues are tackled improving a previous low-back exoskeleton prototype. In particular, kinematic analysis, Finite-Element-Method, and topological optimization have been combined to obtain a lightweight prototype, testing different materials (Nylon, carbon-fiber reinforced PC/ABS, etc.).We applied both Design for Assembly and Design for Manufacturability. The resulting exoskeleton prototype is described in the paper, ready for end-user field tests

This problem consists of determining the best assignment of the assembly tasks to workers as well as the workers to workstations in accordance with some desired objectives. Task times differ depending on worker skills. Two optimization criteria are considered to be minimized, the cycle time and the smoothness index of the workload of the line. The efficiency of the proposed MOEA is evaluated over a set of benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature. A suitable performance analysis is deployed concerning the quality of the Pareto solutions. The results demonstrate a very satisfactory performance in terms of solution quality.

AB  - Efficient and natural programming strategies play a crucial role in enabling human-guided robotic assembly to adapt quickly to dynamic tasks. The combination of Augmented Reality (AR) and Digital Twins (DT) has shown promising potential in enhancing the intuitiveness of human–robot interaction while leveraging digital representations of human intelligence to empower robots in manufacturing tasks. However, traditional programming methods lack intuitive interaction and rely heavily on simulation environments or pre-set CAD models, leading to high costs for both initial setup and sim-to-real deployment. On the other hand, existing AR-based robot control methods have primarily focused on the basic movements of robots, overlooking higher-level skills necessary for complex tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces a four-layer system architecture that integrates AR-assisted DT into skill-based robotic assembly scenarios. Additionally, a skill-based and low-code programming system for human-guided robotic assembly is designed and implemented, which incorporates natural human guidance and robot autonomous intelligence to generate adaptive and feasible action plans. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are verified by two case studies and a quantitative experiment comparing to traditional programming methods. The results demonstrate the usability of our AR-assisted DT approach in improving programming efficiency, intuitiveness, and safety for human-guided robotic assembly while reducing cognitive load.

AB  - An emerging shortage of resources fosters a development for strategies for the circularity of products and resources. Due to the different states of returned end-of-life products, the complexity for employees in disassembly increases. This work aims to provide an approach for an optimal allocation of disassembly tasks to individual employees and therefore enable a basis for planning and control in disassembly. At first, a task description is provided based on which a standardized time for operations is considered. Second, a link is created between the task description and the product state. Depending on the product state the time determined prior can be adjusted. Third, human skills are considered in manufacturing. It is assumed that within a production system there are different employees with different, developing skill sets. Based on specific skills, a task-to-person-is conducted. Using the information gathered, a Digital Twin (DT) that includes the human nature of the employees and their state is created to enable a simulation of tasks and thereby also a learning system for “first-time-seen” products. When facing complex tasks, the cognitive load and human's fatigue are decisive for performance and thereby the time required for execution. Completing these steps, a multistage concept is created that enables a more precise disassembly planning that can be shown in the case study on the example of components of electric vehicles.

AB  - Oscillatory components are discriminative features of mental workload monitoring in electrodermal activity (EDA) signals. Currently, most feature extraction techniques mainly focus on time domain or linear techniques but rarely consider the non-stationary nature, individual differences, and recording noise. This study has proposed a new time–frequency feature extraction method based on Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform providing an effective quantification of oscillatory behavior of a single transient. The extracted features have been classified using a recurrent neural network with the advantage of dynamic mapping procedure. The proposed method has been evaluated using EDA data acquired during an arithmetic task of five workload levels with both subtle and distinct differences. In a comparative study, the effects of several decomposition parameters and cognitive factors have been explored. Experimental results have shown that it achieves an average accuracy rate of 98.52% for three workload levels discrimination by optimizing the number of features to 3 (features extracted from a low frequency sub-band) from 15 (features extracted from five frequency sub-bands), i.e., 80% feature reduction. The greatest contribution coming fromthe smallest frequency sub-bands has also been obtained. This method is superior to other existing methods in separating 3 to 5 workload levels with both distinct and subtle differences extracting effective oscillatory characteristics. Considering the merits of a simple feature extraction procedure and cost-effectiveness of a single lead EDA signal as well as high discriminability between several workload levels, it provides a trade-off between performance and computational complexity, thus demonstrating its potential for online human-error prevention systems.

AB  - Teams formulated by aviation professionals are essential in maintaining a safe and efficient aerodrome environment. Nonetheless, the shared situational awareness between the flight crews under adverse weather conditions might be impaired. This research aims to evaluate the impact of a proposed enhancement in communication protocol on cognitive workload and develop a human-centred classification model to identify hazardous meteorological conditions. Thirty groups of subjects completed four post-landing taxiing tasks under two visibility conditions (CAVOK/CAT IIIA) while two different communication protocols (presence/absence of turning direction information) were adopted by the air traffic control officer (ATCOs). Electroencephalography (EEG) and the NASA Task Load Index were respectively used to reflect the pilot’s mental state and to evaluate the pilot’s mental workload subjectively. Results indicated that impaired visibility increases the subjective workload significantly, while the inclusion of turning direction information in the ATCO’s instruction would not significantly intensify their cognitive workload. Mutual information was used to quantitatively assess the shared situational awareness between the pilot flying and the pilot monitoring. Finally, this research proposes a human-centred approach to identify potentially hazardous weather conditions from EEG power spectral densities with Bayesian neural networks (BNN). The classification model has outperformed other baseline algorithms with an accuracy of 66.5%, an F1 score of 61.4%, and an area under the ROC of 0.749. Using the concept of explainable AI with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values, the exploration of latent mental patterns formulates novel knowledge to gain insights into the vital physiological indicators of the pilots in response to different scenarios from the BNN model. In the long term, the model facilitates the decision regarding the necessity of providing automation and decision-making aids to pilots.

AB  - The design of complex manufacturing systems (CMSs) is challenging, because of the requirements of efficiency, safety, and ergonomics, and the need of optimizing resources, i.e., space, machines, operators, and data. Virtual reality (VR) – one of the promising technologies at the base of Industry 4.0 – is able to address the design issues of CMSs, and even decrease costs and time when employed from the initial conception to the final validation of production lines, since it facilitates their virtual commissioning, i.e., it enables the full verification of systems and related components by virtual inspection and tests. Despite the above advantages, VR is still rarely used in the design of CMSs, and there is no standard VR approach in industry yet. In addition, the related scientific literature is scarce and often limited to small or simplified cases. To fill this gap, this work presents a novel VR-based approach for designing CMSs, composed of four phases: Three-dimensional CAD Export, Model Import, Scene Creation, and VR Review. The proposed approach is applied to a real industrial use case related to the virtual commissioning of an electric axles production line and it is evaluated through a questionnaire from industry professionals. The case study shows that using the VR technology enhanced the technical communication between experts in the teamwork, and it was particularly effective in finding ergonomics flaws like issues in visibility, reach, and posture using a virtual golden zone. In addition, all users found the VR interaction enjoyable and easy to learn, and beginner users perceived a comparable workload as advanced users.

AB  - Manufacturing ergonomics refers to the application of ergonomic principles and human factors analysis to the design of manufacturing tasks with the final aim to optimize the workers’ wellbeing and guarantee the expected process performance. Traditional design approaches are based on the observation of individual workers performing their jobs, the detection of unnatural postures (e.g., bending, twisting, overextending, rotating), and the definition of late corrective actions according to ergonomic guidelines. Recently, computer-integrated simulations based on virtual prototypes and digital human models (DHMs) can be used to assess manufacturing ergonomics on virtual manikins operating in digital workplaces. Such simulations allow validating different design alternatives and optimizing the workstation design before the creation, and pave the way to a new approach to manufacturing system design. The present paper aims at comparing different computer-integrated set-ups to support the design of human-centred manufacturing workstations. It defines a protocol analysis to support workstation design by analysing both physical and cognitive aspects, and applies the protocol within different digital set-ups. In particular, the study investigates a 2D desktop set-up using standardized DHMs and a 3D immersive mixed reality set-up based on motion capture of real workers’ acting into a mixed environment, comparing them with the traditional approach. An industrial case study focusing on design optimization of a manufacturing workstation in the energy industry is used to test the effectiveness of the two digital set-ups for the definition of re-design actions.

Latest research suggests that AR systems should meet the user’s needs to deliver a personalized experience and therefore improve the adoption of the technology. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of theoretical guidance to design AR-based assistance capable of delivering both the right level of details of information and the best information design, based on the user’s needs. To address this problematic, we developed a methodology describing the principle of adaptive assistance as well as standard characteristics and criteria to design Augmented Reality-based Adaptive Assistance Systems (ARAAS). We applied this methodology on an industrial maintenance use case in the context of landing gears’ overhaul operation. The feedbacks from different profiles of inspectors underline the usefulness of such system and its capacity to deliver an assistance adapted to their needs.

AB  - Collaborative robots are an important enabling technology of Industry 4.0. The interaction between humans and robots, called Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), aims to improve system performance. However, it is necessary to investigate in depth the effects of this close interaction on workers identifying individual factors involved and discerning which of them affect the introduction of HRC in a manufacturing system. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the collaboration between humans and robots, identifying how the operator’s work is affected by HRC. A scoping review was conducted to identify the main impacts of HRC on worker’s performance. Based on the results, a preliminary taxonomy of key factors influencing the performance of collaborative operators was identified. The results highlighted the importance of trust, usability, and acceptance as key requirements for the successful introduction of HRC, whereas factors as stress and workload of workers are both positively and negatively affected by HRC.

KW  - Cognitive load theory

KW  - Individual differences through learning
AB  - Cognitive load theory is an instructional theory based on the following assumptions. (1) Information can be divided into biologically primary information that we have evolved to process and acquire unconsciously, and secondary information that requires conscious effort. (2) Secondary information is either acquired during problem solving or from other people. It is processed by a limited capacity, limited duration working memory before being stored for subsequent use in long-term memory. Once stored, information may be transferred back to working memory to govern action relevant to the extant environment. Working memory has no known capacity or duration limits when dealing with information transferred back from long-term memory. (3) The major consequence that flows from instruction is the accumulation of information in long-term memory. (4) That differential knowledge results in individual differences in expertise and provides a major source, possibly the only source, of modifiable cognitive differences between learners. (5) Learners with differential knowledge held in long-term memory require different instructional procedures leading to the expertise reversal effects of cognitive load theory.
Educational relevance
Cognitive load theory is an instructional theory based on our knowledge of evolutionary psychology leading to human cognitive architecture. That architecture specifies individual differences due to either biological or environmental factors. Information held in long-term memory provides the major source of environmentally mediated individual differences. The theory uses randomised, controlled trials to determine instructional effectiveness.

AB  - Augmented reality (AR) technology could establish direct relationships between displayed information and objects in the real driving environment, e.g. by highlighting relevant objects in the traffic environment. However, it is unclear how these potential benefits of augmentation affect drivers’ distraction from the driving task and their level of workload. Since gaze detection cannot separate glances at AR-elements from glances at the driving scene, new evaluation criteria are needed for measuring the distraction potential of AR-elements. The paper evaluates a methodology based on the Detection Response Task (DRT) for measuring the distraction and workload effects of three different display technologies: Head-Down Display (HDD), Head-Up Display (HUD), and Augmented-Reality HUD (AR-HUD). The DRT measures cognitive and visual workload based on a recognition-response task using the two parameters, reaction time and misses. Two experimental studies using driving simulation (N = 24) and production vehicles in real traffic (N = 24) are reported. As use cases, the subjects had to navigate through an urban traffic environment and pass different intersections. During that they were assisted by navigation systems based on the above mentioned display technologies. The resulting workload is compared to a baseline drive without the need to navigate and a reference drive in which the subjects had to work on a secondary task while driving. The results of the DRT are compared with subjective measures, gaze behaviour, and driving performance. In addition, drivers’ preference and user experience regarding the three display technologies and their feedback concerning the DRT method were assessed. The results of both experimental studies show that drivers prefer the AR-HUD display technology. Reasons are mainly the hedonic aspects of the AR-HUD such as the novelty of the technology. Nevertheless, drivers report that AR-elements could obstruct important areas of the road and distract more from the driving task than HUDs. The subjective and visual-cognitive workload measured by the DRT do not differ between the HMI conditions. An analysis for each type of intersection yields most misses for the AR-HUD condition and fewest misses in the HDD condition. However, visual workload (i.e. eyes-off-road time) is higher for HDD compared to (AR-)HUD. Feedback by participants reveals that the DRT as a method for workload assessment is well accepted. All in all, the two DRT measures, misses and reaction time, allow a valid and objective workload measurement and could serve as a supplement or substitute for gaze analysis. The discussion gives indications for the measurement of workload effects caused by AR-HUD using DRT.

AB  - In human cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology studies, laboratory-based research tasks have been important to establish principles of brain function and its relationship to behaviour; however, they differ greatly from real-life experiences. Several elements of real-life situations that impact human performance, such as stressors, are difficult or impossible to replicate in the laboratory. Expeditions offer unique possibilities for studying human cognition in complex environments that can transfer to other situations with similar features. For example, as caves share several of the physical and psychological challenges of safety-critical environments such as spaceflight, underground expeditions have been developed as an analogue for astronaut training purposes, suggesting that they might also be suitable for studying aspects of behaviour and cognition that cannot be fully examined under laboratory conditions. While a large range of topics and tools have been proposed for application in such environments, few have been used in the field. Methods and procedures for maximizing the robustness and scientific value of expedition research designs must first be developed and validated. We tested the feasibility of collecting human physiological, cognitive, and subjective experience data concerning brain state, sleep, cognitive workload, and fatigue, during a speleological expedition in a remote region. We document our approaches and challenges experienced, and provide recommendations and suggestions to aid future work. The data support the idea that cave expeditions are relevant naturalistic paradigms that offer unique possibilities for cognitive neuroscience to complement laboratory work and help improve human performance and safety in operational environments.

AB  - Line balancing and job rotation have been recently found to be effective methods to reduce workers’ ergonomic risks since the design/planning phase of assembly lines, and at the same time to limit performances deterioration and/or costs increments. As far as we know, there are no papers in the literature that deals with the problem of assigning rest times to workers in assembly lines with the aim to reduce their ergonomic workload. In the paper the problem of assigning rest times to workers in assembly lines is considered (Rest Time Assignment Problem). We show how rest times assignment affects ergonomic risk of workers in mixed-model assembly lines when this is evaluated through the Occupational Repetitive Action index (OCRA), and suggest and approach to simultaneously find solutions for the Assembly Line Balancing Problem and the Rest Time Assignment Problem.

AB  - Hand-tracking enables controller-free interaction with virtual environments, which can make virtual reality (VR) experiences more natural and immersive. As naturalness hinges on both technological and human influence factors, fine-tuning the former while assessing the latter can be used to increase overall experience. This paper investigates a reach-grab-place task inside VR using two input modalities (hand-tracking vs. handheld-controller). Subjects (N = 33) compared the two input methods available on a consumer grade VR headset for their effects on objective user performance and subjective experience of the perceived sense of presence, cognitive workload, and ease-of-use. We found that virtual hands (with hand-tracking) did not influence the subjective feelings of perceived presence, naturalness, & engagement; neither did it inspire the overall ease-of-use while performing the task. In fact, subjects completed the task faster and felt a lower mental workload and higher overall usability with handheld-controllers. The result found that in this particular case, hand-tracking did not improve the psychological and emotional determinants of immersive VR experiences. The study helps expand on our understanding of the two input modalities in terms of their viability for naturalistic experiences in VR akin to real-world scenarios.

AB  - Spatial navigation is essential for orienting oneself in familiar and novel environments. Several internal factors may affect spatial navigation, such as anxiety. This study explored the mediating role of anxiety (spatial, trait and state) in the relationship between cognitive load and spatial navigation (egocentric and allocentric) using parallel mediation models. A sample of 125 participants (60 females) completed self-reported measures of anxiety (spatial and state-trait) during free navigation in a virtual reality square with or without environmental cognitive load. After the virtual learning experience, three spatial tasks evaluating landmark recognition and the use of egocentric and allocentric coordinates were administered. Results showed that spatial anxiety partially mediated the relationship between environmental load and spatial skills, specifically for egocentric and allocentric tasks. In addition, trait anxiety mediated the relationship between environmental load and allocentric performance. Overall, these findings update the Environmental Knowledge Model (EKM) that explains human navigation in terms of individual and environmental factors. The study results suggest that navigation could be facilitated by reducing anxiety and the spatial complexity of the environment.

However, the impact of information load of dashboards on cognitive load has rarely been investigated. The roles of user cognitive styles were also ignored. This study examined the effect of dashboard information load and user cognitive style on cognitive load when using dashboards in the construction industry. We designed a visual search experiment with five information load levels. Fifty-six participants, divided into field-dependent (FD) and field-independent (FI) groups, participated in the experiment. The results showed that the FI group had a lower cognitive load and was more efficient than the FD group. The effect of information load on cognitive load followed a piecewise linear correlation with the two prominent knots. The findings underscore the importance of assessing the information load and providing psychological underpinnings for cognitive-fit dashboard design for smart construction management.

AB  - Over the years, safety in maritime industries has been reinforced by many state-of-the-art technologies. However, the accident rate hasn’t dropped significantly with the advanced technology onboard. The main cause of this phenomenon is human errors which drive researchers to study human factors in the maritime domain. One of the key factors that contribute to human performance is their mental states such as cognitive workload and stress. In this paper, we propose and implement an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based psychophysiological evaluation system to be used in maritime virtual simulators for monitoring, training and assessing the seafarers. The system includes an EEG processing part, visualization part, and an evaluation part. By using the processing part of the system, different brain states including cognitive workload and stress can be identified from the raw EEG data recorded during maritime exercises in the simulator. By using the visualization part, the identified brain states, raw EEG signals, and videos recorded during the maritime exercises can be synchronized and displayed together. By using the evaluation part of the system, an indicative recommendation on “pass”, “retrain”, or “fail” of the seafarers’ performance can be obtained based on the EEG-based cognitive workload and stress recognition. Detailed analysis of the demanding events in the maritime tasks is provided by the system for each seafarer that could be used to improve their training. A case study is presented using the proposed system. EEG data from 4 pilots were recorded when they were performing maritime tasks in the simulator. The data are processed and evaluated. The results show that one pilot gets a “pass” recommendation, one pilot gets a “retrain” recommendation, and the other two get “fail” results regarding their performance in the simulator.

AB  - The complexity and diversity of products significantly increases the difficulty of training workers in modern industries. AR training, as a combination of industrial digital development and new interactive means, has attracted increasingly more attention. However, in human factor and education, research regarding AR based training is still in its infancy. To understand how AR could help industrial training from a human perspective, we evaluate a HoloLens-based AR training method for an assembly task on natural human behavior and the training effectiveness. Forty-four participants were equally divided into AR and ordinary training groups with the equivalent instructional materials, which included text information and 3D models. Results show that although AR did not significantly affect the overall workload and system usability assessment (SUS) recorded, several experimental values increased significantly compared with the ordinary training method, including task completion time, time required to interpret text-based information, amount of attention switching, and training effectiveness. Consequently, the use of AR did not result in a completion time and workload reduction; however, we found that training with the AR system was more effective than ordinary training in increasing the knowledge retention of participants without increasing their overall workload, especially for the month-term memory. Nonetheless, a longer time was required by the users to familiarize themselves with the AR environment and read the text information. The findings of this work could contribute to the design of future AR training systems in industry considering natural human behavior and enhance training effectiveness.

This study investigates how the difficulty of such tasks influences emotional states, cognitive workload and task performance. We use quantitative and qualitative measurements, including the recording of pupil dilation and changes in affect using questionnaires. Participants were required to perform a number of air traffic control tasks using the immersive human accessible Virtual Reality space in the "eXperience Induction Machine". Based on the data collected, we developed and validated a model which integrates personality, workload and affective theories. Our results indicate that the difficulty of an air traffic control task has a direct influence on cognitive workload as well as on the self-reported mood; whereas both mood and workload seem to change independently. In addition, we show that personality, in particular neuroticism, affects both mood and performance of the participants.

AB  - Cognitive neuroscience investigates the intricate connections between brain function and mental processing to understand the cognitive architecture. Exploring the human brain, the epicenter of cognitive activity, offers valuable insights into underlying cognitive processes. To monitor brain states corresponding to various mental activities, appropriate measurement tools are essential. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals serve as a valuable tool for recording patterns and changes in electrical brain activities. Leveraging non-linear signal processing techniques holds promise for advancing our understanding of brain activities during cognitive tasks. In this study, we analyze the electrical activity of the brain using EEG data collected from subjects engaged in a cognitive workload task. Employing wavelet-based analysis, we capture changes in the structure of EEG signals before and during a mental arithmetic task. Additionally, spectral analysis is conducted to discern alterations in the distribution of spectral contents of EEG signals. Our findings underscore the efficacy of wavelet-based analysis and spectral entropy in quantifying the time-varying and non-stationary nature of EEG recordings, offering effective frameworks for distinguishing between different cognitive activities. Consequently, these methods afford deeper insights into the cognitive architecture by tracking changes in the distribution of the time-varying spectrum.

Consequently, respective workloads as well as supplied materials have to be balanced due to limitations in resource capacities. As first step planning defines the solution space for second step planning, this paper introduces a mathematical model for order assignments to plants and periods anticipating assignments to lines and cycles.

Twenty-four males and females, randomly divided into control and exoskeleton groups, performed an overhead reaching and pointing task over three days without (single task) and with (dual task) a working memory task. Task performance, electromyography (EMG), neural activity, heart rate, and subjective responses were collected. While task completion time reduced for both groups at the same rate over days, EMG activity of shoulder muscles was lower for the exoskeleton group for both tasks, specifically for females during the dual task. Dual task reduced the physiological benefits of exoskeletons and neuromotor strategies to adapt to the dual task demands differed between the groups. Neuromuscular benefits of exoskeleton use were immediately realized irrespective of cognitive demand, however the perceptual, physiological, and neural adaptations with exoskeleton use were task- and sex-specific.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding optimized assembly sequences, a classical case study taken from the literature is finally discussed.

AB  - Due to the complex and changeable contextual environment, the human factor risk of the manned deep submergence operating system shows dynamic characteristics. Compared with the traditional static human reliability analysis (HRA) method, dynamic HRA method can better simulate the dynamic characteristics and the nonlinear information feedback mechanism of the operating system. This paper proposed a dynamic risk assessment model based on System Dynamics and SPAR-H. The cognitive load was introduced into the Performance Shaping Factor (PSF) network to make it more suitable for the task and environment of manned deep submergence. In addition, in order to measure the compensation effect of PSF on the work efficiency of oceanauts, eight compensation functions were constructed between PSFs and work efficiency. Finally, key risk tasks and sensitive PSFs were identified. Taking the 12 h manned deep diving mission as an example, the dynamic quantification of human error probability and work efficiency of oceanauts was simulated. The results indicate that the dynamic simulation results of the constructed risk assessment model are consistent with the actual situation, and can effectively predict the changes of dynamic risk.

KW  - Multi-objective optimization
AB  - Ergonomics is an essential aspect to deal with while solving problems related to manual assembly, for the effects it may have on both productivity and human factor related issues. The frequent execution of repetitive movements and the handling of heavy components are among the main factors that characterize the assembly process, potentially resulting in worker’s overload. An appropriate distribution of assembly operations and, therefore of relative workloads, on a production line can improve ergonomic aspects, according to the worker's anthropometric and physiological characteristics. In this paper, a multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving the assembly line balancing problem taking into account ergonomics based on energy expenditure is proposed. The novelty of the contribution relies in the assignment of assembly tasks to workstations considering a set of human operators actually available in a company. The assignment of workers is based on their physical capabilities and limits, evaluated according to their anthropometric and physiological characteristics. The objectives of the problem, besides the minimization of the number of workstations, are related to the human factor; in particular, the distribution of assembly tasks to workstations according to worker technical skills and to worker physical capabilities are optimized. A practical case study taken from the industrial reality is finally tested and discussed.

AB  - Industry 5.0 complements Industry 4.0 aiming to create a sustainable, human-centered, and resilient industry. In this context, enabling technologies, such as artificial intelligence, internet of everything, and digital twins, can be used to monitor and enhance the workforce to improve the efficiency and resilience of the entire manufacturing system. By developing socio-technical digital twin architectures, companies will be able in the short future to monitor machines, products, and workers' real-time states as a whole ecosystem. In this study, the authors focus their attention on human digital twin solutions for manufacturing systems, enabling dynamic scheduling of jobs by minimizing the makespan and considering a set of workers’ parameters that are continuously monitored through an ergonomic digital platform. This paper proposes the architecture of a real-time monitoring system and how it can help detect awkward postural behavior or unbalanced workload among workers, according to their individual features. At the same time, the system interacts with the human digital twin system which proposes a rescheduling of the jobs whenever it is necessary. Finally, a discussion on the practical limitations of human digital twin implementations in industrial environments is provided.

AB  - This research proposes an approach for evaluating human-centered work processes by combining Value Stream Mapping and ergonomic assessment of physical workload. Value Stream Mapping is a method used to create a visual representation of the flow of materials and information required to deliver a product, and aids in identifying potential bottlenecks and other constraints. However, it does not consider the effect of physical ergonomics on process execution and planning. To bridge this gap, the Ergonomic Assessment Worksheet screening tool is used to gain insight into unfavourable physical workload situations. The proposed approach follows five main steps: (i) scope definition, (ii) Value Stream Map, (iii) time study, (iv) ergonomic assessment, (v) combined analysis. A case study is conducted at a bicycle manufacturer to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in quantifying the impact of physical ergonomics on process performance. The method enables a systematic analysis of process chains to identify critical steps from both lean and ergonomic perspectives, emphasizing the importance of worker's physical well-being and the ability of ergonomic assessment methods to enhance Value Stream Maps.

AB  - Manufacturing assembly tasks can vary in complexity and level of automation. Yet, achieving full automation can be challenging and inefficient, particularly due to the complexity of certain assembly operations. Human-robot collaborative work, leveraging the strengths of human labor alongside the capabilities of robots, can be a solution for enhancing efficiency. This paper introduces the CT benchmark, a benchmark and model set designed to facilitate the testing and evaluation of human-robot collaborative assembly scenarios. It was designed to compare manual and automatic processes using metrics such as the assembly time and human workload. The components of the model set can be assembled through the most common assembly tasks, each with varying levels of difficulty. The CT benchmark was designed with a focus on its applicability in human-robot collaborative environments, with the aim of ensuring the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Experiments were carried out to assess assembly performance in three different setups (manual, automatic and collaborative), measuring metrics related to the assembly time and the workload on human operators. The results suggest that the collaborative approach takes longer than the fully manual assembly, with an increase of 70.8%. However, users reported a lower overall workload, as well as reduced mental demand, physical demand, and effort according to the NASA-TLX questionnaire.

AB  - This paper addresses new Mixed-model Assembly Line Balancing Problems (MALBP) in a real industrial context, the stitching systems of a footwear company. The work is part of large ongoing projects with this industry, and the main purposes are minimising the number of required workstations and smoothing the operators’ workload. The company has invested in new flexible automated assembly systems, which accommodate dozens of workstations and many moving boxes. Footwear components are inside boxes (with various quantities) which can move from the warehouses to a convenient workstation or between any workstations (in any order). This is a significant and distinct feature of the MALBP, together with the fact that the assignment of different skilled operators and machines is achieved simultaneously. An optimisation model is developed, in part to facilitate the understanding of the situation and to solve small-size instances. Due to the complexity of the problems, we had to devise an approximate method, based on the Variable Neighbourhood Descent (VND) metaheuristic and integrating an adaptation of the Ranked Positional Weighted (RPW) method. The adapted RPW method is used to create initial feasible solutions, while preassigning special operators and machines. After choosing good initial solutions, VND is applied to improve their quality. The new contributed method, named as RPW-VNDbal, is tested with medium and large instances, in two distinct stitching systems. A Lower Bound of the objective function and Simulation contribute to evaluate the solutions and their practicability. The results implemented by the project team, show that the RPW-VNDbal method is fast enough and offers better solutions than those implemented by the experienced operation managers of the company.

AB  - Malicious content threatens the integrity and quality of content in social networks. Research and practice have experimented with network intervention strategies to curb malicious content propagation. These strategies lack efficiency, target malicious content propagators, and abridge freedom of speech. We draw upon the preferential attachment literature and cognitive load theory to employ the mechanisms of network formation, information sharing, and limited human cognitive capacities to propose an alternative feed management strategy—Preferentiality Dampened Feed Management. We compare and contrast this strategy against other established strategies using an agent-based model that utilizes empirical data from Twitter and findings from the prior literature. The results from our two experiments suggest that our proposed strategy is more effective in curbing malicious content propagation than other established strategies. Our work has important implications for the network interventions literature and practical implications for platform providers, social media users, and society.

AB  - Cognitive load assessment plays a crucial role in monitoring safe production, resource allocation, and subjective initiative in human-computer interaction. Due to its high time resolution and convenient acquisition, Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely applied in brain monitoring and cognitive state assessment. In this study, a multi-scale Swin Transformer network (MST-Net) was proposed for cognitive load assessment, which extracts local features with different sensory fields using a multi-scale parallel convolution model and introduces the attention mechanism of the Swin Transformer to obtain the feature correlations among multi-scale local features. The performance of the proposed network was validated using the EEG signals collected during cognitive tasks and N-back tasks with three different load levels. Results show that the MST-Net network achieved the best classification accuracy on both local and public datasets, and was higher than the mainstream Swin Transformer and CNN. Furthermore, results of ablation experiments and feature visualization revealed that the proposed MST-Net could well characterize different cognitive loads, which not only provided novel and powerful tools for cognitive load assessment but also showed potential for broad application in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.

AB  - We consider a supplier who delivers modules to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) just-in-time and just-in-sequence. Production at the supplier is done via a mixed-model assembly line. The time between knowing the OEM sequence and delivering the finished workpieces to the OEM is small. Nonetheless, resequencing for the mixed-model assembly line at the supplier might be advantageous under various objectives such as workload balancing, leveling of materials consumption or color batching. However, if resequencing is done, the effort to restore the original OEM sequence should be small to achieve this in time. We propose a model for optimizing resequencing under the condition that restoring the original sequence is achieved via a first-in-first-out (FIFO) strategy, where workpieces are stored in mix banks at the end of production and only the workpieces at the front of those banks have to be dispatched in order to rebuild the original sequence. The model is the combination of an assignment or traveling salesman and a vehicle routing problem. We adapt the load balancing, material leveling, and color batching problem from the sequencing literature to our formulation and present numerical results derived from a controlled testbed. They show that, compared to producing the OEM sequence as-is, huge savings in the objective values ( > 50% on average), are made. Furthermore, a limited lookahead approach leads to good solutions in just a small number of seconds, even for large scale problems.

AB  - Assembly lines are frequently used as a production method to assemble complex products. Two-sided assembly lines are utilized to assemble large-sized products (e.g., cars, buses, trucks). Locating two lines in parallel helps improve line efficiency by enabling collaboration between the line workers. This paper proposes a mixed-model parallel two-sided assembly line system that can be utilized to produce large-sized items in an inter-mixed sequence. The mixed-model parallel two-sided line balancing problem is defined and the advantages of utilizing multi-line stations across the lines are discussed. A flexible agent-based ant colony optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problem and a numerical example is given to explain the method systematically. The proposed algorithm builds flexible balancing solutions suitable for any model sequence launched. The dynamically changing workloads of workstations (based on specific product models during the production process) are also explored. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted and the results are statistically analyzed using the well-known paired sample t-test. The test results indicate that the mixed-model parallel two-sided assembly line system reduces the workforce need in comparison with separately balanced mixed-model two-sided lines. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the tabu search algorithm and six heuristics often used in the assembly line balancing domain.

However, little is known with respect to two major issues: (i) how these technologies can be seamlessly integrated for product/process and overall manufacturing system management providing of syntactic, semantic and functional interoperability and reusability among the different manufacturing systems departments; (ii) how they can be conveyed to operators also taking into account the cognitive load that is incurred by the operators. To this end, starting from a previous article (Longo et al., 2017), this article designs and proposes the KNOW4I approach and its practical implementation in an ICT platform (the KNOW4I platform) to further empower the Smart Operators concept. Two major objectives are pursued. The former is to set a standard referred to as the KNOW4I methodological approach for knowledge representation, knowledge management and digital contents management within the Smart Operator domain. The latter is the implementation of the aforementioned approach as part of the KNOW4I platform that includes a suite of Smart Utilities and Objects intelligently and interactively linked with a newly released version of the Sophos-MS digital and intelligent Assistant. Experimentations and results based on multiple KPIs are carried out to account for the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB  - Information support systems for coping with and mastering increasing process complexity are becoming a success factor for many companies. The information systems available today are predominantly implemented as mobile applications and, as the range of functions grows, place increasingly high demands on the user interface. To reduce the cognitive load, these are tailored to the user and are limited in functionality or require special training, which is costly and impractical for some user groups. Current voice interaction interfaces offer advantages in this context, but the communication of data to the user can be done more meaningfully and clearly in graphical or multimodal form. Furthermore, both interaction modes neglect essential sources of information in industrial and logistics use cases, such as available information about documents and physical properties of objects. Methodologically, this contribution proceeds as follows: First, a literature review was conducted on Cognitive Load Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Response Theory, and the cooperative principle of conversation with a focus on human-machine interaction. Subsequently, expert interviews on relevant application areas in the field of production and logistics were conducted in order to identify use cases and derive system requirements. Based on the findings, a concept for an stationary adaptive multimodal information system was developed, which, to our knowledge, does not exist yet due to the combination of a 2D/3D scanner and conversational intelligence and can be used to improve human-machine interaction in the context of Industry 5.0.

AB  - In the paper, an innovative approach to deal with the Mixed Model Assembly Line Balancing Problem (MALBP) with stochastic task times and parallel workstations is presented. At the current stage of research, advances in solving realistic and complex assembly line balancing problem, as the one analyzed, are often limited by the poor capability to effectively evaluate the line throughput. Although algorithms are potentially able to consider many features of realistic problems and to effectively explore the solution space, a lack of precision in their objective function evaluation (which usually includes a performance parameter, as the throughput) limits in fact their capability to find good solutions. Traditionally, algorithms use indirect measures of throughput (such as workload smoothness), that are easy to calculate, but whose correlation with the throughput is often poor, especially when the complexity of the problem increases. Algorithms are thus substantially driven towards wrong objectives. The aim of this paper is to show how a decisive step forward can be done in this filed by coupling the most recent advances of simulation techniques with a genetic algorithm approach. A parametric simulator, developed under the event/object oriented paradigm, has been embedded in a genetic algorithm for the evaluation of the objective function, which contains the simulated throughput. The results of an ample simulation study, in which the proposed approach has been compared with other two traditional approaches from the literature, demonstrate that significant improvements are obtainable.

AB  - Introduction
The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) presents a plethora of information and demands extensive knowledge and a high cognitive workload to interpret. Whilst the ECG is an important clinical tool, it is frequently incorrectly interpreted. Even expert clinicians are known to impulsively provide a diagnosis based on their first impression and often miss co-abnormalities. Given it is widely reported that there is a lack of competency in ECG interpretation, it is imperative to optimise the interpretation process. Predominantly the ECG interpretation process remains a paper based approach and whilst computer algorithms are used to assist interpreters by providing printed computerised diagnoses, there are a lack of interactive human-computer interfaces to guide and assist the interpreter.
Methods
An interactive computing system was developed to guide the decision making process of a clinician when interpreting the ECG. The system decomposes the interpretation process into a series of interactive sub-tasks and encourages the clinician to systematically interpret the ECG. We have named this model ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI) as the user cannot ‘progress’ unless they complete each sub-task. Using this model, the ECG is segmented into five parts and presented over five user interfaces (1: Rhythm interpretation, 2: Interpretation of the P-wave morphology, 3: Limb lead interpretation, 4: QRS morphology interpretation with chest lead and rhythm strip presentation and 5: Final review of 12-lead ECG). The IPI model was implemented using emerging web technologies (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, PHP and MySQL). It was hypothesised that this system would reduce the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpreters. To test this, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians when they used the standard approach (control cohort) with clinicians who interpreted the same ECGs using the IPI approach (IPI cohort).
Results
For the control cohort, the (mean; standard deviation; confidence interval) of the ECG interpretation accuracy was (45.45%; SD=18.1%; CI=42.07, 48.83). The mean ECG interpretation accuracy rate for the IPI cohort was 58.85% (SD=42.4%; CI=49.12, 68.58), which indicates a positive mean difference of 13.4%. (CI=4.45, 22.35) An N−1 Chi-square test of independence indicated a 92% chance that the IPI cohort will have a higher accuracy rate. Interpreter self-rated confidence also increased between cohorts from a mean of 4.9/10 in the control cohort to 6.8/10 in the IPI cohort (p=0.06). Whilst the IPI cohort had greater diagnostic accuracy, the duration of ECG interpretation was six times longer when compared to the control cohort.
Conclusions
We have developed a system that segments and presents the ECG across five graphical user interfaces. Results indicate that this approach improves diagnostic accuracy but with the expense of time, which is a valuable resource in medical practice.

AB  - Cognitive assistance systems can improve operators’ cognitive workload and performance in industrial work environments. To benefit from the potential of cognitive assistance requires a human-centered approach. Thus, this paper presents and evaluates an integrated process model for a human-centered design of industrial cognitive assistance systems. It considers the human-centered design process according to ISO 9241-210 over the entire product life cycle. The authors apply the process model to an industrial case study concerning developing an Augmented Reality (AR)-based assistance system to maintain wind turbines, which shows its applicability and enables further systematic development.

AB  - The 5.0 industry promotes collaborative robots (cobots). This research studies the impacts of cobot collaboration using an experimental setup. 120 participants realized a simple and a complex assembly task. 50% collaborated with another human (H/H) and 50% with a cobot (H/C). The workload and the acceptability of the cobotic collaboration were measured. Working with a cobot decreases the effect of the task complexity on the human workload and on the output quality. However, it increases the time completion and the number of gestures (while decreasing their frequency). The H/C couples have a higher chance of success but they take more time and more gestures to realize the task. The results of this research could help developers and stakeholders to understand the impacts of implementing a cobot in production chains.

AB  - In our anxiogenic and stressful world, the maintenance of an optimal cognitive performance is a constant challenge. It is particularly true in complex working environments (e.g. flight deck, air traffic control tower), where individuals have sometimes to cope with a high mental workload and stressful situations. Several models (i.e. processing efficiency theory, cognitive-energetical framework) have attempted to provide a conceptual basis on how human performance is modulated by high workload and stress/anxiety. These models predict that stress can reduce human cognitive efficiency, even in the absence of a visible impact on the task performance. Performance may be protected under stress thanks to compensatory effort, but only at the expense of a cognitive cost. Yet, the psychophysiological cost of this regulation remains unclear. We designed two experiments involving pupil diameter, cardiovascular and prefrontal oxygenation measurements. Participants performed the Toulouse N-back Task that intensively engaged both working memory and mental calculation processes under the threat (or not) of unpredictable aversive sounds. The results revealed that higher task difficulty (higher n level) degraded the performance and induced an increased tonic pupil diameter, heart rate and activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, and a decreased phasic pupil response and heart rate variability. Importantly, the condition of stress did not impact the performance, but at the expense of a psychophysiological cost as demonstrated by lower phasic pupil response, and greater heart rate and prefrontal activity. Prefrontal cortex seems to be a central region for mitigating the influence of stress because it subserves crucial functions (e.g. inhibition, working memory) that can promote the engagement of coping strategies. Overall, findings confirmed the psychophysiological cost of both mental effort and stress. Stress likely triggered increased motivation and the recruitment of additional cognitive resources that minimize its aversive effects on task performance (effectiveness), but these compensatory efforts consumed resources that caused a loss of cognitive efficiency (ratio between performance effectiveness and mental effort).

AB  - Seeing the innovative character of exoskeletal devices, it appears that there is yet progress to be made in adopting exoskeletons to industry, and to the different users’ characteristics and needs. Their validation is mainly focused on technological aspects and seldom researchers presented methodological approaches including both physical and cognitive impact on operators, synergically with functional issues. This study proposes a multi-faced approach to investigate the impact of passive exoskeletons on functional and ergonomic aspects providing a preliminary experimental validation with an industrial task. The approach assesses the physical comfort, muscular fatigue, cognitive workload, and users’ technological acceptance, to map the overall user experience (UX). Participants were monitored by a mechanomyogram (MMG) and a motion capture (MoCap) system and a UX questionnaire was administered. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of passive exoskeletons regarding the specific task being strictly related to a correct definition of the level of assistance for each user.

This study investigated the effects of alarm management and automation on process control operator workload (NASA-TLX) and performance via material lost through flaring outcomes. Eleven console qualified operators participated in a human-in-the-loop, high-fidelity simulation-based training exercise. Three levels of alarm management (no rationalization, rationalization, and state-based smart alarm) and two levels of automation (no automation and automation) conditions were implemented using six scenarios. A repeated measures two-way MANOVA indicated that both alarm management schema and automation significantly affected operator workload and performance. These results indicate that state-based smart alarm management and automation schemas may assist operators in reducing workload and material lost through flare release during abnormal operating conditions.

AB  - Flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) are crucial in contemporary manufacturing environments because they provide the required agility and adaptability to face volatile customer demands. Balancing workload among different work stations of an FMS is essential to ensure optimal resource utilization, minimize idle times, and improve overall system performance. This research is aimed to study the application of dynamic workload balancing to part input sequencing for integrated FMS scheduling decision-making. In this work, we propose an online algorithm that balances workload dynamically in FMSs. A mathematical model of FMS scheduling integration is presented. The proposed approach schedules tasks not only on machines but also on the robot responsible for part movement within a shop floor. The proposed approach is evaluated in two aspects of comparison and analysis. Data analysis is made by simulation experiment and statistical analysis. Conclusions with managerial implications for practical applications and future research suggestions are provided.

AB  - In this study, we introduce an optimization framework to enhance the efficiency of motion priority design in scenarios involving automated and teleoperated robots within an industrial recovery context. The increasing utilization of industrial robots at manufacturing sites has been instrumental in reducing human workload. Nevertheless, achieving effective human–robot collaboration/cooperation (HRC) remains a challenge, especially when human workers and robots share a workspace for collaborative tasks. For instance, when an industrial robot encounters a failure, such as dropping an assembling part, it triggers the suspension of the corresponding factory cell for safe recovery. Given the limited capacity of pre-programmed robots to rectify such failures, human intervention becomes imperative, requiring entry into the robot workspace to address the dropped object while the robot system is halted. This discontinuous manufacturing process results in productivity loss. Robotic teleoperation has emerged as a promising technology enabling human workers to undertake high-risk tasks remotely and safely. Our study advocates for the incorporation of robotic teleoperation in the recovery process during manufacturing failure scenarios, which is referred to as “Cooperative Tele-Recovery”. Our proposed approach involves formulating priority rules designed to facilitate collision avoidance between manufacturing and recovery robots. This, in turn, ensures a continuous manufacturing process with minimal production loss within a configurable risk limitation. We present a comprehensive motion priority optimization framework composed of an HRC simulator and a cooperative multi-robot controller to identify optimal parameters for the priority function. The framework dynamically adjusts the allocation of motion priorities for manufacturing and recovery robots while adhering to predefined risk limitations. Through quantitative and qualitative assessments, we validate the novelty of our concept and demonstrate its feasibility.

AB  - Although sunlight contains approximately equal amounts of near-infrared radiation (NIR) and visible light, NIR is absent from most present-day electric lighting systems and is filtered by energy-efficient windows. However, NIR is biologically active and is commonly applied in targeted photobiomodulation treatments for a range of cognitive, emotional, and physical conditions. Given the removal of NIR from indoor illumination, it is critical to understand how ambient NIR may influence psychological and physical health, and whether reduced exposure to NIR in indoor environments could be cause for concern. In a preregistered within-subjects double-blind experiment, acute effects of NIR and far-red wavelengths in ambient illumination on cognition, emotional state and cardiovascular health were examined in a sample of 151 university students (117 females, 34 males). During a 2-hour laboratory session, participants were monitored at rest and while engaged in cognitively demanding tasks across two counterbalanced lighting conditions. Both included 3500 K white light generated by a light-emitting diode (LED) system, while one additionally included LEDs with peak wavelengths in the NIR (875 nm, 960 nm) and far-red (735 nm) spectrum. The addition of NIR and far-red to the ambient lighting showed beneficial effects on resting high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), HF-HRV responses to cognitive demand, and feelings of pleasure, but reduced performance on a visual search task. These findings reveal that the absence of NIR from architectural lighting influences humans at a psychological and physiological level, with implications for health and well-being that need to be balanced with energy-saving considerations.

AB  - The European Commission defined the new concept of Industry 5.0 meaning a more human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is important to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of the operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. In this context, the paper presents a strategy to effectively assess the UX of workers to promote human-centric vision of manufacturing sites, enhancing the overall sustainability of the modern factories. A set of non-invasive wearable devices is used to monitor human activities and collect physiological parameters, as well as questionnaires to gather subjective self-assessment. This set-up was applied to virtual reality (VR) simulation, replicating heavy duty work sequence tasks that took place in an oil and gas pipes manufacturing site. This approach allowed the identification of possible stressful conditions for the operator, from physical and mental perspectives, which may compromise the performance. This research was funded by the European Community's HORIZON 2020 programme under grant agreement No. 958303 (PENELOPE).

AB  - Product personalization is the global trend driving the development of modern production systems. This in turn creates the need to deploy flexible and reconfigurable assembly systems. New type of factories exploiting the capabilities of multiple resources such as human operators and mobile and / or stationary robot assistants are emerging. This paper investigates the use of digital world modelling techniques in such hybrid production systems for enabling system reconfiguration through shared environment and process perception. The suggested digital world model infrastructure involves three main functionalities: a) Virtual representation of the shopfloor, combining multiple sensor data and CAD models. The digital shopfloor is rendered in the 3D environment exploiting the capabilities provided by Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, b) Semantic representation of the world through the implementation of a unified data model for representing the geometrical as well as the workload state, and c) Dynamic update of the digital twin based on real time sensor and resource data coming from the actual shopfloor. The communication and integration layer among the physical and the virtual agents is realized on top of the ROS framework. The developed infrastructure is applied to an industrial case study from the automotive industry focusing on a car’s front axle assembly. Nevertheless, it is designed to be generic enough to be able to address multiple cases.

AB  - Introduction
The aim of this study is to propose a model of job rotations in shoes (sandals and tennis shoes) production cells, aiming at reducing the risk exposure to work-related musculoskeletal disorders considering physical and psychological workloads.
Methods
The physical load was assessed by the Occupational Repetitive Actions method, and the psychological load by the Job Stress Scale. A total of 259 workers in the footwear industry participated in this study. These loads were incorporated into a multi-objective mathematical programming model, where the objective functions aimed to minimize the maximum work-related musculoskeletal disorders and the maximum total work demand, and to maximize the minimum work control and social support to which a worker might be exposed during a daily journey. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature that physical and psychological aspects are considered when solving job rotation problems. To tackle the problem, we propose a matheuristic based on an epsilon-constraint framework. This method allows us to generate different solutions with respect to the specific objective functions. To assess the effectiveness of the solutions, we calculated the variance of the scores of the physical and psychological loads in the conditions without and with rotations.
Results
Five rotation solutions were reached for the sandal production cells and twelve for the tennis shoe production cells. There was a reduction in the variation of physical and psychological loads in all solutions for both cells when compared to the no rotation condition. However, for the sandal production cells, the reduction in variation between the physical loads of the conditions with and without rotations was not significant due to the similarity of the exposure indices.
Conclusions
The model reduces the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, promoting variability in muscle recruitment and enrichment of work content, being applicable in other segments.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution introduced a new paradigm in manufacturing systems. The digital network is at the basis of the smart manufacturing and the physical context is strictly related to the artificial intelligence. This new manufacturing context drastically changed the role of the operator since the increasing adoption of innovative devices in manufacturing process modified the work activities and the operator is employed in more cognitive than physical tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this paper consists in developing an analytical framework to assess the human cognitive capacity occupancy and the human processing time of correct information known as the quality performance. The analytical framework presented allows to assess the human mental workload imposed by the task and how the processing speed of correct information changes when quality performance varies.

AB  - This paper aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of the affordances of Augmented Reality (AR) as a workplace-based learning and training technology in supporting manual or semi-automated manufacturing tasks that involve both complex manipulation and reasoning. Between-subject laboratory experiments involving 20 participants are conducted on a real-life electro-mechanical assembly task to investigate the impacts of various modes of information delivery through AR compared to traditional training methods on task efficiency, number of errors, learning, independence, and cognitive load. The AR application is developed in Unity and deployed on HoloLens 2 headsets. Interviews with experts from industry and academia are also conducted to create new insights into the affordances of AR as a training versus assistive tool for manufacturing workers, as well as the need for intelligent mechanisms that enable adaptive and personalized interactions between workers and AR. The findings indicate that despite comparable performance between the AR and control groups in terms of task completion time, learning curve, and independence from instructions, AR dramatically decreases the number of errors compared to traditional instruction, which is sustained after the AR support is removed. Several insights drawn from the experiments and expert interviews are discussed to inform the design of future AR technologies for both training and assisting incumbent and future manufacturing workers on complex manipulation and reasoning tasks.

AB  - In the last decades, research has claimed facial micro-expressions are a reliable means to detect deception. However, experimental results showed that trained and naïve human judges observing facial micro-expressions can distinguish liars from truth-tellers with an accuracy just slightly above the chance level. More promising results recently came from the field of artificial intelligence, in which machine learning (ML) techniques are used to identify micro-expressions and are trained to distinguish deceptive statements from genuine ones. In this paper, we test the ability of different feature extraction methods (i.e., improved dense trajectories, OpenFace) and ML techniques (i.e., support vector machines vs. deep neural networks) to distinguish liars from truth-tellers based on facial micro-expressions, using a new video data set collected in low-stakes situations. During the interviews, a technique to increase liars’ cognitive load was applied, facilitating cues of lies to emerge. Results highlighted that support vector machines (SVMs) coupled with OpenFace resulted in the best performing method (AUC = 0.72 videos without cognitive load; AUC = 0.78 videos with cognitive load). All the tested classifiers performed better when a cognitive load was imposed on the interviewee, confirming that the technique of increasing cognitive load during an interview facilitates deception recognition. In the same task, human judges obtained an accuracy of 57%. Results are discussed and compared with the previous literature, confirming that artificial intelligence performs better than humans in lie-detection tasks do, even when humans have more information to make a decision.

In the current study we created a virtual replica of a real-world, multi-level educational facility, and compared data collected in the VE vs. the real-world environment as participants completed identical navigational tasks. We found significant differences in all of the measures used, including distance covered, number of mistakes made, time for task completion, spatial memory, extent of backtracking, observation of directional signs, perceived uncertainty levels, perceived cognitive workload, and perceived task difficulty. We also analyzed potential age-related effects to look for heightened VE/real-world response discrepancies among older adult participants (age 55 or over) compared to younger adults (18–30 years of age). This analysis yielded no significant age-by-condition interaction effects. Finally, we examined the spatial distribution of self-reported wayfinding uncertainty across the building floorplan, finding that areas in which uncertainty was most pronounced were similar between the real-world and VE settings. Overall, these findings indicate that while virtual reality can be a useful design research tool, caution is needed when interpreting and generalizing its results.

AB  - A worker assignment job rotation problem with the heterogeneous workers and the jobs with different workload level is presented in this paper. Both productivity and ergonomic criteria are considered in the problem and a multi-objective mixed-integer mathematical model is proposed to implement an ergonomic job rotation in a production system. The main objective of the model is to balance the daily workload that the workers are exposed together with reducing the production cycle time in the studied system. The proposed mathematical model is applied to a part of a truck assembly line. The model is programmed by GMPL mathematical modeling language and is solved by employing Gurobi solver. The computational results show the capability of the proposed model to optimize both objectives of the job rotation.

AB  - Human and robot collaboration in assembly tasks is an integral part in modern manufactories. Robots provide advantages in both process and productivity with their repeatability and usability in different tasks, while human operators provide flexibility and can act as safeguards. However, process complexity increases which can lower the overall quality. Increased complexity can negatively influence decision making due to cognitive load on human operators, which can lead to lower quality, be it product, process or human work. Moreover, it can lead to safety risks, human-system error and accidents. In this work, we present the preliminary results on an experiment performed with student-participants, based on an assembly task. The experiment was set up to emulate an industrial assembly, and data collection was performed through qualitative and non-intrusive quantitative methods. Questionnaires were used to assess perceptual task complexity and cognitive load, while a stereo camera provided recordings for after-task analysis on process errors and human work quality based on a 3D skeleton-based human pose estimation and tracking method. The aim of the study is to investigate causes of errors and implications on quality. Future direction of the work is discussed.

AB  - Transient patterns of interregional connectivity form and dissipate in response to varying cognitive demands. Yet, it is not clear how different cognitive demands influence brain state dynamics, and whether these dynamics relate to general cognitive ability. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we characterised shared, recurrent, global brain states in 187 participants across the working memory, emotion, language, and relation tasks from the Human Connectome Project. Brain states were determined using Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA). In addition to the LEiDA-based metrics of brain state lifetimes and probabilities, we also computed information-theoretic measures of Block Decomposition Method of complexity, Lempel-Ziv complexity and transition entropy. Information theoretic metrics are notable in their ability to compute relationships amongst sequences of states over time, compared to lifetime and probability, which capture the behaviour of each state in isolation. We then related task-based brain state metrics to fluid intelligence. We observed that brain states exhibited stable topology across a range of numbers of clusters (K = 2:15). Most metrics of brain state dynamics, including state lifetime, probability, and all information theoretic metrics, reliably differed between tasks. However, relationships between state dynamic metrics and cognitive abilities varied according to the task, the metric, and the value of K, indicating that there are contextual relationships between task-dependant state dynamics and trait cognitive ability. This study provides evidence that the brain reconfigures across time in response to cognitive demands, and that there are contextual, rather than generalisable, relationships amongst task, state dynamics, and cognitive ability.

To obtain knowledge for designing age-friendly production systems, this study conducted the first characteristic analysis of elderly workers, focusing on the set parts supply process. By combining motion analysis with the subjective mental workload survey, this study clarified the differences in how tasks are performed by elderly and young workers and how such differences affect the mental workload of elderly workers. The findings enable evidence-based design and implementation of age-friendly production systems.

AB  - The increasing complexity of product varieties and productions leads to higher mental workload in the mixed-model assembly line (MMAL). Mental workload can improve product quality and guarantee the efficiency simultaneously. However, little research has been done on balancing the production quality and efficiency based on the effect of mental workload and complexity in the MMAL. This study aims to propose a mathematical model to formulate the multi-objective MMAL problem and the genetic algorithm is applied for problem solving due to the computational complexities. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that incorporating the impact of mental workload on performance into account can make the rolled throughput yield (RTY) and efficiency balance when designing the MMAL. Moreover, we also verify that improving the experience of the operators can mitigate the impact of mental workload on the quality and efficiency.

AB  - Manual assessment of laboratory exercises and assignments by human instructors is subjective and time-consuming, introducing errors, inconsistencies, and biases. A preliminary study developing an automated evaluation system utilizing computer vision has been proposed in this article to address these challenges. It utilizes computer vision to assess the accuracy and quality of components machined by students enrolled during the manufacturing laboratory course. The system includes image acquisition hardware, algorithms for objective decisions, and an interface for evaluating student performance. The system is implemented during one of the laboratory classes, and a comparative assessment is carried out with manual evaluations followed by student feedback. It has been shown that the system can address subjectivity concerns, reducing the workload on course instructors and teaching assistants. The research also broadens the utility of computer vision in manufacturing education and creates interest among enrolled students to appreciate the role of newer technologies in a core discipline.

AB  - The new Industry 5.0 paradigm complements the well-known Industry 4.0 approach by specifically driving research and innovation to facilitate the transition to sustainable, human-centric and resilient industry. In the manufacturing context, workers' diversity in terms of experience, productivity and physical capacity represents a significant challenge for companies, especially those characterized by high staff turnover and manual processes with high workload and poor ergonomics. In seeking to address such challenges, this research adopts a human-centric perspective to define new flexible job arrangements by developing a new multi-objective job rotation scheduling model. The proposed model is unique in that it aims to achieve multiple job assignment objectives by simultaneously considering different socio-technical factors: workers' experience, physical capacity and limitations, postural ergonomic risks, noise and vibration exposure, and workers' boredom. The model's implementation in real environments can be supported by new sensor-based technologies that collect data on workers' efficiency, ergonomic scores and task performance and enable workers to participate in measuring perceived fatigue and boredom. The primary goal of our model is to find the most appropriate assignment of job and individual-flexible rest-break plan for each worker. The authors test the model application in an industrial setting. Useful managerial insights emerge and prescriptive recommendations are provided.

AB  - In today’s INDUSTRY 4.0 context, the growing need to improve performances and sustainability of working environment is looking forward to developing interoperable and service-oriented systems with real time capabilities. This is boosting the installation of decentralized and reliable robotics cells with flexible cooperative capabilities. They enroll smart operators’flexibility and robot productivity in collaborative robotics (properly cobots) applications. This paper consists of a state-of-the-art review on cognitive load in manufacturing with characterization of human-robot collaboration. A simulated analysis of a collaborative working cell is performed. An Agent Based (AB) model is presented with application in the automotive sector. The cell consists of logistics AGVs equipped with a manipulator. They interact with working robots and human operator. Robots collaborate in cell and they cooperate with operator on assisted task using Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). The load of human in the collaborative work-cell– set on state of art - is measured according with Functional states over different Behavioral Structures (FBS). We quantified the load of cognitive factors while reporting interaction analysis. Some factors as age and interface complexity and recovery strategy are investigated while reporting their effect on a dynamic variable, i.e., physical stress properly fatigue. This acts on productivity and operational outcomes.

AB  - An immersive Augmented Reality (AR) technology enhances productivity and flexibility in manufacturing by providing real-time instructions within workers’ field of view, aiding in complex tasks. According to cognitive load and attention-based theories, AR guidance can reduce cognitive strain, enhancing task performance. The affordance of AR in industrial processes like assembly or disassembly for repair/maintenance has been exploited broadly. However, the prevailing studies on automated user interfaces for AR instruction development, specifically virtual scene creation and target generation for object mapping rendering, still need to be explored. Notably, production industries currently rely on outsourcing skilled professionals to create AR overlaying instructions using manufacturer input. However, the exactness of the disassembly repository is substantial to avoid defects in AR guidance particulars. This underscores the significance of generalized automated AR instruction development and emphasizes the demands for further research. In this work, the autonomous AR-integrated framework is developed for the disassembly context, empowering manufacturers to acquire desired outcomes across various modules. These modules include the validation of the manual user disassembly sequence repository during the prefatory phase of AR instruction creation and the provision of Disassembly Sequence Planning (DSP) input. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation/rendering of disassembly efforts in a virtual platform and the generation of rendering virtual display scenes for appropriate AR-guided object mapping. Furthermore, it enables the generation of essential model targets for registering the AR scenes. Subsequently, the extracted repositories (virtual scenes and model targets) are input into the Unity AR tool to create AR mapping guidance for disassembly operations. The performance of the autonomous disassembly module is evaluated through three case studies with different AR visualizations. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed framework is exploited by extracting feedback from experts regarding flexibility, compatibility, completion time, and cognitive level.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of psychosocial safety climate (PSC) and its relationship to work-related outcome (i.e., work engagement) via working conditions such as job demands and resources. Specifically, by using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a basis of the argument, the research examines how cognitive demands and possibilities for development mediate the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and work engagement. The research predicted that PSC positively increases work engagement via enhancement of positive demands (i.e., cognitive demands) and possibilities for development. The current study utilized a cross-sectional survey approach among 392 employees in one oil and gas organization in Malaysia. To test the research hypotheses, data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM). The study revealed that PSC increased possibilities for development and had no significant relationship with cognitive demands. Furthermore, the results supported the notion that working condition (possibilities for development) mediated the relationship between PSC and work engagement. Overall, these findings suggest that PSC plays a significant role as predictor for working conditions and work outcomes in oil and gas industry. The results may be used to help occupational health and safety practitioners, human resource practitioners and higher management within organizations to understand how PSC influences working conditions and work outcomes.

AB  - Night-time conditions are one of the most complex driving situations due to limited availability of visual information in the environment and limitations to the human visual system. In such conditions, road markings and road signs are the main source of information for drivers. Research has shown that road markings and road signs, if properly designed and placed, can positively impact driver behaviour and thus overall road safety. However, it is still not completely clear how different levels of road markings and road signs visibility affect drivers in night-time conditions. For this reason, we used a driving simulator to simulate night-time conditions and different levels of visibility of road markings and road signs in order to analyse the connection between the visibility of these road elements and driver behaviour and cognitive load. The results suggest that the level of road markings and road signs visibility slight increased the driving speed (about 2%), but at the same time it had a positive effect on participants’ cognitive load which was at an optimal level during high visibility. Although there was no significant difference in participants’ eye movements and the number of gazes at road markings, the percentage share of looked road signs was the highest in high visibility conditions, which suggests that the participants were in most cases timely informed and aware of the upcoming situation.

AB  - The emerging concept of Industry 5.0 has led industries to design industrial environments integrating robots to support human work. The impact of implementing human-robot interaction (HRI) on humans and the work-related stress linked to it is still an open issue. In this context, measuring mental stress is crucial for designing effective HRI environments. This study aims to experimentally test the influence of the robot's presence on mental stress by measuring humans' performance, physiological data, and workload perception. Sixty participants were asked to perform an assembly task while coexisting with a robot. Three scenarios were tested, changing the kind of task performed by the robot and the distance from the participants' working area. Statistical analyses were performed to capture the differences between scenarios. Results show that the robot's presence does not significantly affect the participants' stress levels. However, when the distance to the robot decreases, human performance is affected, concluding that the robot's proximity could cause more distraction to human workers.

AB  - The assembly of large and complex products as cars typically involves a huge amount of production resources as workers, pieces of equipment and layout areas. Multi-manned workstations commonly characterize these assembly lines along with some additional features such as compatibility/incompatibility between the different mounting positions, equipment sharing and worker cooperation. The simultaneous management of all such aspects significantly increases the balancing problem complexity. This paper proposes a new mixed integer programming model for such multi-manned assembly line synchronization problem to simultaneously optimize the line efficiency, the line length and the workload smoothness. A customized procedure based on a simulated annealing algorithm is developed to effectively solve this problem. The aforementioned procedure is validated through an industrial case study of an Italian sports car manufacturer distinguished by 665 tasks and numerous synchronization constraints typical of real assembly lines.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the antecedents of organizational commitment and turnover intentions among apparel manufacturing workers, specifically focusing on the moderating effects of creative behavior and instrumental readiness. Employing the Expectancy– Confirmation Theory, this study conveniently sampled 393 apparel workers from four free zone exporting firms to gather data. The collected data was analyzed using regression in STATA 14. The study revealed that, although workers were not overburdened with workload, factors such as skills obsolescence, entrepreneurship intention, fairness and rewards had predictive effects on their organizational commitment and turnover intentions. Additionally, the study found that creative behavior and instrumental readiness moderated the relationship between entrepreneurship intention and turnover intention. Given the recent adverse impact of inflation on the economic value of workers' wages and the uncertainty stemming from operational changes regarding skills obsolescence, the study provides valuable insights into how these factors may influence workers’ organizational commitment and turnover intentions. The study contributes important insights into contextualizing and examining turnover and organizational commitment within the apparel manufacturing industry using the hypothesized model developed in the context of the Expectancy-Confirmation Theory.

AB  - Objective
Healthcare institutions worldwide are moving to electronic health records (EHRs). These transitions are particularly numerous in the US where healthcare systems are purchasing and implementing commercial EHRs to fulfill federal requirements. Despite the central role of EHRs to workflow, the cognitive impact of these transitions on the workforce has not been widely studied. This study assesses the changes in cognitive workload among pediatric nurses during data entry and retrieval tasks during transition from a hybrid electronic and paper information system to a commercial EHR.
Materials and methods
Baseline demographics and computer attitude and skills scores were obtained from 74 pediatric nurses in two wards. They also completed an established and validated instrument, the NASA-TLX, that is designed to measure cognitive workload; this instrument was used to evaluate cognitive workload of data entry and retrieval. The NASA-TLX was administered at baseline (pre-implementation), 1, 5 and 10 shifts and 4 months post-implementation of the new EHR.
Results
Most nurse participants experienced significant increases of cognitive workload at 1 and 5 shifts after “go-live”. These increases abated at differing rates predicted by participants’ computer attitudes scores (p=0.01).
Conclusions
There is substantially increased cognitive workload for nurses during the early phases (1–5 shifts) of EHR transitions. Health systems should anticipate variability across workers adapting to “meaningful use” EHRs. “One-size-fits-all” training strategies may not be suitable and longer periods of technical support may be necessary for some workers.

AB  - Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are among the top factors impacting the individual’s performance and the overall company’s productivity. Virtual Reality (VR) has enabled proactive consideration of human factors. However, there are still barriers impeding the broader adoption of human-in-the-loop approaches, including the number and roles of people involved in simulation stages and the complexity of modelling lengthy task sequences. This paper presents a multi-user immersive VR simulation framework for collaborative human-centered task evaluation involving engineers and operators. The software architecture enabling multi-user VR sessions is discussed, together with a hierarchical approach for modelling complex manufacturing tasks in VR applications and collecting structured data from the simulations. Metrics such as heatmap and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment are integrated for informed decision-making about task redesign. The proposed approach was tested in a case study inspired by large parts manufacturing, where operators need to work in teams. The server-client network enabled the engineer to comprehensively assess the design of the task having two operators executing virtual actions in parallel as they would in the actual workstation. The collection of data from the team of operators and their intuitive visualization enhanced the effectiveness in identifying aspects introducing discomfort and assessing the overall suitability of the design for human operators.

AB  - Cognitive function of human brain requires temporal execution of emotional or attentional tasks, or their inter-dependence influences. Smooth execution of such tasks requires spontaneous distribution of cognitive load at specific regions of brain based on its classification. A strong connectivity between peripheral sensors and central nervous system is thought to assist the cognitive load distribution effectively. Novelty of current study evaluates the modulation of foot pressure and its mapping with distributed cognitive load while executing attentional biased emotional tasks. Emotional stimulus in form of happy and sad faces with attentional paradigm drawn on them were used in the study. Behavioral results were measured with respect to the analysis of response time (RT) and response accuracy (%). Neurological signals were acquired using 10-channel EEG data acquisition system, whereas, another 6 channels were used to measure foot pressure in the left and right feet at three different locations of foot. Acquired signals were further analyzed in time and frequency domains to interpret the cognitive load distribution, and the influence of foot pressure on distribution of cognitive loads. We found that the foot pressure accelerated the response accuracy rate in attending the local scope of attention, which was not in the case of global scope of attention. This means that the global attention does not require any pressure from peripheral sensory neurons. Our event related potential (ERP) results revealed that the early sensory negative N100 characterized the processing of global scope of attention coupled with high-foot pressure. However, the late positive peak of P300 and P600 associated with local scope of attention along with high-foot pressure. The global scope of attention with low-foot pressure modulates delta and theta oscillations. These results largely contribute to the literature on cognitive neuroscience of attention and it corelation with the peripheral sensory foot pressure.

AB  - Biomechanical analyses recognize the role of cognitive loads in postural stability by measuring body sway related parameters. However, the simultaneous investigation of the neural and motor behavior during control of the posture is limited. The present study investigated the effects of cognitive load addition on postural control and status of topographical brain activity in quiet and perturbed standing. Sixteen healthy young people participated in four main levels of the experiment, including two levels of physical difficulty with and without math questions in the form of mental calculations. Cortical electrical activity and postural sways were recorded simultaneously using a 19-channel electroencephalography and motion analysis method to measure body movements by a high-speed camera and active markers. Analysis of variance showed significant effects of the cognitive perturbation on theta band energy of the frontal (p < .001) and temporal (p = .030) regions. Approximate entropy metrics of the brain frontal activity and also the movements of the center of mass were reduced by cognitive loads (p < .05). The energy of theta band EEG signals was positively correlated to the overall mechanical work in easier tasks (r = 0.59), and the CoM stability metrics in the more difficult tasks (r > 0.57). Addition of the cognitive loads to a postural task reduced the stability by higher levels of brain cortex involvement. Addition of the second cognitive task to standing reduced the complexity of both neural and motor activities. The neuro-motor collaboration in maintenance of balance was interfered with the arithmetic cognitive loads.

AB  - This paper presents a hierarchical heuristic to balance the workloads among multiple identical high-speed revolver-head gantry-type surface mount technology (SMT) machines in a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly line. The nozzle assignment, the component allocation, and the single machine optimization decisions are made with the objective of minimizing the assembly cycle time. An integer programming mathematical model is developed, and a deterministic hierarchical heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this NP-hard problem efficiently. The experiment results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm reduces the cycle time by 6.94% on average compared to the industrial solutions.

AB  - We study a paced assembly line intended for manufacturing different products. Workers with identical skills perform non-preemptable operations whose assignment to stations is known. Operations assigned to the same station are executed sequentially, and they should follow the given precedence relations. Operations assigned to different stations can be performed in parallel. The operation’s processing time depends on the number of workers performing this operation. The problem consists in assigning workers to operations such that the maximal number of workers employed simultaneously in the assembly line is minimized, the line cycle time is not exceeded and the box constraints specifying the possible number of workers for each operation are not violated. We show that the general problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, develop conventional and randomized heuristics, propose a reduction to a series of feasibility problems, present a MILP model for the feasibility problem, show relation of the feasibility problem to multi-mode project scheduling and multiprocessor scheduling, establish computational complexity of several special cases based on this relation and provide computer experiments with real and simulated data.

AB  - The development of the industry phase from 4.0 into 5.0 is shifting the focus from technology-driven to value-driven to empower and engage humans in the work environment with greater influence and responsibility. This means that it is necessary to know how humans perceive collaborative work, which resulted from a shift from traditional work. Capturing the physiological conditions of humans in support of device development has shown promise in terms of the flexibility and broader scope of data in the wearable device system. In this study, the human mental workload is evaluated via physiological feedback using wearable sensors in a quantitative approach to recognize the human workload perception in the Human–robot collaboration (HRC). The physiological feedback is used to evaluate the mental workload with a classification approach utilizing supervised machine learning algorithms. The results show that, by using a random forest algorithm which selects features according to information gain, the accuracy of classifying the mental workload can be as high as 94% in the testing phase. Thus, the mental workload perceived by the operator can be estimated from physiological parameters. This finding can support Industry 5.0 applications in human–robot collaboration with a human-centric approach.

AB  - Two experiments compared the effects of learning by drawing to studying instructor-provided visuals on learning outcomes, learning time, and cognitive load. College students studied a text on the human circulatory system and completed comprehension and transfer tests. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), students studied the text with provided visuals (provided visuals) or generated their own drawings from the text with text-based support (verbally-supported drawing) or without support (unsupported drawing). Results showed that while the verbally-supported drawing condition spent significantly more time and experienced significantly higher cognitive load than the provided visuals condition, there were no differences across the three conditions in learning outcomes. In Experiment 2 (N = 85), students studied the text with provided visuals (provided visuals) or generated drawings from the text with provided visuals as feedback (visually-supported drawing). Results showed that the visually-supported drawing condition spent significantly more time and experienced significantly higher cognitive load than the provided visuals condition but also performed significantly better than the provided visuals condition on the comprehension test. These findings suggest generating drawings prior to studying provided visuals is worth the time and effort.

AB  - Manufacturing flexibility has become a competitive strategy to deal with market uncertainty. The application of advanced automation technology in manufacturing systems has tremendously increased manufacturing flexibility; however, this creates significant mental pressure for operators who must deal with a series of decisions, and this decreases their job satisfaction. In this study, we primarily investigated how cognitive automation and mechanical automaton in the material handling system affect manufacturing flexibility. Cognitive automation is defined as a computerized system that provides relevant information to operators, thereby reducing the cognitive workload; mechanical automation refers to an automated system to reduce the physical workload. The case of a truck-body production line of a truck company was investigated by applying modified DYNAMO++ for the material handling system. Then, a simulation program, AnyLogic 6.9.0 was used to investigate the effect of the cognitive and mechanical automation in the material handling system on manufacturing flexibility. The research results showed that the levels of cognitive and mechanical automation of the material handling system were increased by 52.4% and 48.0%, respectively, which resulted in improving manufacturing flexibility by 14.2% in cycle time, 53.3% in downtime, and 26.3% in the number of tasks. Cognitive automation, in particular, contributed total improvements in cycle time and downtime of 64.2% and 74.1%, respectively, which showed that cognitive automation has a very critical effect on manufacturing flexibility in the material handling system.
