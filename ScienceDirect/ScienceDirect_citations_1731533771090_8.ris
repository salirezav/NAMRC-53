AB  - Ergonomic interventions such as increased scheduled breaks or job rotation have been proposed to reduce upper limb muscle fatigue in repetitive low-load work. This review was performed to summarize and analyze the studies investigating the effect of job rotation and work-rest schemes, as well as, work pace, cycle time and duty cycle, on upper limb muscle fatigue. The effects of these work organization factors on subjective fatigue or discomfort were also analyzed. This review was based on relevant articles published in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The studies included in this review were performed in humans and assessed muscle fatigue in upper limbs. 14 articles were included in the systematic review. Few studies were performed in a real work environment and the most common methods used to assess muscle fatigue were surface electromyography (EMG). No consistent results were found related to the effects of job rotation on muscle activity and subjective measurements of fatigue. Rest breaks had some positive effects, particularly in perceived discomfort. The increase in work pace reveals a higher muscular load in specific muscles. The duration of experiments and characteristics of participants appear to be the factors that most have influenced the results. Future research should be focused on the improvement of the experimental protocols and instrumentation, in order to the outcomes represent adequately the actual working conditions.
Relevance to industry
Introducing more physical workload variation in low-load repetitive work is considered an effective ergonomic intervention against muscle fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders in industry. Results will be useful to identify the need of future research, which will eventually lead to the adoption of best industrial work practices according to the workers capabilities.

AB  - Introduction
It is important to evaluate when and why the mental workload of operators increases during system operation. The city traffic control center (TCC) is a complex work system, and it is important to describe MW as a condition related to this. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mental workload of operators while monitoring traffic loads in the city TCC.
Methods
Electroencephalography and electrooculography data were collected from 16 operators while performing their daily work, in four conditions: resting state, low traffic density, high traffic density, and recovery. The Simplified-Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (S-SWAT) was used to evaluate the subjective workload of operators.
Results
The findings indicate that operators experience a larger mental workload during high traffic density than during low traffic density (p < 0.001). TCC stressors led to significant changes in EEG bands, such as theta, alpha, and eye activity. Significant differences were observed for subjective ratings of MW (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Although the working situations of TCC operators are repeated daily, their mental fatigue and stress level gradually increase, leading to deterioration in their mental health. It may be necessary periodically to monitor their mental health and to consider their organizational behavior during traffic density monitoring.
Relevance to industry
complex work systems have increased the requirement for many operators to conduct mental tasks in real work conditions such as city traffic density monitoring. When evaluating such workplaces, it is important to identify situations requiring increased mental workload that might impose additional stress on operators, decreasing their performance. Based on the results, the traffic control center director would be aware of the MW condition of the operators.

AB  - Employing case studies taken from work experience in the UK, USA, Canada and Japan this paper observes the evolution of Human Factors (HF) and ergonomics in the railroad from a practitioner's point of view. Practical areas for application of HF at specific points in railroad signaling and control systems are described. HF considerations in advanced train control systems and the movement towards automation are discussed as well as the impact of these new technologies on the context of operation itself. There is now a greater reliance on the operator to remain vigilant and react efficiently when intervention on automation is required both within the control room and driver cab environments. This paper illustrates some of the human performance concerns for novel transportation control systems that are faced today and discusses how this area of cognitive attention, human error and workload is difficult to assess and predict.

AB  - The primary aim of image-based virtual try-on is to seamlessly deform the target garment image to align with the human body. Owing to the inherent non-rigid nature of garments, current methods prioritise flexible deformation through appearance flow with high degrees of freedom. However, existing appearance flow estimation methods solely focus on the correlation of local feature information. While this strategy successfully avoids the extensive computational effort associated with the direct computation of the global information correlation of feature maps, it leads to challenges in garments adapting to large deformation scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose the GIC-Flow framework, which obtains appearance flow by calculating the global information correlation while reducing computational regression. Specifically, our proposed global streak information matching module is designed to decompose the appearance flow into horizontal and vertical vectors, effectively propagating global information in both directions. This innovative approach considerably diminishes computational requirements, contributing to an enhanced and efficient process. In addition, to ensure the accurate deformation of local texture in garments, we propose the local aggregate information matching module to aggregate information from the nearest neighbours before computing the global correlation and to enhance weak semantic information. Comprehensive experiments conducted using our method on the VITON and VITON-HD datasets show that GIC-Flow outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in cases involving complex garment deformation.

AB  - Disorders in the musculoskeletal system are currently the most common illnesses reported by physical workers. This paper presents the possibility of improving safety conditions for vehicle and machine operators by the adjustment of a steering panel to their individual anthropometric features. These results can be used in the workstation-designing phase. When driving a tractor for a long time, the position of the human body influences the working comfort and can lead to disorders. To assess the working comfort on a mobile workstation as well as a farm tractor, surface electromyography was used. Based on the given parameter maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), the lowest workload for the forearm, arm and wrist was determined, considering the position of the steering column and the angle between arm and forearm (elbow angle). Experimental tests showed that the most comfortable position for a driver's hands was recorded when the tested elbow angle was 100°, as well as when the inclination angle of the steering column against the horizontal plane was approximately 50°. In this study, the MVC parameter was determined on the basis of muscle tension amplitude related to the maximum muscle isometric contraction. Based on this parameter, the percentage of developed force of tested muscle in relation to its maximum force-generating capabilities was described. This approach helped to define a relationship between human body position and generated load in human muscles.

AB  - Example-based learning is an effective instructional strategy for students with low prior knowledge, and is increasingly being used in online learning environments. However, examples can take many different forms and little is known about whether and how form affects learning outcomes. Therefore, this study investigated whether worked examples and modeling examples with and without a visible model would be equally effective in fostering learning of a problem-solving task. In Experiment 1, secondary education students (N=78) learned how to solve a probability calculation problem by watching two videos that, depending on the assigned condition, provided worked examples (written text, pictures of problem states), modeling examples with a visible model (spoken text, a demonstration of the task), or modeling examples without a visible model (spoken text, pictures of problem states). Results showed that all three conditions were equally effective at fostering learning, near transfer, effort reduction, self-efficacy, and perceived competence. Experiment 2 (N=134) replicated these results with a younger student population that only studied one example. These findings suggest that the format of examples does not affect learning outcomes for this task; future research should investigate whether this would generalize to other problem-solving tasks.

AB  - Public transport systems are vital services in urban environments. The design of these complex socio-technical systems is continuously evolving to accommodate larger populations, and their adaptation is essential in supporting the successful and sustainable development of cities and regions. An essential part of this adaptation includes working to increase passenger safety and to minimise their risk of injury. With this focus, key objectives of the current study were to identify the causes of slip, trip and fall (STF) incidents attributable to the rail user and to train and station characteristics. An investigation of historical STF records of 1247 train and station incidents in two Australian jurisdictions was conducted. Various contributing factors to STF events were identified, including locations such as stairs, ramps, escalators, the train's entry and exit step, doorway areas, and passenger running or rushing. A mixed-method field study was then conducted at three train stations and on trains. To further investigate the contributing factors, participants (N = 40) wore an eye tracker as they navigated the stations and trains. The research illustrates that their continuous search for information, and a disconnect between the information needed and the information provided, might be a cause of passenger distraction and an increase in their risky behaviour. Therefore, we suggest that improvements in information design to reduce the high visual workload for passengers might also reduce the incidence of STFs.

AB  - Mass producing items using three-dimensional (3D) printing is challenging. This study exploits this technology for mass production by developing an agile and ubiquitous additive manufacturing system based on 3D printing. The proposed system receives an order and then distributes the order among multiple 3D printing facilities to minimize the makespan (i.e., cycle time). A decision-making model was also constructed for distributing the order to multiple 3D printing facilities to minimize the makespan, and an algorithm was developed to solve the model. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was evaluated through an experiment. The experimental results showed that the proposed methodology reduced the cycle time by 54 min on average. Additionally, it could also distribute orders and balance the workloads of multiple 3D printing facilities. The proposed system is an industrial Internet of things–based technology that coordinates multiple distributed 3D printing facilities via the Internet. Its application to the mass production of 3D-printed items is efficient and economical.

AB  - Industrial alarm systems are very critical for the efficient and safe operation and control of plants. Alarms are used to inform the operator about possible process deviations from the normal so that the operator can take appropriate corrective action. Alarm activation and the corresponding response from the operator together serve as one of the critical layers of protection during the occurrence of a process fault. With the rapid advancement in control systems technology over the past few decades, the number of process sensors deployed for a particular plant has dramatically increased. In addition, due to the ease in configuring the alarms in control systems, the number of alarms in a plant has also gone up. This has led to poor system performance, increase in the operator workload due to alarm overload, and catastrophic incidents in some cases. This review paper discusses such issues, provides details about the existing regulations, standards and guidelines, and challenges related to alarm management. In addition, it summarizes some of the open research problems in the area of effective alarm management.

AB  - Automated decision aids typically improve decision-making, but incorrect advice risks automation misuse or disuse. We examined the novel question of whether increased automation transparency improves the accuracy of automation use under conditions with/without concurrent (non-automated assisted) task demands. Participants completed an uninhabited vehicle (UV) management task whereby they assigned the best UV to complete missions. Automation advised the best UV but was not always correct. Concurrent non-automated task demands decreased the accuracy of automation use, and increased decision time and perceived workload. With no concurrent task demands, increased transparency which provided more information on how the automation made decisions, improved the accuracy of automation use. With concurrent task demands, increased transparency led to higher trust ratings, faster decisions, and a bias towards agreeing with automation. These outcomes indicate increased reliance on highly transparent automation under conditions with concurrent task demands and have potential implications for human-automation teaming design.

AB  - Head Mounted Display (HMD) based Augmented Reality (AR) is being increasingly used in manufacturing and maintenance. However, limited research has been done to understand user interaction with AR interfaces, which may lead to poor usability, risk of occupational hazards, and low acceptance of AR systems. This paper uses a theoretically-driven approach to interaction design to investigate the impact of different AR modalities in terms of information mode (i.e. video vs. 3D animation) and interaction modality (i.e. hand-gesture vs. voice command) on user performance, workload, eye gaze behaviours, and usability during a maintenance assembly task. The results show that different information modes have distinct impacts compared to paper-based maintenance, in particular, 3D animation led to a 14% improvement over the video instructions in task completion time. Moreover, insights from eye gaze behaviours such as number of fixations and transition between Areas of Interest (AOIs) revealed the differences in attention switching and task comprehension difficulty with the choice of AR modalities. While, subjective user perceptions highlight some ergonomic issues such as misguidance and overreliance, which must be considered and addressed from the joint cognitive systems’ (JCSs) perspective and in line with the predictions derived from the Multiple Resources Model.

AB  - Cutter suction dredgers (CSDs) play a very important role in the construction of ports, waterways and navigational channels. Currently, most of CSDs are mainly manipulated by human operators, and a large amount of instrument data needs to be monitored in real time in case of unforeseen accidents. In order to reduce the heavy workload of the operators, we propose a data-driven offline learning approach, named Preprocessing-Prediction-Learning Control (PPLC), for obtaining the optimal control policy of the excavating operation of CSDs. The proposed framework consists of three modules, i.e., a data preprocessing module, a dynamics prediction module realized by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a deep reinforcement learning based control module. The first module is responsible for filtering out irrelevant variables through correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction of raw data. The second module works as a state transition function that provides the dynamics prediction of the excavating operation of a CSD. To realize the learning control, the third module employs the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to control the swing speed during the excavating operation. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can provide an effective and reliable solution to the automated excavating control of a CSD.

AB  - During the last decades the shipping industry has undergone rapid technical developments and experienced hard economic conditions and increased striving for profitability. This has led to reduced staffing and changes in task performance, which has been reported to increase workload for the remaining seafarers. The working conditions on board have a number of distinct and in many ways unique characteristics, which makes the job demands and resources for seafarers unique in several ways. The purpose of this study was to assess how engine room staff perceives how these major technical and organizational changes in the shipping industry have affected job demands as well as resources. The study compiled individual interviews and focus groups interviews with engine crew members where they were asked to elaborate on the psychosocial work environment and the major changes in the working conditions on board. Engine crew describes a work situation where they feel a lack of resources. The content of the work has changed, staffing has been reduced, new tasks are being added but the organization of the crew and the design of the work place remains unaltered.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present a practical solution to a particular real-life problem of discrete flow control in a manufacturing system. For this purpose a fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, which is an extension of the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) approach using Ordered Fuzzy Numbers (OFNs), is used. The paper includes a case study of the application of this method as a flow controller for the transport trolley in a flexible manufacturing system. The immediate aim of control is to choose the transport trolley’s destination (production line). A set of criteria (parameters) for the evaluation of the flow’s destination is suggested, related to time efficiency and equal workload of machines. The advantage of the proposed method is its ability to distinguish the type of criteria (benefit, cost) by using the orientation of ordered fuzzy numbers. An example of calculations using the presented method is shown and the results of the method, based on the simulation of a manufacturing system, are presented. The results thus obtained are compatible with flexible automation. In order to test the FTOPSIS method with OFNs the proposed flow control method is compared with the TOPSIS method and other simple control methods (dispatching rules). The proposed method is more efficient than the methods used for comparison and can be effective and efficient for diversified production and fast, automatic changeovers on production lines.

AB  - Transfer learning has proved to be effective for building predictive models even in complex conditions with a low amount of available labeled data, by constructing a predictive model for a target domain also using the knowledge coming from a separate domain, called source domain. However, several existing transfer learning methods assume identical feature spaces between the source and the target domains. This assumption limits the possible real-world applications of such methods, since two separate, although related, domains could be described by totally different feature spaces. Heterogeneous transfer learning methods aim to overcome this limitation, but they usually i) make other assumptions on the features, such as requiring the same number of features, ii) are not generally able to distribute the workload over multiple computational nodes, iii) cannot work in the Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning setting, which we also considered in this study, or iv) their applicability is limited to specific application domains, i.e., they are not general-purpose methods. In this manuscript, we present a novel distributed heterogeneous transfer learning method, implemented in Apache Spark, that overcomes all the above-mentioned limitations. Specifically, it is able to work also in the PU learning setting by resorting to a clustering-based approach, and can align totally heterogeneous feature spaces, without exploiting peculiarities of specific application domains. Moreover, our distributed approach allows us to process large source and target datasets. Our experimental evaluation was performed in three different application domains that can benefit from transfer learning approaches, namely the reconstruction of the human gene regulatory network, the prediction of cerebral stroke in hospital patients, and the prediction of customer energy consumption in power grids. The results show that the proposed approach is able to outperform 4 state-of-the-art heterogeneous transfer learning approaches and 3 baselines, and exhibits ideal performances in terms of scalability.

AB  - The purpose was to evaluate vascular hemodynamics in the forearm of fourteen healthy men over a seven-hour workday of repetitive work at and above their acceptable workload. Participants performed an ulnar deviation task at a frequency of 15 repetitions per minute for seven hours: at their psychophysically chosen acceptable torque (day 1), and at 25% above the acceptable torque (day 2). Hemodynamic responses (Tissue oxygenation index [TOI] and Tissue Hemoglobin Index [THI]) from the carpi ulnaris flexor and extensor muscle regions of the right hand were collected for the last 5 min of every hour of task performance. Participants selected their acceptable torque as 3.97 ± 2.5 N.m. (minimum: 1.0 and maximum: 9.8 N.m.). During task performance from 1 to 7 h, both tissue hemodynamic responses were not influenced by increasing the workload to above their acceptable level (P > 0.05). Therefore, increasing the acceptable load by 25% will not diminish the adequate supply and delivery of oxygen to the muscle regions recruited. When blood flow to the forearm was occluded (for 1 min) immediately after the final repetition of the seven-hour task, the half-time recovery, a noninvasive indicator of muscle oxidative capacity, was not significantly different between workloads (average TOI: 10.2 s at the acceptable workload versus 10.8 s at 25% above the acceptable workload, P > 0.05; and average THI: 10.1 s at the acceptable workload versus 10.0 s at 25% above the acceptable workload, P > 0.05). This is a remarkable finding as we hypothesized that recovery in each muscle might be longer for a workload that is greater than the acceptable level for an individual. The fact that hemodynamic responses were also similar during recovery from the task performance across both workloads imply the protectiveness of the psychophysical approach in assessing the physical ability of workers without anoxia or tissue hypoxia, thereby posing no injury to the muscles recruited.
Relevance to industry
Scientific discipline of “Psychophysics” has been instrumental in developing safe levels of workload to workers exposed to variety of occupational activities without risking injury or adverse health effects. The present optical spectroscopy-related study is an excellent example of integrating two scientific disciplines: Psychophysics and Work physiology in examining the influence of a seven-hour repetitive work exposure on muscle hemodynamics of the upper extremity.

KW  - Uncertainty quantification

KW  - Reliability
AB  - One of the major issues that car manufacturers are facing is the noise and vibration of brake systems. Of the different sorts of noise and vibration, which a brake system may generate, squeal as an irritating high-frequency noise costs the manufacturers significantly. Despite considerable research that has been conducted on brake squeal, the root cause of squeal is still not fully understood. The most common assumption, however, is mode-coupling. Complex eigenvalue analysis is the most widely used approach to the analysis of brake squeal problems. One of the major drawbacks of this technique, nevertheless, is that the effects of variability and uncertainty are not included in the results. Apparently, uncertainty and variability are two inseparable parts of any brake system. Uncertainty is mainly caused by friction, contact, wear and thermal effects while variability mostly stems from the manufacturing process, material properties and component geometries. Evaluating the effects of uncertainty and variability in the complex eigenvalue analysis improves the predictability of noise propensity and helps produce a more robust design. The biggest hurdle in the uncertainty analysis of brake systems is the computational cost and time. Most uncertainty analysis techniques rely on the results of many deterministic analyses. A full finite element model of a brake system typically consists of millions of degrees-of-freedom and many load cases. Running time of such models is so long that automotive industry is reluctant to do many deterministic analyses. This paper, instead, proposes an efficient method of uncertainty propagation via surrogate modelling. A surrogate model of a brake system is constructed in order to reproduce the outputs of the large-scale finite element model and overcome the issue of computational workloads. The probability distribution of the real part of an unstable mode can then be obtained by using the surrogate model with a massive saving of computational time and cost. The established model can be used subsequently for design, reliability analysis and optimisation.

AB  - A comprehensive literature review is conducted on the considerations of the human finger and Chinese character in finger interaction for Chinese input. The results of this study indicate the importance and influences of characteristics of the human finger and Chinese characters on Chinese handwriting. Moreover, fifteen design guidelines are developed based on the literature review to improve the Chinese handwriting performance (i.e. input time, accuracy, error rate, mental workload, satisfaction and physical fatigue) and subjective ratings. Seven guidelines are developed regarding properties of the human finger (i.e. finger size, contact area, motor skill, texture perception and input position). Another eight guidelines are related to characteristics of Chinese characters (i.e. direction, structure, script style, complexity and semantics). These results are in great help of improving the Chinese handwriting performance and user experience. The guidelines are going to help product designers develop a user-friendly Chinese handwriting system.
Relevance to industry
The literature review results give the theoretical support on developing a user-friendly Chinese handwriting system. Fifteen practical design guidelines based on the literature review are beneficial to improving handwriting performance and subjective ratings and consequently product design.

AB  - Agent transparency has been proposed as a solution to the problem of facilitating operators’ situation awareness in human-robot teams. Sixty participants performed a dual monitoring task, monitoring both an intelligent, autonomous robot teammate and performing threat detection in a virtual environment. The robot displayed four different interfaces, corresponding to information from the Situation awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) model. Participants’ situation awareness of the robot, confidence in their situation awareness, trust in the robot, workload, cognitive processing, and perceived usability of the robot displays were assessed. Results indicate that participants using interfaces corresponding to higher SAT level had greater situation awareness, cognitive processing, and trust in the robot than when they viewed lower level SAT interfaces. No differences in workload or perceived usability of the display were detected. Based on these findings, we observed that transparency has a significant effect on situation awareness, trust, and cognitive processing.

AB  - Objectives
Physical exercise has benefits that go beyond health and well-being, namely in cognitive, motor and psychophysiological areas. The discovery of a shared neural network between action observation and execution (Action-Observation Network) led us to hypothesize that watching human motor action might improve cognitive and motor aspects of performance and proneness for exercise.
Design/Methods
Sixty participants viewed a Motor (M) (n = 30) or a Non-Motor (NM) (n = 30) movie with strong or weak content of motoric features of human action, respectively. Performance in d2 Attention test, Fitts' Motor task, and a Proneness for Exercise Visual Analog Scale was assessed before and after movie visualization, in a cross-sectional study. Psychophysiological measures were recorded throughout the experiment.
Results
Our results demonstrate an increase in proneness for exercise, and greater improvement in attention-related cognitive aspects in the M group. The aforementioned benefits of action observation did not modulate motor performance. A mental effort deployment was associated to the decrease in heart rate variability after visualization of the NM movie. This was not conducive to attention channeling on task performance. Conversely, M movie observation seemed to be associated to a cognitive load release, affording attention deployment for the resolution of the subsequent tasks.
Conclusions
It seems that some benefits associated to physical practice can result from the mere visualization of movies with human motor action content. These are the improvement in attention-related cognitive skills associated to psychophysiological changes that support a disengagement from mental effort. Crucially, the observation of exercise behavior seems to be a key factor for exercise adherence.

AB  - The flight deck of commercial aircraft is sophisticated and searching for the necessary information at the right time is sometimes challenging. This research investigates pilot's visual parameters while interacted with two different designs of crew alerting system by eye tracking technology. There are 24 aviation professionals that participated in this experiment including commercial pilots, private pilots and avionic engineers. Compared with traditional design, the new integrated design applied proximity compatibility principles to assist pilots in searching necessary information to deal with urgent situations. The results demonstrated that the integrated design is superior to traditional design in providing accurate instructions as determined by visual behaviors. However, the integrated design increases pilot's situation awareness by redirecting attention from current task to the most critical task with the cost of a longer total fixation duration time. Pilot's visual parameters demonstrated significant differences while interacting with PFD mainly numeric, ND mostly by symbols and EICAS with presented text messages. Therefore, flight deck design has to adopt a holistic approach as pilot's visual attentions is shifting among all types of different displays to gain situation awareness rather than focus on only one display. The design of integrated EICAS can provide detailed instructions to deal with urgent situations which induced higher cognitive loads as pilot's pupil dilation is significant bigger than interacted with traditional design. By eye tracking technology, it is applicable to design human-centred flight decks to improve safety and human performance in aviation.

AB  - Eco-driving assistance devices are being introduced to reduce CO2 emissions, but the overall changes in the user behavior have not been sufficiently explored. While in-vehicle driver advanced systems are designed to support a single driving task (e.g. reducing emissions), they also imply the adoption of a different driving behavior and different driving attitudes in order to be efficient. Adopting for the first time a new driving style could affect driver's acceptance and undermine new technologies' efficacy. Purpose of the present research is to measure and evaluate the user's responses to first-time use of eco-driving assisting technology. Driver's performances in a virtual simulator were compared between experimental and a control group. The actual driving parameters and CO2 emissions were recorded and compared to the optimal eco-driving style calculated by CarMaker software. The cognitive costs of the new driving style were measured by changes in the modulation of autonomic nervous system and NASA-TLX workload scale. Acceptance of the assisted driving style and general eco-friendly attitudes were analyzed by self-reported measures. Results show that being exposed for the first time to eco-driving technology produces a reduction of cumulate fuel consumption only due to speed reduction, and not to changes in the driving style parameters, as recommended by the assisting software. Overall CO2 emissions of eco-driving group were not different from the control group. Rather, the first time use of the eco-driving assistance increases perceived fatigue and the physiological cardiac autonomic balance related to increased workload over time. These difficulties show that eco-driving style cannot be simply adopted by following the assistance device indications. It seems rather a process, which requires specific support during in the first driving-interaction with eco-driving technology. The design of assistance device that aims to change the driving style, could benefit from the measurement of the user's workload to avoid primacy effect that potentially undermine technology efficacy in supporting user-sustainable behaviors.

AB  - Snake robots have shown a great potential for operations in confined workplaces that are less accessible or dangerous to human workers, such as the in-pipe inspection. However, the snake robot teleoperation remains a nontrivial task due to the unique locomotion mechanism (e.g., helical motion) and the constraints of the workplaces including the low visibility and indistinguishable features. Most snake robot feedback systems are based on the live camera view only. It is hard for the human operator to develop a correct spatial understanding of the remote workplace, leading to problems such as disorientation and motion sickness in snake robot teleoperation. This study designs and evaluates an innovative haptic assistant system for snake robot teleoperation in the in-pipe inspection. An upper-body haptic suit with 40 vibrators on both the front and back sides of the human operator was developed to generate haptic feedback corresponding to the bottom and up sides of the snake robot, transferring the egocentric sensation of the snake robot to the human operator. A human-subject experiment (n = 31) was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the developed system. The results indicate that the proposed haptic assistant system outperformed other feedback systems in terms of both task performance and subjective workload and motion sickness evaluations. It inspires new control and feedback designs for the future snake robot in industrial operations.

AB  - Official governmental monitoring of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon relies on human experts conducting visual analyzes of remote sensing images, an approach that is very expensive and time-consuming due to the enormous geographic extent to be inspected. The main obstacle to the adoption of fully automatic methods is the requirement for the highest possible deforestation detection accuracy, which arises from the official nature of the deforestation reports, used as a basis for deforestation prevention policies and international treaties. This work addresses such a high accuracy constraint by introducing a semi-automatic method that aims at limiting visual analysis to areas where automatic classification is characterized by high uncertainty. We hypothesize that classification uncertainty is correlated with classification error. Therefore, by trusting automatic detections with low uncertainty and subjecting areas of high uncertainty to visual audit, the amount of human intervention in the whole process could be limited to a small fraction of the forest area, while very high accuracies would be achieved. In this work we investigate various uncertainty estimation strategies, including multiple and single inference approaches, and evaluate different uncertainty metrics. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify the natural factors and deforestation practices that contribute to high uncertainty in automatic classification. We draw interesting conclusions from the analysis of selected regions of two distinct target sites, which exemplify common causes of uncertainty and indicate how uncertainty may be related with ongoing forest degradation processes. Through experimental evaluation at those sites, we demonstrate that the proposed semi-automatic methodology can achieve impressive accuracies in terms of F1-score values, exceeding 97%, while reducing the total human audit workload to just 3% of the target area.

AB  - Clinician task performance is significantly impacted by the navigational efficiency of the system interface. Here we propose and evaluate a navigational complexity framework useful for examining differences in electronic health record (EHR) interface systems and their impact on task performance. The methodological approach includes 1) expert-based methods—specifically, representational analysis (focused on interface elements), keystroke level modeling (KLM), and cognitive walkthrough; and 2) quantitative analysis of interactive behaviors based on video-captured observations. Medication administration record (MAR) tasks completed by nurses during preoperative (PreOp) patient assessment were studied across three Mayo Clinic regional campuses and three different EHR systems. By analyzing the steps executed within the interfaces involved to complete the MAR tasks, we characterized complexities in EHR navigation. These complexities were reflected in time spent on task, click counts, and screen transitions, and were found to potentially influence nurses’ performance. Two of the EHR systems, employing a single screen format, required less time to complete (mean 101.5, range 106–97 s), respectively, compared to one system employing multiple screens (176 s, 73% increase). These complexities surfaced through trade-offs in cognitive processes that could potentially influence nurses’ performance. Factors such as perceptual-motor activity, visual search, and memory load impacted navigational complexity. An implication of this work is that small tractable changes in interface design can substantially improve EHR navigation, overall usability, and workflow.

AB  - Manual assembly tasks are widespread in many production facilities. However, the manual tasks are often linked to workstations that are not ergonomically designed, which can lead to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs). These may result in low productivity, deterioration of worker performance, and issues affecting quality. The first aim of this research project is to analyze the various work postures associated with manual assembly work, within a plastics manufacturing company. The analysis of these work postures will help in understanding the ergonomic conditions of different workstations within the company. The second aim of this project is to study the OSHA incident reports and determine whether correlation exists between a specific workstation and specific body parts. The ultimate objective of this research is to find solutions and to recommend changes that improve the workstations. One way this can be accomplished is by taking ergonomic measures that can be used to evaluate working postures and physical workloads for manual assembly tasks to prevent ergonomic injuries which may lead to WRMDs. This is expected to result in improved productivity, better product quality, and lower medical costs.

AB  - Capacity dimensioning in production systems is an important task within strategic and tactical production planning which impacts system cost and performance. Traditionally capacity demand at each worksystem is determined from standard operating processes and estimated production flow rates, accounting for a desired level of utilization or required throughput times. However, for distributed production control systems, the flows across multiple possible production paths are not known a priori. In this contribution, we use methods from algorithmic game-theory and traffic-modeling to predict the flows, and hence capacity demand across worksystems, based on the available production paths and desired output rates, assuming non-cooperative agents with global information. We propose an iterative algorithm that converges simultaneously to a feasible capacity distribution and a flow distribution over multiple paths that satisfies Wardrop's first principle. We demonstrate our method on models of real-world production networks.

AB  - Instrumental actions are initially goal-directed but with repeated performance can become habitual. Habitual actions are adaptive, learned behaviours that are automated in order to reduce cognitive load and to allow for efficient interaction with the environment. Goal-directed and habitual actions are mediated by distinct neurocircuits which centre on the dorsal striatum and involve different cortical and limbic inputs. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) has yet to be considered in this neurocircuitry despite its anatomical connections with these neurocircuits and its established role in motivated behaviour. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the LH has a role in the development of habitual actions in rats by knocking down protein expression in the LH with short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). Two shRNAs were utilised, both of which were shown to reduce the expression of two neuropeptides within the LH, orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone, compared to a saline-vehicle control. This was unexpected given that one shRNA was a control vector (i.e, scrambled sequence), and the other shRNA was supposed to selectively target orexin’s precursor protein. Given this lack of specificity and that shRNA’s are known to be neurotoxic, the current study examined the impact of non-selective dysfunction of the LH on habitual actions. Adult male Long-Evans rats were trained to press a lever for a food outcome and were tested for goal directed and habitual behaviour following devaluation of the food. The shRNA groups displayed goal-directed actions following moderate instrumental training, but did not develop habitual actions following extended training. That is, control rats developed the expected habitual behaviour where lever-response rates were insensitive to outcome value when tested, whilst the shRNA groups reduced rates of responding on the lever under devalued conditioned and hence remained goal-directed. This failure to demonstrate habitual actions was unlikely to be secondary to changes in motivation or arousal as the shRNA groups did not show altered food consumption, body weight, lever response rates, or motor performance on a rota rod or tapered balance beam. However, locomotor activity was reduced in an open field test, consistent with the proposed role of the LH in spontaneous locomotor activity. Therefore, this study implicates the LH in habitual learning, and adds to the emerging evidence that the LH has a role in associative learning processes. This finding has implications for human conditions where there is dysfunction or neurodegeneration in the LH, as well as altered habitual actions, such as in Parkinson’s disease and drug addiction.

AB  - Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE), with the goal to support humans through system design, can contribute to responses to emergencies and crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we describe three cases presented at the 21st Triennial Congress of the International Ergonomics Association to demonstrate how HFE has been applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely to (1) develop a mobile diagnostic testing system, (2) understand the changes within physiotherapy services, and (3) guide the transition of a perioperative pain program to telemedicine. We reflect on methodological choices and lessons learned from each case and discuss opportunities to expand the impact of HFE in responses to future emergencies. The HFE discipline should develop faster, less resource intensive but still rigorous, methods, increase available HFE expertise by growing the field, and proactively enhance individual and public perception of the importance of HFE in crisis response.

AB  - Microservices and Serverless computing are promising cloud-based architectural models in the software development industry that have many advantages over previous technology models. The benefit of adopting these more novel models, however, is dependent on the volume of the application workload and the execution behavior. ScanMedicine is a new searching system dedicated to providing health care professionals, patients and researchers with easy access to intelligence underpinning health technology innovations. We present the design and implementation of ScanMedicine’s framework using AWS lambda functions and microservices. We incorporated a layered architectural style where each layer run on separate hardware and adopt different architectural technique.

AB  - In this study, we propose a mathematical model for optimizing the production of weapon parts with 3D printer through parallel machine scheduling. At the end of the battle with the enemy, many weapons are destroyed. Damaged weapons are classified as complete, medium, or minor destruction. Among them, a minor destruction-weapon can be reused immediately after repair by simply replacing a damaged or lost part. However, it is almost impossible to carry thousands of weapon parts due to the nature of troops that constantly move to different places in the battlefield. In order to improve this situation, it is possible to carry the 3D printer at a specific unit and produce necessary parts in the field to repair the minor destruction-weapon. For this purpose, this study proposes a scheduling model to produce the necessary parts in the shortest time after the end of each battle. The set of 3D printers is a parallel machine and can produce all sorts of parts, and it can have different ability to produce. 3D printers can produce finished product for each part at a time, or can produce two subparts separately for each part, but if they separately manufacture subparts, it increases the workload for that part because of additional production of attachment for assembly. That is, the total production time for that part in the case of manufacturing subparts separately is longer than that in the case of producing the finished product at once. Nevertheless, this study confirms that it is possible to shorten the makespan when planning the production schedule of 3D printer by introducing the subpart-split manufacturing concept for weapon parts.

AB  - Air traffic controller workload is a bottleneck on air traffic growth, warranting automation solutions. This paper discusses the effect of transparency on the acceptance of resolution advisories generated by an adaptive automation tool. Two transparency types were tested in a between-subjects experiment (n = 16). The first group worked with a display which explicitly presented the variables which the automation uses in its reasoning, while the second group worked with a display which allowed subjects to infer these variables, i.e., they were implicitly presented. Both incorporated a preview functionality, which allowed for a comparison of the automation resolution advisory and the controller solution. Results show no significant differences in acceptance of advisories, workload or frustration ratings between the transparency levels. Overall, the acceptance of automation advisories reduced (not significant). The group using the explicit transparency received more short-term collision alerts, and their automation was longer active. Neither group used the available preview functionality to its full extent.

AB  - An innovative airport control tower concept based on the use of modern augmented reality technologies has been developed and validated by means of human-in-the-loop experiments in a simulated environment. An optical-based augmented reality interface underpins the proposed concept that consists in providing air traffic control operators in the airport control tower with complete head-up information, as opposed to the current mix of information retrieval through both head-up real view and head-down interfaces. Specific measurement of the time spent by the operator working in either head-up or head-down position, show that the proposal has a clear effect in stimulating the air traffic control operator to work in a head-up position more than in a head-down position, with positive effects on his/her situational awareness and perceived workload, especially when dealing with low visibility conditions operational scenarios.

AB  - Introduction
Slips, trips and falls due to an induced loss balance have been identified as the leading cause of occupational injuries. This study aimed to analyze the impact of two military boots, standard boot (STD) and minimalist boot (MIN) on slip events, before (PRE) and after (POST) a military type load carrying task.
Methods
Sixteen male participants (age: 27 ± 3.9 years; height: 178 ± 6.2 cm, mass: 87 ± 12.4 kg) were tested for heel kinematics using motion capture, during unexpected (US) and expected slips (ES) both before and after the task. Slip parameters of heel slip distance (HSD) and mean heel slip velocity (MHSV) were analyzed with a 2 (STD × MIN) × 2 (PRE × POST) × 2 (US × ES) repeated measures ANOVA.
Results
Significantly greater HSD (p = 0.002) and MHSV (p = 0.001) were demonstrated in STD compared to MIN, regardless of the load carrying workload and the type of slip. No significant interactions between boots, workload and slip type were found. MIN exhibited a greater percent of non-hazardous slips compared to STD.
Conclusions
Greater HSD and MHSV seen in STD, suggests that MIN performed better under slippery conditions. The military type workload and the type of slip did not appear to influence slip parameters, with boot differences seen as the major influence on these slip outcomes. MIN boot's better performance could be attributed to the minimalist sole, tread and groove pattern, lighter mass and flexible shaft aiding in better maneuvering under slippery conditions.
Relevance to industry
Slip outcomes in two different military boots, before and after a military type load carrying workload are addressed. The lighter minimalist tactical boot outperformed the standard tactical boot, under slippery conditions. Findings from this study will help offer suggestions for footwear design in the military, especially for maneuvering slippery environment.

AB  - Over the past decade, Apache Hadoop has become a leading framework for big data processing. Single board computer (SBC) clusters, predominantly adopting Raspberry Pi (RPi), have been employed to explore the potential of MapReduce processing in terms of low power and cost because, capital costs aside, power consumption has also become a primary concern in many industries. After building SBC clusters, it is prevalent to consider adding more nodes, particularly newer generation SBCs, to the existing clusters or replacing old (or inactive) nodes with new ones to improve performance, inevitably causing heterogeneous SBC clusters. The Hadoop framework on these heterogeneous SBC clusters creates challenging new problems due to computing resource discrepancies in each node. Native Hadoop does not carefully consider the heterogeneity of the cluster nodes. Consequently, heterogeneous SBC Hadoop clusters result in significant performance variation or, more critically, persistent node failures. This paper proposes a new Hadoop Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) architecture design to improve MapReduce performance on heterogeneous SBC Hadoop clusters with tight computing resources. We newly implement two main scheduling policies on Hadoop YARN based on the correct computing resource information that each SBC node provides: (1) two (master-driven vs. slave-driven) MapReduce task scheduling frameworks to determine more effective processing modes and (2) ApplicationMaster (AM) and reduce task distribution mechanisms to provide the best Hadoop performance by minimizing performance variation. Thus, the proposed Hadoop framework makes the best use of the performance-frugal SBC Hadoop cluster by intelligently distributing MapReduce tasks to each node. To our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first redesigned Hadoop YARN architecture to address various challenging problems particularly on heterogeneous SBC Hadoop clusters for big data processing. The extensive experiments with Hadoop benchmarks demonstrate that the redesigned framework performs better performance than the native Hadoop by an average of 2.55× and 1.55× under I/O intensive and CPU-intensive workloads, respectively.

AB  - The paper compares and evaluates three different HMIs (Human Machine Interface) for an ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) supporting cooperative interactions between drivers while merging and turning left. In road traffic, cooperation means that drivers (cooperation partners) coordinate their driving behaviour in a way that they facilitate each other’s intended driving manoeuvres. An experimental study was conducted with 30 participants in a static high-end simulator. The test scenarios included merging onto a motorway and turning left at a rural intersection. As independent variables, the HMI (Baseline vs. Sensor vs. C2X (Car-to-everything)) was varied in addition to the cooperation situation (merging vs. turning left). All HMI variants were based on a HUD (Head-Up Display). In the Baseline condition, the HMI only showed information about speed and navigation. The Sensor HMI visualised additionally the driving situation as it can be detected by the vehicle's own sensors. The C2X HMI was based on C2X communication and also represented the different phases of manoeuvre coordination with the cooperation partner. The traffic flow and the behaviour of the surrounding traffic did not differ between the different HMI variants, in order to ensure that the traffic situation did not influence the participants’ evaluation of the HMI variants. The dependent variables included subjective (e.g. acceptance, usability) and objective measures (e.g. driving and gaze behaviour). The results showed that a system supporting cooperative interactions is generally accepted by drivers. The most preferred system was the C2X HMI. The advantages of a C2X based HMI were an improved user experience leading to a greater intent to use the ADAS for cooperative driving interactions, increased system trust, and an easier handling of the system. The workload of the C2X HMI did not exceed the level reported for the Baseline or the Sensor HMI – although the C2X HMI presented more information. The results are used to derive indications for the design of assistance systems supporting cooperative driving behaviour.

AB  - Cloud infrastructures are becoming a common platform for storage and workload operations for industries. With increasing rate of data generation, the cloud storage industry has already grown into a multi-billion dollar industry. This industry offers services with very strict service level agreements (SLAs) to insure a high Quality of Service (QoS) for its clients. A breach of these SLAs results in a heavy economic loss for the service provider. We study a queueing model of data backup systems with a focus on the age of data. The age of data is roughly defined as the time for which data has not been backed up and is therefore a measure of uncertainty for the user. We precisely define the performance measure and compute the generating function of its distribution. It is critical to ensure that the tail probabilities are small so that the system stays within SLAs with a high probability. Therefore, we also analyze the tail distribution of the age of data by performing dominant singularity analysis of its generating function. Our formulas can help the service providers to set the system parameters adequately.

AB  - We review information-theoretic measures of cognitive load during sentence processing that have been used to quantify word prediction effort. Two such measures, surprisal and next-word entropy, suffer from shortcomings when employed for a predictive processing view. We propose a novel metric, lookahead information gain, that can overcome these short-comings. We estimate the different measures using probabilistic language models. Subsequently, we put them to the test by analysing how well the estimated measures predict human processing effort in three data sets of naturalistic sentence reading. Our results replicate the well known effect of surprisal on word reading effort, but do not indicate a role of next-word entropy or lookahead information gain. Our computational results suggest that, in a predictive processing system, the costs of predicting may outweigh the gains. This idea poses a potential limit to the value of a predictive mechanism for the processing of language. The result illustrates the unresolved problem of finding estimations of word-by-word prediction that, first, are truly independent of perceptual processing of the to-be-predicted words, second, are statistically reliable predictors of experimental data, and third, can be derived from more general assumptions about the cognitive processes involved.

AB  - The traditional building code compliance checking process mainly relies on design reviewers to review design documents or models manually. The intensive manual effort needed makes this process time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated compliance checking (ACC) could be a promising upgrade of the traditional manual code compliance checking. With a reduced workload on design reviewers, ACC is cheaper, faster, and immune to human errors. To support ACC, building code requirements need to be represented in a computer-processable format to enable automated reasoning, which will in turn allow an automated assessment of the building design's compliance status with building codes. A major limitation of many existing ACC systems/methods is their limited range of checkable building code requirements. To address that, the state of the art uses pattern matching-based rules to transform building code requirements into computable formats automatically, but the ruleset was developed and tested only on a few chapters of building code requirements. An efficient ruleset expansion method is needed to increase its range of checkable building code requirements at a low cost, to bring ACC systems closer to full deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a new regulatory information transformation ruleset expansion method for expanding an existing ruleset. This method can expand the range of checkable code requirements of ACC systems without significant manual effort. The proposed ruleset expansion method takes an iterative approach to ensure the generality and validity of new pattern matching-based rules and the quality of information transformation results. The expanded ruleset was tested on generating logic clauses from Chapter 5 of the International Building Code 2015. Compared to the baseline ruleset, the expanded ruleset increased the predicate-level precision, recall, and F1-score of the logic clause generation by 10.44%, 25.72%, and 18.02%, to 95.17%, 96.60%, and 95.88%, respectively.

AB  - Power management is one of the significant challenges to be addressed in multi-/many-core microprocessors. Furthermore, the multi-core microprocessors experience unforeseen scenarios such as performance degradation over time, manufacturing defects, power, and thermal impacts with time. Traditional power management techniques, though efficient, is not designed to handle such unseen scenarios. Furthermore, the variation in performance requirements is one of the challenges faced in the era of machine learning. We propose a self-aware power management scheme for multi-core microprocessors in this work to address the above-mentioned issues. We perform application-level power management in this work to overcome the overheads imposed by core-level power management and system-level power management inefficiency. The power management unit employs a linear predictor for workload prediction to perform DVFS. On top of the power manager, the self-aware controller is hierarchically placed to monitor the system components’ health and adapt the power manager's decision to meet the performance requirements and handle changes in system components’ health. We evaluate the proposed self-aware power manager under externally provided high performance goals, and resource contention. A power saving of up to 16% compared to existing power management techniques, and 2.4× speedup with 25% additional power to satisfy high performance compared to power management without self-awareness for a microprocessor with up to 32-cores is achieved.

AB  - The maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) processes of aircraft engines are dominated by a high proportion of manual work and subjective condition assessment of used parts. This leads to inefficiency due to additional, partially not required workload and high scrap rates. Further, there is a lack of knowledge about the effects of the respective repair measures on the performance of the parts. So far, there are no autonomous repair solutions that allow an optimal and individually tailored regeneration. In order to realize such a process, it is necessary to bring together the manufacturing, function-simulating and logistics-oriented disciplines in an integrated system. For this, data management along the process chain is an important success factor. In particular, the provision and linking of the data and data formats required for simulation and the production environment is of fundamental importance. This paper presents a data architecture that can serve as a framework for data integration within a representative process chain for regeneration.

AB  - Property graphs are a common form of linked data, with path queries used to traverse and explore them for enterprise transactions and mining. Temporal property graphs are a recent variant where time is a first-class entity to be queried over, and their properties and structure vary over time. These are seen in social, telecom, transit and epidemic networks. However, current graph databases and query engines have limited support for temporal relations among graph entities, no support for time-varying entities and/or do not scale on distributed resources. We address this gap by extending a linear path query model over property graphs to include intuitive temporal predicates and aggregation operators over temporal graphs. We design a distributed execution model for these temporal path queries using the interval-centric computing model, and develop a novel cost model to select an efficient execution plan from several. We perform detailed experiments of our Granite distributed query engine using both static and dynamic temporal property graphs as large as 52M vertices, 218M edges and 325M properties, and a 1600-query workload, derived from the LDBC benchmark. We frequently offer sub-second query latencies on a commodity cluster, which is 149×–1140× faster compared to industry-leading Neo4J shared-memory graph database and the JanusGraph/Spark distributed graph query engine. Granite also completes 100% of the queries for all graphs, compared to only 32–92% workload completion by the baseline systems. Further, our cost model selects a query plan that is within 10% of the optimal execution time in 90% of the cases. Despite the irregular nature of graph processing, we exhibit a weak-scaling efficiency of ≥60% on 8 nodes and ≥40% on 16 nodes, for most query workloads.

AB  - A dual task was designed to involve a tracking mission with various tracking speeds and a spatial compatibility task with various signal-key mappings and presentation modalities. This dual task was used to investigate the effects of workload and resource competition in distinct parts of the dual-task process. The results demonstrated that increasing the tracking speed adversely affected the tracking performance but led to positive arousal to the secondary discrete response task. Visual spatial signals gave the shortest reaction time due to the optimal time-sharing of the visual resources in the focal and ambient channels. Compared with visual spatial signals, spatial signals of auditory and tactile modalities did not lead to an improved performance because of their cross-modality nature. These findings provided practical design guidelines for dual tasks in which the operators need to complete a continuous monitoring task visually and elicit timely and accurate responses to spatial information.

However, this approach tends to disregard the differences between skill level, experience, capabilities, learning rates and fatigue rates of different individual workers forming the team. In particular, due to differences in visual, auditory, cognitive and psychomotor capabilities of different workers and brain resource demands of different activities, the traditional approach may result in inconsistent workloads and uneven fatigue rates within a crew, affecting the workers' and crew's safety negatively. This paper proposes a novel framework for task assignment to construction workers in which safety of individual workers and thus the crew is ensured through optimizing workload distributions within a crew. The framework computes visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor requirements of the jobs assigned to a worker and minimizes the identified workload imbalances through collaborative execution of shared tasks. The application of the proposed framework is examined on a pipe spool fabrication operation of a refinery project in a simulation environment.

AB  - Using a color code on human-machine interfaces could sensibly reduce the informational density. In this paper, we focused on the supervision interfaces used in engine room of Merchant Navy vessels. There is no regulation about color use on these interfaces, despite the color code playing an important role in showing information. The ISO Standard 14726-2008 regulates the color code printed on physical pipes and is used to represent the fluids flowing through it. The purpose of this study is to determine if we could use this standardized color code on the interfaces and create a connection between the physical pipes and their graphical representation. Two experimentations are presented, in which we compared the effects of two color codes on the performance at searching tasks carried out by novices and experts. One code is extracted from ISO Standard 14726-2008 (Normative Pipe Identification Color Code), and the other is created by taking into account general guidelines and common uses (Ergonomic Recommendations Color Code). The results showed that the NPICC, and its bicolor version in particular, increased the mental workload and the searching time required by novices. Experts had more difficulties to recognize the fluids represented by two colors and they used the two-colored fluid system less frequently than novices to retrieve an information.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a Machine to Machine (M2M) Low Cost and Secure (LCS) communication system for e-Healthcare society. The system is designed to take into consideration the psychological issues related to all actors in the e-Healthcare society such as: stress due to high workload, anxiety, and loneliness. The system is capable of performing most of the tasks in an autonomous and intelligent manner, which minimizes the workload of medical staffs, and consequently minimizes the associated psychological stress and improves the quality of patient care as well as the system performance. We show how the different actors in the e-Healthcare society can interact with each other in a secure manner. To ensure data privacy, the mechanism involves intelligent authentication based on random distributive key management, electronic certificate distribution, and modified realm Kerberos. The system handles dynamic assignments of doctors to specific patients. It also addresses the need for patients to share their health information with strangers while dealing with the privacy preservation issue. Finally, the simulation type implementation is performed on Visual Basic .net 2013 that shows the success of the proposed Low Cost and Secure (LCS) algorithm.

AB  - Order picking has long been identified as a time- and cost-intensive task in almost every supply chain. One interesting approach to accelerate the picking process is to separate the warehouse into forward and reserve areas, where the forward area holds a limited amount of inventory for fast picking that is replenished by the stock in the reserve area. To date, the replenishment operation is often conducted manually or using goods-to-person technologies such as automated storage/retrieval systems. Recently, a newly developed market-ready technology called picking robots, which are a kind of autonomous mobile robots, was implemented in e-commerce warehouses. They can be integrated into existing manual order picking systems without modifying the warehouse layout. In this study, we simulate a case wherein picking robots are applied for replenishment tasks to avoid stock shortages in fast-picking areas, thereby supporting the picking activities of humans. The aim is to reduce the human workload during the order picking process. We investigate various scenarios with different human–robot team configurations and demand patterns. The results indicate that such a setting can improve working conditions by simultaneously reducing human energy expenditure and costs per pick. The contribution of this study is to introduce these robots to forward–reserve warehouses, obtain preliminary results regarding system performance, and discuss related opportunities for future work.

AB  - In production, poor ergonomic environments not only lead to increased workloads and health hazards for employees but also tend to reduce efficiency and quality. Recently, the human-cyber-physical (HCP) system has been proposed and widely studies to meet human capabilities and limitations. However, most existing frameworks are still not adaptive enough to integrate humans into a smart production environment due to a lack of real-time individual human factors digitalization. This research proposes an HCP workstation model for comprehensive assembly resources digitalization and autonomous interaction by CPS enabling technologies. Based on this, an adaptive control system has been developed for proactive ergonomic risk mitigation. Computer vision is deployed for real-time individual ergonomic evaluation and a prototype has been set up for functional validation.

AB  - The increasing need for improving the utilisation of existing nursing staff and better workload distribution has made nursing staff demand modelling and nurse scheduling critical. However, both rely on human experience, often leading to ineffective planning. This study describes the use of cloud computing together with mobile devices for planning the optimal size and mix of nursing teams and scheduling in nursing homes. In the context of residential care, cloud computing can make the determination and planning of nursing staff demand more efficient and cost effective, while mobile devices can facilitate easy and rapid dissemination of planning information. This study applies nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II in cloud computing to solve the integrated nursing staff demand modelling and scheduling problem. A case study of a subvented nursing home in Hong Kong was conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and framework. Results show that the total overtime work (in hours) was minimised, while the nurse-to-resident ratios were significantly improved. The model permits an analysis of the impact of digital technologies on healthcare at the strategic level. Further, results suggest that it is cost beneficial to introduce digitalisation to integrated nursing staff demand modelling and scheduling problems in nursing homes.

AB  - Data centres constitute the engine of the Internet, and run a major portion of large web and mobile applications, content delivery and sharing platforms, and Cloud-computing business models. The high performance of such infrastructures is therefore critical for their correct functioning. This work focuses on the improvement of data-centre performance by dynamically switching the main data-centre governance software system: the resource manager. Instead of focusing on the development of new resource-managing models as soon as new workloads and patterns appear, we propose DISCERNER, a decision-theory model that can learn from numerous data-centre execution logs to determine which existing resource-managing model may optimise the overall performance for a given time period. Such a decision-theory system employs a classic machine-learning classifier to make real-time decisions based on past execution logs and on the current data-centre operational situation. A set of extensive and industry-guided experiments has been simulated by a validated data-centre simulation tool. The results obtained show that the values of key performance indicators may be improved by at least 20% in realistic scenarios.

AB  - The line bisection task is commonly depicted as a valid diagnostic tool to help differentiate between primary visual field defects and spatial neglect. However, recent studies have addressed possible drawbacks in the acute phase after stroke onset. We investigated these critical assumptions in a large and homogeneous sample of 180 acute stroke patients. Line bisection, cancellation performance, copying, and primary visual field defects were assessed in 180 acute right-hemispheric stroke patients. Effects of visual field defects and concurrent spatial neglect on line bisection were analyzed by multiple regression to account for possible additive and interactive effects. The relation between line bisection and other tests applied in spatial neglect was explored by factorial analysis. We found no evidence for the existence of a contralesional ‘hemianopic line bisection error’ in acute patients with primary visual field defects. Such patients even showed a more pronounced ipsilesional line bisection error. Second, the factorial analysis revealed that the line bisection task on the one hand and cancellation/copying tasks on the other were represented by different factors, indicating that they make different cognitive demands. In the acute phase of stroke, line bisection does not appear to be a valid task to diagnose neither primary visual field defects nor spatial neglect (the latter as defined by its core symptoms (cf., Karnath and Rorden, 2012) which are typically captured with cancellation/copying tasks).

AB  - Although both resting and task-induced functional connectivity (FC) have been used to characterize the human brain and cognitive abilities, the potential of task-induced FCs in individualized prediction for out-of-scanner cognitive traits remains largely unexplored. A recent study Greene et al. (2018) predicted the fluid intelligence scores using FCs derived from rest and multiple task conditions, suggesting that task-induced brain state manipulation improved prediction of individual traits. Here, using a large dataset incorporating fMRI data from rest and 7 distinct task conditions, we replicated the original study by employing a different machine learning approach, and applying the method to predict two reading comprehension-related cognitive measures. Consistent with their findings, we found that task-based machine learning models often outperformed rest-based models. We also observed that combining multi-task fMRI improved prediction performance, yet, integrating the more fMRI conditions can not necessarily ensure better predictions. Compared with rest, the predictive FCs derived from language and working memory tasks were highlighted with more predictive power in predominantly default mode and frontoparietal networks. Moreover, prediction models demonstrated high stability to be generalizable across distinct cognitive states. Together, this replication study highlights the benefit of using task-based FCs to reveal brain-behavior relationships, which may confer more predictive power and promote the detection of individual differences of connectivity patterns underlying relevant cognitive traits, providing strong evidence for the validity and robustness of the original findings.

AB  - Timber components in historic buildings are susceptible to deterioration due to the complex external environment. The loss of material in these components and changes in their cross-section geometry significantly impact the stability and load-bearing capacity of historic buildings. A portable LiDAR device is utilized to acquire the cross-section geometry of the deteriorated components. The irregular cross-section profiles are extracted using point cloud slicing and the Alpha-Shape algorithm. Geometric characteristics such as cross-section area, moment of inertia, and moment of resistance are calculated using Green's integral method. The performance of this method is evaluated by measuring eight groups of deteriorated components with different cross-section characteristics and comparing it with five traditional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the calculation accuracy by 1%–21% relative to traditional methods, thereby enhancing reliability by 9%–54%. Additionally, it reduces manual calculation workload and human error, while promoting calculation efficiency. The method exhibits excellent applicability and high efficiency, with an error below 3% when compared to the true value. This method proves valuable in evaluating the extent of deterioration in historic timber components and provides essential data for preventive conservation and restoration of historic timber buildings.

AB  - Background
Methods to monitor cardiac functioning non-invasively can accelerate preclinical and clinical research into novel treatment options for heart failure. However, manual image analysis of cardiac substructures is resource-intensive and error-prone. While automated methods exist for clinical CT images, translating these to preclinical μCT data is challenging. We employed deep learning to automate the extraction of quantitative data from both CT and μCT images.
Methods
We collected a public dataset of cardiac CT images of human patients, as well as acquired μCT images of wild-type and accelerated aging mice. The left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle were manually segmented in the μCT training set. After template-based heart detection, two separate segmentation neural networks were trained using the nnU-Net framework.
Results
The mean Dice score of the CT segmentation results (0.925 ± 0.019, n = 40) was superior to those achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms. Automated and manual segmentations of the μCT training set were nearly identical. The estimated median Dice score (0.940) of the test set results was comparable to existing methods. The automated volume metrics were similar to manual expert observations. In aging mice, ejection fractions had significantly decreased, and myocardial volume increased by age 24 weeks.
Conclusions
With further optimization, automated data extraction expands the application of (μ)CT imaging, while reducing subjectivity and workload. The proposed method efficiently measures the left and right ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial mass. With uniform translation between image types, cardiac functioning in diastolic and systolic phases can be monitored in both animals and humans.

AB  - Rubber-tyred gantry cranes are one of the major sources of carbon dioxide emissions in container terminals. In a move to green transportation, the traditional diesel powered cranes are being converted to electric ones. In this paper, we study the deployment of electric powered gantry cranes (ERTGs) in container terminal yards. Cranes always move in-between blocks to serve different workload. ERTGs use electricity for most movements but switch to diesel engines to allow inter-block transfers between unaligned blocks. We exploit this feature and propose to consider simultaneously the CO2 emissions and workload delays to develop carbon-efficient deployment strategies. Moreover, unlike previous works we consider the workload uncertainty, and model the problem as a two-stage stochastic program. A sample average approximation framework with Benders decomposition is employed to solve the problem. Multiple acceleration techniques are proposed, including a tailored regularised decomposition approach and valid inequalities. A case study with sample data from a major port in East China show that our proposal could reduce significantly CO2 emissions with only a marginal compromise in workload delays. Our numerical experiments also highlight the significance of the stochastic model and the efficiency of the Benders algorithms.

AB  - Data streaming belongs to the Big Data ecosystem, which generates high-frequency data streams featuring time-varying characteristics that challenge the traditional stream processing systems capacities. To deal with this problem, many self-adaptive stream processing systems have been proposed. Despite the evolution of self-adaptive systems, there is still a lack of standardized benchmarking systems to enable scientists to evaluate the autonomic capacities of their solutions. In this work, we propose an index called AI-SPS inspired by the human cerebral auto-regulation process. The index quantifies the capacity of an adaptive stream processing systems to self-adapt in the presence of highly dynamic workloads. An index of this nature will help the scientific community generate fair comparisons among literature with the aim of creating better solutions. We validate our proposal by evaluating the adaptive behavior of two state of the art self-adaptive stream processing systems. Tests were performed using real traffic datasets adapted specifically to stress the processing system. Results show that the proposed index quantifies the adaptation capacity of self-adaptive stream processing systems effectively.

AB  - This qualitative study aims to investigate the attitudes of undergraduate students towards their experience with emergency online learning during the first few weeks of the mandatory shift to online learning caused by COVID-19. Students from two general English courses at a university located in Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates were asked to write semi-guided essays during the week preceding the final exams of the second semester of the academic year 2019–20. A sample of these essays was analyzed using open coding. Findings revealed that cost- and time-effectiveness, safety, convenience and improved participation were the most frequently cited positive aspects of the emergency online learning experience, while distraction and reduced focus, heavy workload, problems with technology and the internet, and insufficient support from instructors and colleagues were the most recurrent negative aspects. The findings of the study help instructors and institutions understand students’ attitudes regarding online learning under abnormal circumstances. A number of recommendations informed by the interpretation of the participants’ feedback are offered to assist instructors, administrators and policy makers improve future online learning experiences.

In this two step process, the first one, the categorization of documents, is time consuming and relies on the knowledge of a human categorizer agent. It does not add direct valued information to the process that will be provided in the second step, when the document is revised by the correct expert. This paper proposes Machine Learning tools and techniques to learn from the manually pre-categorized data to automatically classify new content. For this work a real industrial context was considered. Text from original documents, text from added value information and Semantic Annotations of those texts were used to generate different models, considering manually pre-established categories. Moreover, three algorithms from different approaches were used to generate the models. Finally, the results obtained were compared to select the best model in terms of accuracy and also on the reduction of the amount of document readings (human workload).

AB  - Human factors tests are important components of systems design. Designers need to evaluate users’ performance and workload while using a system and compare different design options to determine the optimal design choice. Currently, human factors evaluation and tests mainly rely on empirical user studies, which add a heavy cost to the design process. In addition, it is difficult to conduct comprehensive user tests at early design stages when no physical interfaces have been implemented. To address these issues, I develop computational human performance modeling techniques that can simulate users’ interaction with machine systems. This method uses a general cognitive architecture to computationally represent human cognitive capabilities and constraints. Task-specific models can be built with the specifications of user knowledge, user strategies, and user group differences. The simulation results include performance measures such as task completion time and error rate as well as workload measures. Completed studies have modeled multitasking scenarios in a wide range of domains, including transportation, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. The success of these studies demonstrated the modeling capabilities of this method. Cognitive-architecture-based models are useful, but building a cognitive model itself can be difficult to learn and master. It usually requires at least medium-level programming skills to understand and use the language and syntaxes that specify the task. For example, to build a model that simulates a driving task, a modeler needs to build a driving simulation environment so that the model can interact with the simulated vehicle. In order to simply this process, I have conducted preliminary programming work that directly connects the mental model to existing task environment simulation programs. The model will be able to directly obtain perceptual information from the task program and send control commands to the task program. With cognitive model-based tools, designers will be able to see the model performing the tasks in real-time and obtain a report of the evaluation. Automated human factors evaluation methods have tremendous value to support systems design and evaluation.

AB  - The problems of a material selection for making the boiler pipes in a responsible steam plant and the technology for their welding are considered in this paper. The boiler is screened, complex, radiating energetic plant, with the natural water circulation in the hanging steel structure. Based on the legal regulations, the mandatory periodic reparation of the most important components is performed. This is why the check of mechanical properties, for the used and new materials for eventual replacement and building-in was done, as well as the check of the prescribed reparation procedures. The components that were in exploitation were checked, since their properties change with time. Checking consisted of testing the tensile material properties at room and elevated temperatures, measurements of hardness and analysis of materials’ microstructures. Besides the experimental tests, the numerical modeling and analysis of the workload of the fluid transporting pipes was conducted. In that way it was established which material is optimal for manufacturing the boiler pipes.

AB  - Social psychological research is increasingly interested in the cognitive and affective processes underlying human behavior in social environments. To match this emerging interest, social psychology is embracing new methodological approaches. We identify eye-tracking as an unobtrusive, direct and fine-grained process tracing technique with promising implications for these new developments. In particular, eye-tracking helps researchers avoid relying on self-report measures alone and otherwise necessary interruptions of the processes they aim to observe and understand. In order to enable social psychologists to effectively use eye-tracking, we provide a systematic review of commonly used measures. Following an introduction of the basic principles and assumptions underlying the use of eye-tracking generally, we review eye-tracking measures addressing concepts of interest for many core theories of social psychology. Specifically, we introduce options to measure processing depth and decision effort, information weighting, search strategies, cognitive load and arousal. We showcase potential uses in exemplary research questions, providing a starting point for how to select appropriate measures and tailor designs to future applications of eye-tracking to social psychology. Further, we critically discuss the limitations and auxiliary assumptions on which the introduced measures are based. Finally, we illustrate the use of eye-tracking with examples from contemporary psychological research with relevance for social psychology, and conclude with an outlook for potential benefits of the use of eye-tracking methods in core topics of social psychology.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the order acceptance and order release decisions of a manufacturer facing order-specific demand. In contrast to previous literature, both demand and production are stochastic. We develop a novel bid-price-based revenue management approach to solve this decision problem. The production system is modeled using clearing functions to capture the non-linear inter-dependency of workload and lead times in stochastic production systems. In extant literature, a common approach to cope with variability in a production system is to introduce fixed, workload-independent lead times. We show in a numerical study that our newly developed approach based on clearing functions clearly outperforms this fixed lead time approach.

AB  - Teleoperation of unmanned vehicles in high stress environments has been a subject of research in many domains, which focus primarily on system and operator performance. Unmanned ground vehicles for rescue, also known as search and rescue robots, serve as extensions of responders in a disaster, providing real-time video and other relevant information about the situation. However, physically separating responder and robot introduces latency between the human input provided to the unmanned vehicle to execute an operation and the subsequent response provided by the system. This latency (lag or time delay) is determined by the distance and the bandwidth of the connection between the operator and the unmanned vehicle. Automating these systems may mitigate the effect of latency to an extent; however, this has its own consequences, such as leaving the responder out of the loop, which subsequently leads to detrimental effects on situational awareness. This research investigates the relationship between latency and the performance of the human operator of a teleoperated robot at different levels of system complexity and the effect of different levels of automation on this relationship. Eighty participants operated one or two unmanned teleoperated robots to complete two search and rescue tasks. The study utilized a 2 × 2 × 2 mixed-subjects experimental design with the automation level and latency level being the between-subjects factors and the system complexity (controlling one or two robots) being the within-subjects factor. The dependent variables were operator performance, perceived workload, and the subjective rating of trust with automation. A latency of 500 ms showed a significant decrease in performance in time to complete the task and a significant increase in the perceived physical workload. Both the automation level and latency level moderated the system complexity effect on the subjective rating of trust in the robotic system. The level of trust decreased over time in the one-robot condition as opposed to no change in the two-robot condition. The error rate decreased over time at different rates based on the number of robots or the latency level. Based on the results of the study, several design implications are suggested for improving performance including adding features to the automation that will allow the operator to use common strategies and providing necessary information using multiple sensory channels. Future research directions are also proposed.

AB  - Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained with pixel-level segmentation masks achieve high performance in the task of instance segmentation. The difficulty of acquiring such annotation limits the application and popularization of the DCNN-based approaches. To address the issue, a weakly supervised approach is proposed in the paper which performs instance segmentation only with the supervision of bounding box or coarse localization annotation. A novel DCNN model is constructed which consists of two branches: the centerness branch and the segmentation branch. The former branch is to learn the semantically spatial importance over the areas of object instances under the localization supervision. Object proposals with exact boundaries are automatically generated and are then ranked under the guidance of the output of the centerness branch. The most matched instance proposal is assigned to each object, which is then used to supervise the segmentation branch. The losses are calculated by both the outputs of the two branches and the entire DCNN model is trained end-to-end. Experiments are extensively conducted to verify the effectiveness. With the supervision of precise bounding box annotation, our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in the comparison with recent related works. And in the case of coarse localization annotation, our approach only deduces a slight reduction in accuracy, which significantly outperforms other approaches. The excellent performance demonstrates that our approach would be helpful to further alleviate the workload of image annotation while maintaining competitive accuracy.

AB  - As the deployment of unmanned systems becomes increasingly mainstream, it is crucial to understand the effects of the workload (WL) associated with operating and interacting with these systems. There are multiple categories and types of WL measures, but not all meet the criteria for useful measures. It is not uncommon to find that multiple WL measures for the same task do not concur, which raises questions about whether there should be specific WL measures for certain tasks, and if so, how that should be determined. The present experiment investigated the sensitivity of various physiological and self-report measures in detecting changes in WL elicited by different levels of task demands in two tasks. Each participant was asked to assume the role of a Soldier in a human-robot team performing a simulated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The mission entailed performing a change detection task and a peripheral task of maintaining awareness of the robot teammate's location and surroundings. Auditory prompts were presented to probe the participant's situation awareness of the robot, with regard to its direction of travel and features of its surroundings. Physiological devices used to assess WL were the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), transcranial Doppler (TCD), functional Near-Infrared (fNIR), and eye tracker. Self-report measures included the TLX and DSSQ. Findings from the present experiment inform developers of unmanned systems about the sensitivity of various WL measures in assessing levels of mental demands imposed by working with unmanned systems.

AB  - Abstract:
Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) have successfully reduced drivers’ workload and increased safety. However, the excessive use of such assistance systems might reduce the chances of developing drivers’ skill. Haptic-shared and cooperative controls are methods in which the automated system shares a single operation with human operators and provides partial assistance, respectively. Effective collaboration between a human operator and an automated system can be achieved by the tuning controller, which is introduced to facilitate the improvement of human operators’ skills. We discuss a methodology to decrease drivers’ workload and improve their driving skills by using haptic shared and cooperative control methods. Backward parking assist by haptic shared control is presented to increase performance during assistance and skill improvement after assistance.

AB  - The extent to which brain responses differ across varying cognitive demands is referred to as “neural differentiation,” and greater neural differentiation has been associated with better cognitive performance in older adults. An emerging approach has examined within-person neural differentiation using moment-to-moment brain signal variability. A number of studies have found that brain signal variability differs by cognitive state; however, the factors that cause signal variability to rise or fall on a given task remain understudied. We hypothesized that top performers would modulate signal variability according to the complexity of sensory input, upregulating variability when processing more feature-rich stimuli. In the current study, 46 older adults passively viewed face and house stimuli during fMRI. Low-level analyses showed that house images were more feature-rich than faces, and subsequent computational modelling of ventral visual stream responses (HMAX) revealed that houses were more feature-rich especially in V1/V2-like model layers. Notably, we then found that participants exhibiting greater face-to-house upregulation of brain signal variability in V1/V2 (higher for house relative to face stimuli) also exhibited more accurate, faster, and more consistent behavioral performance on a battery of offline visuo-cognitive tasks. Further, control models revealed that face-house modulation of mean brain signal was relatively insensitive to offline cognition, providing further evidence for the importance of brain signal variability for understanding human behavior. We conclude that the ability to align brain signal variability to the richness of perceptual input may mark heightened trait-level behavioral performance in older adults.

AB  - Steady state gait dynamics has been examined using the measures of regularity, local dynamic stability, and variability. This study investigates the relationship between these measures under increasing cognitive loads. Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill at 1 m/s under walk only and two dual-task conditions. The secondary tasks were visuomotor cognitive games (VCG) of increasing difficulty level. The center of pressure displacement in the mediolateral direction (ML COP-D) and cognitive game performance were recorded for analysis. The following measures were calculated: (1) sample entropy (SampEn) and quantized dynamical entropy (QDE) of the ML COP-D, (2) short-term largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) of the ML COP-D, and (3) variability of inter-stride spatio-temporal gait variables. Entropy and variability measures significantly increased from walk only to both dual-task conditions. Whereas, the short-term LLE increased only during the easy VCG task. No measure was sensitive to the difficulty level of the VCG tasks. The variability of heel strike positions in the mediolateral direction was positively correlated with SampEn and QDE. However, there were no significant correlations between the short-term LLE and either variability measures or entropy measures. These findings confirm that each of these measures is representative of a different aspect of human gait dynamics.

AB  - Improvements in data storage may be constrained by the lower performance of hard disk drives (HDD) and the higher cost per gigabyte of solid-state drives (SSD). To mitigate these issues, hybrid storage architectures have been conceived. Some works evaluate the performance of storage architectures, but energy consumption is usually neglected and not simultaneously evaluated with performance. This paper presents an approach based on generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPN) for performance and energy consumption evaluation of individual and hybrid storage systems. The proposed models can represent distinct workloads and also estimate throughput, response time and energy consumption of storage systems. Experiments based on industry-standard benchmarks are adopted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB  - The eye movement data in five areas of interest (AOIs) were analyzed as follows, Head-up Display (HUD); Integrated Control Panel (ICP); Right Multiple Function Display (RMFD); Left Multiple Function Display (LMFD); and Outside of cockpit (OC). The scenario is performing an air-to-surface task to aim at a stationary target. The results show significant differences in pilots’ percentage of fixation between two interface designs on the ICP (t=-3.36, p<.005, Cohen's d=-.98); RMFD (t=-4.85, p<.001, Cohen's d=-1.55) and LMFD (t=-2.56, p<.05, Cohen's d=-.79). There were significant differences in pilots’ fixation duration between two interfaces on the HUD (t=2.64, p<.05, Cohen's d=.81); ICP (t=-3.00, p<.005, Cohen's d=-.94); RMFD (t=-5.32, p<.001, Cohen's d=-1.65) and LMFD (t=-2.77, p<.05, Cohen's d=-.92). By the application of eye tracker devices, interface designers can precisely evaluate pilots’ visual behavior among interfaces of cockpit and SA performance. In addition, extra workload might have a negative impact on pilots’ SA performance and increase the probability of operating hazards, and so there is the opportunity to compensate for the negative impact of workload through human-centered design. The current research uses eye-tracking devices to investigate pilots’ visual behaviors and interface design and has potential to facilitate system designers’ understanding of pilots’ attention distribution and situational awareness for improving the integration of cockpit designs and ultimately aviation safety.

AB  - With the emergence of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, there is a need to introduce a significant degree of flexibility, security and resilience in automation infrastructures, while keeping up with real-time requirements that are characteristic of such domains. Interestingly, many of these driving principles are the same that encouraged the adoption of virtualization technologies on the IT domain, somehow suggesting that the same benefits could be realisable for Industrial and Automation Control Systems, allowing to virtualise servers and cyber–physical system control devices. However, the suitability of using off-the-shelf hypervisor technologies to address the specific real-time requirements of automation infrastructures remains unclear, due to their focus on maximising systems throughput and capacity, often at the expense of determinism and increased latency. This work addresses this problem, presenting a discussion and an empirical evaluation on the feasibility of using general purpose off-the-shelf hypervisors to virtualise cyber–physical systems’ servers and control devices. While the evaluation concludes that some of these hypervisors are already capable of dealing with typical real-time workloads, this cannot be generalised to all types of real-time systems.

AB  - Humans imitate patently irrelevant actions known as overimitation, and rather than decreasing with age, overimitation increases with age. Whereas most overimitation research has focused on social factors associated with overimitation, comparatively little is known about the cognitive- and task-specific features that influence overimitation. Specifically, developmental contrasts between imitation and overimitation are confounded by the addition of irrelevant actions to causally necessary actions, increasing sequence length, cognitive load, and processing costs—variables known to be age dependent. We constructed a novel puzzle box task such that a four-step imitation, four-step overimitation, and two-step efficient sequence could be demonstrated using the same apparatus on video. In Experiments 1 and 2, 2.5- to 5-year-olds randomly assigned to imitation and overimitation groups performed significantly more target actions than baseline control groups. Rates of imitation and overimitation increased as a function of age, with older preschoolers outperforming younger preschoolers in both conditions. In Experiment 3, preschoolers were shown a video of an efficient two-step demonstration prior to testing. After they responded, they were shown a four-step overimitation video and were tested on the same puzzle box. Children imitated the efficient demonstration, but after watching the overimitation video, they also overimitated the irrelevant actions. Once again, older children overimitated more than younger children. Together, results show that preschoolers are faithful, flexible, and persistent overimitators. The fidelity and flexibility of overimitation are constrained not only by social factors but also by basic cognitive processes that vary across age groups. As these constraints diminish, overimitation and flexible (optimal) imitation increases.

AB  - Previous research suggests that operators with high workload can distrust and then poorly monitor automation, which has been generally inferred from automation dependence behaviors. To test automation monitoring more directly, the current study measured operators' visual attention allocation, workload, and trust toward imperfect automation in a dynamic multitasking environment. Participants concurrently performed a manual tracking task with two levels of difficulty and a system monitoring task assisted by an unreliable signaling system. Eye movement data indicate that operators allocate less visual attention to monitor automation when the tracking task is more difficult. Participants reported reduced levels of trust toward the signaling system when the tracking task demanded more focused visual attention. Analyses revealed that trust mediated the relationship between the load of the tracking task and attention allocation in Experiment 1, an effect that was not replicated in Experiment 2. Results imply a complex process underlying task load, visual attention allocation, and automation trust during multitasking. Automation designers should consider operators’ task load in multitasking workspaces to avoid reduced automation monitoring and distrust toward imperfect signaling systems.

AB  - In this work, we have demonstrated that many elements are needed on top of conventional foundry reliability knowledge to enable robust automotive products in compliance with all restrictive norms. For intrinsic reliability, both reliability models (a design compatible WLR description), and dynamic aging compensation schemes are required. For extrinsic failures, screening procedures require well documented usage and are shown in use for volume production to bring the failure rate level down below 1ppm automotive target. Altogether, the global approach developed in STMicroelectronics enable robust automotive products based on controlled and validated procedures.

AB  - We introduce the largest abdominal CT dataset (termed AbdomenAtlas) of 20,460 three-dimensional CT volumes sourced from 112 hospitals across diverse populations, geographies, and facilities. AbdomenAtlas provides 673 K high-quality masks of anatomical structures in the abdominal region annotated by a team of 10 radiologists with the help of AI algorithms. We start by having expert radiologists manually annotate 22 anatomical structures in 5,246 CT volumes. Following this, a semi-automatic annotation procedure is performed for the remaining CT volumes, where radiologists revise the annotations predicted by AI, and in turn, AI improves its predictions by learning from revised annotations. Such a large-scale, detailed-annotated, and multi-center dataset is needed for two reasons. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas provides important resources for AI development at scale, branded as large pre-trained models, which can alleviate the annotation workload of expert radiologists to transfer to broader clinical applications. Secondly, AbdomenAtlas establishes a large-scale benchmark for evaluating AI algorithms—the more data we use to test the algorithms, the better we can guarantee reliable performance in complex clinical scenarios. An ISBI & MICCAI challenge named BodyMaps: Towards 3D Atlas of Human Body was launched using a subset of our AbdomenAtlas, aiming to stimulate AI innovation and to benchmark segmentation accuracy, inference efficiency, and domain generalizability. We hope our AbdomenAtlas can set the stage for larger-scale clinical trials and offer exceptional opportunities to practitioners in the medical imaging community.

AB  - Peer review is a widely accepted mechanism for research evaluation, playing a pivotal role in academic publishing. However, criticisms have long been leveled at this mechanism, mostly because of its poor efficiency and low reproducibility. Recent years have seen the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting the peer review process. Nonetheless, with the involvement of humans, such limitations remain inevitable. In this paper, we propose the concept and pipeline of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) and review the relevant literature and technologies of achieving a full-scale computerized review process. On the basis of the review and discussion, we conclude that there is already corresponding research and preliminary implementation at each stage of ASPR. We further look into the challenges in ASPR with the existing technologies. The major difficulties lie in inadequate data, imperfect document parsing and representation, defective human–computer interaction, and flawed deep logical reasoning. Moreover, we point out the future directions and discuss the possible moral and ethical issues of ASPR. In the foreseeable future, ASPR and peer review will coexist in a reinforcing manner before ASPR is able to fully undertake the reviewing workload from humans.

AB  - Methods assessing exposure to workload calculate risk scores of individual body segments which are added up to calculate an overall risk score for the whole body. However, these methods ignore interaction effects of body segments. This may lead to inaccurate assessment of risk scores of workload. The aim of the study was to examine interaction effects of shoulder flexion angle and back angle on rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and muscle activity, and to investigate the correlation between corresponding Ovako Working Posture Analysing System (OWAS) risk scores on the one hand and RPE and muscle activity on the other. The study revealed that there is a significant interaction effect of back angle and shoulder angle on muscle activity and RPE. Furthermore, OWAS seems to correlate only with back muscle activity. Thus, integration of interaction effects to ergonomic assessment methods seems to provide a higher accuracy of risk scores.
Relevance to industry
This article introduces the relevance of interaction effects of body segments to the assessment of workload. The study revealed that isolated assessment of working postures ignores interaction effects. A consideration of interaction effects leads to a higher accuracy of risk scores quantifying exposure to workload.

AB  - Occupational exoskeletons contribute to diminish the biomechanical load during manual work. However, familiarization to the use of exoskeletons is rarely considered, which may lead to failure of acceptance and implementation. In this study, ten logistic workers underwent a 5-week progressive familiarization to a passive shoulder exoskeleton, while ten workers acted as controls. Tests pre and post the familiarization applied measurements of muscle activity and kinematics of back, neck, and shoulder, perceived effort, and usability-ratings of the exoskeleton. Exoskeleton use resulted in lower muscle activity of anterior deltoid (13–39%) and upper trapezius (16–60%) and reduced perceived effort. Additionally, it induced an offset in shoulder flexion and abduction during resting position (8–10°). No conclusions on familiarization could be drawn due to low adherence to the protocol. However, the emotions of the workers towards using the exoskeleton decreased making it questionable whether the shoulder exoskeleton is suitable for use in the logistics sector.

AB  - A topology optimization method for the design of thermal cloak is proposed. The thermal scattering theory is introduced to pre-define the initial topology of the thermal invisible cloak as two layers to reduce the number of design variables. In bilayer concentric rings, insulating and high thermal conductivity materials are used to mask heat flow and correct thermal properties. Topology optimization based on the CMA-ES strategy is applied to quickly obtain the best configuration of available materials. The influence of the thermal properties of the material on the optimal configuration and the deflection angle of the thermal flux at the boundary surface has been investigated. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the function of the optimal cloak with that of the ideal metamaterial and the single insulating layer. The results show that despite its simple structure, the bilayer scattering cloak exhibits excellent cloaking performance under different thermal boundary conditions. In this work, the perfect scattering elimination is achieved by adjusting the layer thickness ratio of the cloak with the initial defined structure rather than seeking the optimal thermal conductivity of material, so as to avoid the problem of mismatch between the actual and ideal parameters. Compared to continuous optimization method, the pre-defined bilayer structure is easy to manufacture. Our scheme introduces thermal scattering theory to pre-set the initial structure of the topology optimization method, which provides a general, convenient, and efficient means for the design and application of thermally functional materials.

AB  - Abstract:
In this paper we present an approach for improving the hand-guiding of robotic arms which is called assisting force field (AFF). The AFF guides the user to certain reference paths enabling the user to keep the desired position and orientation of the end effector. The reference paths are computed using learning data of experienced users. The AFF is realized by an impedance control of the robot. The main focus of this paper is to investigate how the AFF improves the handling of the robot. For this a user study has been performed with 42 participants. The experiments were complemented by questionnaires regarding user comfort and task workload. The results of the study show an obvious improvement on the performance and the ergonomic quantities applying the AFF.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been implemented in various applications such as gaming, e-learning, rehabilitation, etc. Although many studies have been conducted to evaluate the user experiences (UX) of various applications in VR, there are few studies evaluating the UX of VR in a holistic view. Since user experience means holistic feelings caused by attributes like efficiency, effectiveness, pleasure, and attractiveness, it is necessary to evaluate user experience in many respects, including presence, usability, and workload. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the UX of VR in four various metrics: presence, workload, usability, and flow. In this study, the user experience factor was confirmed through the previous studies comparing visual display terminals (VDT) and head-mounted displays (HMD). In addition, the UX difference between VDT and HMD in two different situations, walking and driving, is analyzed. The data of 26 participants were analyzed and found that there were significant differences in the four studied metrics related to UX. In the driving situation, the usability value was higher in VDT, whereas they were higher in HMD for walking. Comparing the two contexts in HMD, walking was significantly higher in three metrics: presence, usability, and flow. The results show that HMD is better in terms of user experience than VDT, and HMD is more suitable for walking situations than for driving situations. Through this study, in terms of user experience, it is suitable to replace walking tasks with VR when the experiment in a real-world environment is impossible.

AB  - Voluntary blink control is vital in eye-controlled human–computer interaction (ECHCI). Pressure sensors, known for their low power consumption and strong resistance to interference, are suitable for blink detection. Existing research has predominantly focused on sensor materials and signal processing, and studies on the characteristics and optimized design of voluntary blink actions in ECHCI remain relatively limited. Therefore, this study presents a blink detection system based on pressure sensors and investigates the efficiency of voluntary blink actions. We examined the effects of two independent variables, blink count (single, double, and triple) and blink side (bilateral and unilateral), on recognition accuracy and three time-related variables. Subsequently, the subjective workload and evaluation experiments were conducted for each blink action. The results indicate that the blink count has a more pronounced impact on interaction efficiency and comfort, with continuous blink actions exceeding three blinks not being recommended. Bilateral blinks were perceived as more natural and comfortable than unilateral blinks. Moreover, we discovered that the participants exhibited greater attentiveness and focus when performing double bilateral blink actions, making it suitable for important commands. Based on the experimental results, the top three recommended voluntary blink actions are single bilateral blink (SB), double bilateral blink (DB), and single unilateral blink (SU). Finally, a test involving controlling the movement of a toy car using the recommended blink actions validates the usability of the actions and detection system. These findings provide valuable guidance for the design and optimization of voluntary-blink interaction systems, further enhancing this interaction method’s feasibility.

AB  - Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) is a promising candidate for a multidimensional system modeling that can learn a probability distribution over a set of data. It is a specific type of an artificial neural network with one input (visible) and one output (hidden) layer. Recently published works demonstrate that CRBM is a suitable mechanism for modeling multidimensional time series such as human motion, workload characterization, city traffic analysis. The process of learning and inference of these systems relies on linear algebra functions like matrix–matrix multiplication, and for higher data sets, they are very compute-intensive. In this paper, we present a configurable framework for CRBM based workloads for arbitrary large models. We show how to accelerate the learning process of CRBM with FPGAs and OpenCL, and we conduct an extensive scalability study for different model sizes and system configurations. We show significant improvement in performance/Watt for large models and batch sizes (from 1.51x up to 5.71x depending on the host configuration) when we use FPGA and OpenCL for the acceleration, and limited benefits for small models comparing to the state-of-the-art CPU solution.

KW  - Muscle fatigue
AB  - Workers engaged in repetitive manual material handling (MMH) generally suffer from work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), particularly in the arms, shoulders, neck, and waist; this significantly limits the individual's strength and ability to work. Currently, research on upper-limb injuries affecting manufacturing workers focusses on the effect of different working conditions on specific muscle fatigue. However, research on the fatigue transformation relationship among various muscles in the process of working is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the fatigue changes between the upper-limb muscles during rotary handing. In this study, 13 male subjects were studied to simulate rotating handling during the manual handling process using surface electromyography (sEMG). Handling angles of 90°, 45°, and 0° were arranged as single variables to conduct the single-factor experiment. The sEMG of the brachioradialis, biceps brachii, trapezius, and multifidus muscle was measured during the operation. The results of this study indicate that the characteristics of muscle fatigue are different at different rotation angles: the multifidus muscle and trapezius were fatigued when the rotation was 90°. Under the condition of a 45° rotation, the activities of the four muscles fluctuated significantly. The slope of the median frequency of the muscles was positive, the load of the four muscles was evenly distributed, and no local fatigue was observed. Under the condition of a 0° rotation, the sEMG indicated that the brachioradialis muscle was fatigued, while the other three muscles had lower loads.

AB  - In two studies, we evaluated the trust and usefulness of automated compared to manual parking using an experimental paradigm and also by surveying owners of vehicles with automated parking features. In Study 1, we compared participants' ability to manually park a Tesla Model X to their use of the Autopark feature to complete perpendicular and parallel parking maneuvers. We investigated differences in parking success and duration, intervention behavior, self-reported levels of trust in and workload associated with the automation, as well as eye and head movements related to monitoring the automation. We found higher levels of trust in the automated parallel parking maneuvers compared to perpendicular parking. The Tesla’s automated perpendicular parking was found to be less efficient than manually executing this maneuver. Study 2 investigated the frequency with which owners of vehicles with automated parking features used those features and probed why they chose not to use them. Vehicle owners reported low use of any automated parking feature. Owners further reported using their vehicle's autonomous parking features in ways consistent with the empirical findings from Study 1: higher usage rates of autonomous parallel parking. The results from both studies revealed that 1) automated parking is error-prone, 2) drivers nonetheless have calibrated trust in the automated parking system, and 3) the benefits of automated parallel parking surpass those of automated perpendicular parking with the current state of the technology.

AB  - The cardiovascular system in mammals follows various optimization criteria covering the heart, the vascular network, and the coupling of the two. Through a simple dimensional analysis we arrived at a non-dimensional number (wave condition number) that can predict the optimum wave state in which the left ventricular (LV) pulsatile power (LV workload) is minimized in a mammalian cardiovascular system. This number is also universal among all mammals independent of animal size maintaining a value of around 0.1. By utilizing a unique in vitro model of human aorta, we tested our hypothesis against a wide range of aortic compliance (pulse wave velocity). We concluded that the optimum value of the wave condition number remains to be around 0.1 for a wide range of aorta compliance that we could simulate in our in-vitro system.

AB  - One of the most critical phases in complex systems design is the requirements engineering process. During this phase, system designers need to accurately elicit, model and validate the desired system based on user requirements. Smart driver assistive technologies (SDAT) belong to a class of complex systems that are used to alleviate accident risk by improving situation awareness, reducing driver workload or enhancing driver attentiveness. Such systems aim to draw drivers’ attention on critical information cues that improve decision making. Discovering the requirements for such systems necessitates a holistic approach that addresses not only functional and non-functional aspects but also the human requirements such as drivers’ situation awareness and workload. This work describes a simulation-based user requirements discovery method. It utilizes the benefits of a modular virtual reality simulator to model driving conditions to discover user needs that subsequently inform the design of prototype SDATs that exploit the augmented reality method. Herein, we illustrate the development of the simulator, the elicitation of user needs through an experiment and the prototype SDAT designs using UNITY game engine.

AB  - Studying human behavior is of particular interest within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as it can provide insight into human performance. Prior HCI research suggests that mouse and keyboard monitoring may provide a more complete picture of user behavior under high cognitive loads like decision making and developing tasks. In this exploratory study we investigate the potential correlation between mouse behavioral patterns or keystroke dynamics and a set of End-User Development (EUD) behavioral attributes. We conduct a field test on 30 end-users interacting with a modern web-based EUD tool for the construction of simple web forms. Our findings reveal the existence of several significant correlations between end-users’ behavioral attributes and mouse pattern metrics or keystroke dynamics during the development process. Mouse pattern metrics like random and straight movements, mouse hovers, etc., can be associated with perceived ease use, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, willingness to learn or risk-perception. Similarly, some keystroke dynamics like key press speed and down-to-down time can be associated with perceived ease of use or self-efficacy. The findings of this work show a new interesting research direction and may motivate the EUD research community to study further the end-users’ mouse and keyboard behavior in today's web-based EUD systems.

AB  - Zero trust cybersecurity is beginning to replace traditional perimeter-based security strategies and is being adopted by organizations across a wide range of industries. However, the implementation of zero trust is a complex undertaking, different from traditional perimeter-based security, and requires a fresh approach in terms of its management. As such, a clear set of critical success factors (CSFs) will help organizations to better plan, assess, and manage their zero trust cybersecurity. In response, we investigated the CSFs for implementing zero trust cybersecurity by conducting a three-round Delphi study to obtain the consensus from a panel of 12 cybersecurity experts. We built a multi-dimensional CSFs framework that comprises eight dimensions, namely identity, endpoint, application and workload, data, network, infrastructure, visibility and analytics, and automation and orchestration. Based on the CSFs, we developed a maturity assessment framework enabling organizations to evaluate their zero trust maturity. This paper contributes to a theoretical understanding of how to deploy zero trust from multiple dimensions and offers a viable guidance framework for organizations from a practical perspective. This paper is useful for organizational stakeholders who are in the process of planning, reviewing, or implementing zero trust cybersecurity.

AB  - The Air Traffic Control (ATC) environment is complex and safety-critical. Whilst exchanging information with pilots, controllers must also be alert to visual notifications displayed on the radar screen (e.g., warning which indicates a loss of minimum separation between aircraft). Under the assumption that attentional resources are shared between vision and hearing, the visual interface design may also impact the ability to process these auditory stimuli. Using a simulated ATC task, we compared the behavioral and neural responses to two different visual notification designs—the operational alarm that involves blinking colored “ALRT” displayed around the label of the notified plane (“Color-Blink”), and the more salient alarm involving the same blinking text plus four moving yellow chevrons (“Box-Animation”). Participants performed a concurrent auditory task with the requirement to react to rare pitch tones. P300 from the occurrence of the tones was taken as an indicator of remaining attentional resources. Participants who were presented with the more salient visual design showed better accuracy than the group with the suboptimal operational design. On a physiological level, auditory P300 amplitude in the former group was greater than that observed in the latter group. One potential explanation is that the enhanced visual design freed up attentional resources which, in turn, improved the cerebral processing of the auditory stimuli. These results suggest that P300 amplitude can be used as a valid estimation of the efficiency of interface designs, and of cognitive load more generally.

AB  - Automated vehicles need to prioritize pedestrian safety. One way to achieve this is through external human–machine interfaces (eHMIs) that send visual signals to pedestrians. eHMIs can be either text-based or light-based. However, there has been limited research on the effects of these types of eHMI on human information processing and attention allocation. This study aimed to fill this gap by using a gaze-contingent approach, which blurs the view outside a circular aperture, to test the hypothesis that text-based eHMIs, which require focused or foveal attention, result in longer response times compared to light-based eHMIs, which can be understood using peripheral vision. In this study, 23 participants watched animated video clips of traffic situations involving automated vehicles with either no eHMI, a flashing-light eHMI, or a text-based eHMI. Their eye movements were tracked, and they were asked to press the spacebar when they felt it was safe to cross the road. The results showed faster response times when an eHMI was present, with no significant difference between the two types of eHMIs. Further analysis suggested that the flashing-light eHMI captured attention briefly, while the text-based eHMI held attention for a longer period. When no eHMI was present, participants focused on the approaching vehicle for the longest time. The gaze-contingent window resulted in fewer eye movements and slower response times. In conclusion, the study showed that the gaze-contingent window negatively affected response times and eye movements, emphasizing the importance of considering peripheral vision when designing eHMIs for pedestrian safety.

AB  - Engineer To Order (ETO) companies have to face the difficulty to manage high uncertainty in customer requirements, and, consequently, to organize all the activities for efficiently and effectively answering customer orders. In these contexts, planning the activities of design, production and assembly departments is a complex task, also given the variability of lead times and the difficulties in forecasting resources workload. Literature has mainly devoted attention to planning tools for standardized make to stock environments, often neglecting ETO companies’ needs. This paper aims to present a methodology for supporting design, production and assembly planning in an ETO context. The methodology combines project requirements planning with lean management tools, i.e. Asaichi and visual control and management tools. It has been successfully applied in a company showing its potential for increasing planning performance, company flexibility and, in the end, delivery performance.

AB  - With enhancement of technology downscaling and packaging allows us to put more and more transistors within the same chip area. The Moore’s law still shows the growth in yield with increasing transistor density in deep sub-micron. This increment in transistor density encourages the computer architects to design Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) systems. In recent times, industry and researchers are focusing to add more cores per chip with increasing integration. The sharp growth in core numbers in System-on-Chip (SoC) raise intense challenges for communication among the cores. The scalability, fault tolerance and higher communication bandwidth features made Network-on-chip (NoC), a popular communication architecture than conventional bus architecture. However, the rapid shrinking of CMOS design margins in deep submicron technology has made aging mechanism such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI), a prime concern in NoC design. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-silicon, NBTI stress aware circuit-to-system level solution for a reliable NoC router. To achieve reliability objective, we develop an NBTI aging-aware timing analysis framework based on the real workload stress. Our proposal is based on findings of most stressed path and cells due to NBTI induced effects. We develop an aging-aware cell library and used the multi Vdd technique to mitigate the NBTI induced delay effects. On the basis of volume of experimental analysis, we observed that 66.67% delay increases due to NBTI induced aging effects with real workload stress for a duration of five years. Our proposed NBTI stress mitigation algorithm and technique could able to reduce aging induced delay effects by 36%, hence enhancing the router performance under stress.

AB  - Big data processing frameworks such as Spark usually provide a large number of performance-related configuration parameters, how to auto-tune these parameters for a better performance has been a hot issue in academia as well as industry for years. Through delicately tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is currently the most appealing algorithm to achieve configuration auto-tuning. However, considering the tuning cost constraint in practice, there are three critical limitations preventing conventional BO-based approaches from being directly applied into auto-tuning cluster-based big data frameworks. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient configuration auto-tuning approach named TurBO for big data frameworks based on two enhancements of vanilla BO:1) To reduce the essential iteration times, TurBO integrates a well-designed adaptive pseudo point mechanism with BO; 2) To avoid the time-consuming practical evaluation of sub-optimal configurations as possible, TurBO leverages the proposed CASampling method to intelligently tackle with these sub-optimal configurations based on ensemble learning with historical tuning experiences. To evaluate the performance of TurBO, we conducted a series of experiments on a local Spark cluster with 9 different HiBench benchmark applications. Overall, compared with 3 representative BO-based baseline approaches OpenTuner, Bliss and ResTune, TurBO is able to speedup the tuning procedures respectively by 2.24×, 2.29× and 1.97× on average. Besides, TurBO can always achieve a positive cumulative performance gain under the simulated dynamic workload scenario, which means TurBO is indeed appropriate for workload changes of big data applications.

AB  - Recent advancements in robotics and deep learning (DL) have made it possible to implement robots in civil infrastructures' quality defect inspection. Robots can reduce human inspectors' workloads and enhance inspection results' reliability by collecting data and automatically identifying quality defects from the raw data. However, current methods for training DL models rely on centralized strategies that require the aggregation of defect data (e.g., uploading to a cloud server), posing concerns about data privacy and security. Thus, this study proposes a three-fold federated learning (FL) framework for training DL models collaboratively, without the need to share local data among construction robots. The framework is specifically applied to image-based crack segmentation, critical for ensuring infrastructures’ safety and serviceability. A lightweight DL model is developed to enable easy implementation on resource-constrained construction robots and to reduce communication costs during federated training. Experimental results show that the proposed FL method outperforms traditional centralized methods. The critical contribution of this study is the hierarchical FL framework, which enables construction robots to leverage big data in a privacy-preserving manner.

AB  - Summary
Human working memory is greatly facilitated by linguistic representations—for example, by verbal rehearsal and by verbal recoding of novel stimuli. The absence of language in nonhumans raises questions about the extent to which nonhuman working memory includes similar mechanisms. There is strong evidence for rehearsal-like active maintenance in working memory when monkeys are tested with highly familiar stimuli, but not when tested with novel stimuli, suggesting that working memory depends on the existence of previously encoded representations. This difference in working memory for familiar and novel images may exist because, lacking language, monkeys cannot recode novel stimuli in a way that permits active maintenance in working memory. Alternatively, working memory for novel images may have been present, but behaviorally silent, in earlier studies. In tests with novel images, the high familiarity of to-be-remembered stimuli compared to never-before-seen distractors may be such a strong determinant of recognition performance that evidence of working memory is obscured. In the current study, we developed a technique for attenuating the utility of relative familiarity as a mnemonic signal in recognition tests with novel stimuli. In tests with novel images, we observed impairments of memory by concurrent cognitive load and delay interval that indicate actively maintained working memory. This flexibility in monkey working memory suggests that monkeys may recode unfamiliar stimuli to facilitate working memory and establishes new parallels between verbal human working memory and nonverbal nonhuman primate working memory.

AB  - The MRO industry faces substantial challenges with regard to the capacity planning of disassembly and reassembly work. This is due to the unknown workloads when regenerating complex investment goods and is caused, in particular, by the uncertain degree of disassembly and the complex challenges of reassembly. Forecasting techniques based on Bayesian networks are developed along with mathematical models which optimize capacity utilization, job order and the resulting costs. The approaches are tested and validated in conjunction with an MRO company with global operations. The results show possibilities for enhancing the planning processes and are found to be transferable on an international scale regardless of sociocultural and process differences.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to examine the role of fatigue and crew endurance in human performance of Carrier Sortie requirements; this mission capability involves high-stakes, high-demand, high-tempo operations in a challenging maritime environment. The researchers engaged with a panel of Nimitz crewmembers for a discussion of workload, notional schedules, and endurance risk factors. Workload was examined with models that consider the human capacity for sustaining. The investigation found that more attention is paid to physical fatigue, compared to cognitive or mental fatigue. Crewmembers emphasized that crew has a “can do” attitude to combat fatigue; the crew stated that “pride and adrenaline overpower fatigue…plus coffee and Red Bull.” They indicated that this results in good initiative, but at times bad judgment while trying to accomplish the work. The current research posits that fatigue is likely to reduce the ability of crewmembers to tolerate sustained performance and associated increased physiological and cognitive costs. However, the authors also recognize the limits of fatigue science with regard to predicting human capacity in intense operational and combat conditions. There is much anecdotal information to suggest that sailors are managing fatigue despite the predictions of various fatigue models. As a result, we cannot yet predict with certainty when the accumulated workload and fatigue of the individual sailor will be untenable, or identify critical thresholds of degraded cognitive capacity and decision making. Rather than rely solely on fatigue prediction software, it is recommended that potential mitigations are considered that might provide the crew more tools to manage endurance as a fatigue abatement strategy. The development of a crew endurance program to mitigate the risks posed by fatigue and reduced alertness during carrier sortie operations would identify risks relating to fatigue and alertness, and generate solutions to mitigate these risks by controlling exposure to endurance risk factors during normal operations so that the crew will be better prepared to respond to any operational demand.

AB  - The number of automated vehicles (AVs) is expected to successively increase in the near future. This development has a considerable impact on the informal communication between AVs and pedestrians. Informal communication with the driver will become obsolete during the interaction with AVs. Literature suggests that external human machine interfaces (eHMIs) might substitute the communication between drivers and pedestrians. In the study, we additionally test a recently discussed type of communication in terms of artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch motion, as an informal communication cue for AVs. N = 54 participants approached AVs in a virtual inner-city traffic environment. We explored the effect of three communication concepts: an artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch motion, eHMI and the combination of both. Moreover, vehicle types (sports car, limousine, SUV) were varied. A mixed-method approach was applied to investigate the participantś crossing behavior and subjective safety feeling. Furthermore, eye movement parameters were recorded as indicators for mental workload. The results revealed that any communication concept drove beneficial effects on the crossing behavior. The participants crossed the road earlier when an active pitch motion was present, as this was interpreted as a stronger braking. Further, the eHMI and a combination of eHMI and active pitch motion had a positive effect on the crossing behavior. The active pitch motion showed no effect on the subjective safety feeling, while eHMI and the combination enhanced the pedestrianś safety feeling while crossing. The use of communication resulted in less mental workload, as evidenced by eye-tracking parameters. Variations of vehicle types did not result in significant main effects but revealed interactions between parameters. The active pitch motion revealed no learning. In contrast, it took participants several trials for the eHMI and the combination condition to affect their crossing behavior. To sum up, this study indicates that communication between AVs and pedestrians can benefit from the consideration of vehicle motion.

AB  - Wide-ranging edge cloud data centers are a vital part of the solution for the problems caused by enormous growth in the IT industry for high computational power by advanced service applications. Majority of IoT applications switched to the Cloud and this stimulated the emergence of Edge technology to better manage the computing applications, data, resource and services. Consequently, with the massive client size and enormous applications trying to benefit from the cloud service, it makes it a challenging task for the edge cloud data centers to work in a power saving mode. In this paper, we propose a virtual machine consolidation method to switch the idle physical servers into hibernation mode, resulting in reduced power usage. We know that edge cloud data centers offer storage as a service, in this study we address the issues pertaining to storage units in the data centers. A unique classification approach is adopted to ensure load is balanced accordingly during allocation and our main contribution is on the VM migration technique. The VM migration is aimed at consolidating the VMs based on the workload to reduced number of physical machines to mitigate the energy consumption and promoting green computing. Therefore, we name the approach as Workload Aware Virtual Machine Consolidation Method (WAVMCM). We validate the proposed method with a competitive analysis of experimental results gathered from comparing it with Artificial Intelligence based probabilistic algorithm like Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm and a case of no migration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WAVMCM reduces 9% active servers saving 15% of power consumption when compared to genetic algorithm based method.
