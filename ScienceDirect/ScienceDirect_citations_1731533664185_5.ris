AB  - In the software industry, the class complexity of an object oriented programis measured using various factors such as counting the number of lines of code, methods, attributes, functional points, etc.,. Many researchers propose the class complexity metrics for object oriented design. Aloysius et al., has proposed a class complexity metric called Attribute Weighted Class Complexity (AWCC) from Extended Weighted Class Complexity (EWCC).The metric AWCC was calculated by adding the complexity of methods, attributes and complexity due to inheritance. The main limitation of AWCC is that on calculating inherited complexity, the Cognitive Load (CL) assigned to Lth level in inheritance hierarchy was assumed to be 1 always, but the cognitive load to understand the different levels ofinheritance can’t be same. So, there is a need for a metric to overcoming the limitations of AWCC. Hence, a new metric namely Cognitive Weighted Inheritance Class complexity (CWICC) is proposed in this paper. In CWICC, cognitive weights are assigned for each level of inheritance and also calculate the complexity due to the reusing of different types of attributes. The proposed metric has been validated empirically and also theoretically by using the properties of Weyuker’s. The result is matched with otherexisting measures and it shows that the proposed metric is to be a more appropriate indicator to measure the complexity of the class.

AB  - Effective integration, use, and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare system will require human factors considerations and a systems approach in addition to predictive accuracy. This exploratory study focuses on clinicians' perception of the role of accountability, training and their impact on the intention of using AI and associated decision making. The study also captures the perception of clinicians on the role of AI on workload, trustworthiness, risk, and performance expectancy. A semi-structured survey, including itemized and open-ended questions, was distributed to healthcare practitioners working in the United States. Data were collected using an audience paneling company. A screening question exclusively selected healthcare professionals working actively within the United States of America. The study leveraged sequential regression and inductive content analysis to analyze quantitative and qualitative survey responses. Two hundred and sixty-five participants completed the survey. The findings showed a significant impact of various variables, including perceived workload, perceived trustworthiness of AI, perceived risk of AI, and willingness to receive AI training on using AI. Lack of AI accountability was also identified as an inhibiting factor in AI use. Lastly, the study found that performance expectancy, perceived risk, and trustworthiness influence practitioners’ perception of AI's impact on decision-making.

KW  - Free-form surface machining

KW  - Discretization calculation method
AB  - Ball-end mills are commonly employed for semi-finishing and finishing of complex surfaces, widely utilized in the energy, automotive, aerospace and other industries. During surface machining, cutter workpiece engagement (CWE) area of the ball-end mill continuously varies with surface characteristics and the tool paths. Additionally, the actual position of the tool involved in cutting also changes, leading to uneven wear distribution on the ball-end mill, making tool wear prediction and evaluation challenging. In this paper, a discretization calculation method of tool path length for surface machining is proposed based on PowerMill post-processing development. The linear cutting length of tool path for each corresponding tool posture is calculated, and the approximate calculation model of average milling distance of single tooth for cutting edge element is established. The correlation mapping between NC machining program, tool posture and cutting workload of cutting edge element is realized. A tool wear model that considers effective cutting distance is developed, enabling the prediction of wear distribution along the flank of the ball-end mill under the surface machining conditions. Comparative experiments were conducted on tool wear under different feed directions during curved surface machining. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ball-end mill wear prediction method.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based Ambient Assisted Living systems play an important role in smart cities by improving the quality of life of the elderly population. Many Ambient Assisted Living systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes. Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for Android Apps. The proposed algorithms can improve the privacy protection of Ambient Assisted Living App users in smart cities and relieve them through cognitive offloading.

AB  - As semiconductor manufacturing technology continues to improve, it is possible to integrate more and more transistors onto a single processor. Many-core processor design has resulted in part from the search to utilize this enormous transistor real estate. The Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC) is an experimental many-core processor created by Intel Labs. In this paper we present a study in which we analyze this innovative many-core system by running several workloads with distinctive parallelism characteristics. We investigate the effect on system performance by monitoring specific hardware performance counters. Then, we experiment on varying different hardware configuration parameters such as number of cores, clock frequency and voltage levels. We execute the chosen workloads and collect the timing, power consumption and energy consumption information on such a many-core research platform. Thus, we can comprehensively analyze the behavior and scalability of the Intel SCC system with the introduced workload in terms of performance and energy consumption. Our results show that the profiled parallel workload execution has a communication bottleneck on the Intel SCC system. Moreover, our results indicate that we should carefully choose the number of cores to execute different workloads in order to yield a balance between execution performance and energy efficiency for different applications.

AB  - Most investigations into the negative effects of viewing stereoscopic 3D content on human health have addressed 3D visual fatigue and visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). Very few, however, have looked into changes in autonomic balance and heart rhythm, which are homeostatic factors that ought to be taken into consideration when assessing the overall impact of 3D video viewing on human health. In this study, 30 participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one group watching a 2D video, (2D-group) and the other watching a 3D video (3D-group). The subjects in the 3D-group showed significantly increased heart rates (HR), indicating arousal, and an increased VLF/HF (Very Low Frequency/High Frequency) ratio (a measure of autonomic balance), compared to those in the 2D-group, indicating that autonomic balance was not stable in the 3D-group. Additionally, a more disordered heart rhythm pattern and increasing heart rate (as determined by the R-peak to R-peak (RR) interval) was observed among subjects in the 3D-group compared to subjects in the 2D-group, further indicating that 3D viewing induces lasting activation of the sympathetic nervous system and interrupts autonomic balance.

AB  - Both cell design and human issues are important factors for successful implementation of cellular manufacturing. To better implement cellular manufacturing, we investigate the integrated cell formation and worker assignment problem (ICFWAP). A comprehensive linear model is developed for the ICFWAP to determine the optimal allocation of machines, parts and workers. Specific characteristics of this model include the simultaneous consideration of production planning, coexistence of alternative process routings, lot splitting, workload balancing between cells and worker over-assignment to multiple cells. Motivated by the inefficiency of exact approaches, this paper proposes a hybrid approach combining combinatorial particle swarm optimization and linear programming (CPSO-LP) to efficiently solve real-sized problems. In CPSO-LP, decision variables corresponding to part routing selection and part operation assignment are fixed and other variables are allowed to be changed. CPLEX is then used to solve the reduced LP problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed model. Results reveal that worker over-assignment can reduce the number of workers hired and improve labor utilization rate. The better efficiency and effectiveness of CPSO-LP are proved by comparisons with CPLEX, a genetic algorithm (GA), CPSO, and a hybrid approach combining GA and LP.

AB  - Knowledge-representation and reasoning methods have been extensively researched within Artificial Intelligence. Among these, argumentation has emerged as an ideal paradigm for inference under uncertainty with conflicting knowledge. Its value has been predominantly demonstrated via analyses of the topological structure of graphs of arguments and its formal properties. However, limited research exists on the examination and comparison of its inferential capacity in real-world modelling tasks and against other knowledge-representation and non-monotonic reasoning methods. This study is focused on a novel comparison between defeasible argumentation and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning when applied to the representation of the ill-defined construct of human mental workload and its assessment. Different argument-based and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning models have been designed considering knowledge-bases of incremental complexity containing uncertain and conflicting information provided by a human reasoner. Findings showed how their inferences have a moderate convergent and face validity when compared respectively to those of an existing baseline instrument for mental workload assessment, and to a perception of mental workload self-reported by human participants. This confirmed how these models also reasonably represent the construct under consideration. Furthermore, argument-based models had on average a lower mean squared error against the self-reported perception of mental workload when compared to fuzzy-reasoning models and the baseline instrument. The contribution of this research is to provide scholars, interested in formalisms on knowledge-representation and non-monotonic reasoning, with a novel approach for empirically comparing their inferential capacity.

AB  - Particle-based spatial discretization methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) possess suitability for the high-fidelity simulation of laser manufacturing processes due to their capability in treating complex free-surface and multiphase problems. In such simulations, laser heat source modeling remains a central concern as the mechanisms governing the material deformations and phase changes strongly depend on the input laser energy and its distribution details. Ray tracing (RT) is a realistic and accurate approach for high-fidelity heat source modeling that can capture surface heterogeneity and multiple reflections. However, RT heat source modeling for particle-based numerical methods faces additional challenges rooted in the lack of explicit surface representation, intensive computational efforts, and implementation complexities. This work addresses these issues by proposing an enhanced and efficient RT heat source model for particle-based laser manufacturing simulations with negligible computational overhead and without requiring background nodes or surface mesh reconstruction. After validating the RT heat source model versus analytical and experimental results, we assess its computational performance through two test cases, showing that the computing workload imposed by our RT model is between 0.1% and 25% of the total runtime in different SPH-based laser manufacturing simulations. With the achieved efficiency and robustness, it becomes convenient yet advantageous to simulate processes like laser drilling and laser powder bed fusion with precision far beyond the conventional approaches using volumetric heat sources.

AB  - Strong coupling between autonomous transportation and production activities deeply influences planning and scheduling in smart factories, particularly in dynamic environments with rapid changes. This study addresses the dynamic flexible job shop schedule problem with transportation resources (DFJSPT) in which new job insertion, the most common unexpected event in a manufacturing system, is treated as a dynamic disturbance. A proactive-reactive methodology is adopted to respond to dynamic disturbances. Correspondingly, a two-stage multi-objective mixed-integer programming model is formulated for the proposed DFJSPT. In the initial scheduling stage, the model aims to minimize makespan and workload imbalance. In the rescheduling stage, instability minimisation is introduced to deal with the impact of the disturbance. To solve this complex problem, a multi-objective adaptive large neighbourhood search (MOALNS) algorithm is developed. Its novel heuristic operators supporting multi-objective optimization are designed to explore the neighbourhood of a solution. Moreover, the amount of domination between the solutions from the Archive is applied in the acceptance criteria. Overall, we validate the efficiency of the developed model and algorithm through a number of numerical experiments. The computational results verify the accuracy of the mathematical model and demonstrate the superiority of MOALNS in several aspects, including convergence, diversity, and the ability to search for high-quality solutions. In addition to its effectiveness, the algorithm is able to handle dynamic events flexibly, which makes it a suitable option for real-world applications of the DFJSPT.

AB  - Flexible job-shop scheduling is considerably important in the modern intelligent manufacturing factory. In a real job shop, transportation and setup times account for a large percentage of the total processing flow, and with today's companies demanding higher delivery times, the feasibility and punctuality of scheduling will be considerably reduced if these time constraints are ignored. Recently, several companies have become green in their manufacturing processes. However, transportation, setup, and delivery times have rarely been combined with energy efficiency. To solve this problem, we employed an integer programming approach to develop a complete mathematical model of the problem and simultaneously optimized four objectives: maximum completion time, total energy consumption, workload of critical machines, and penalties for earliness/tardiness. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm incorporating reinforcement learning was proposed to solve the model. The algorithm had the following features: (1) four initialization strategies were designed to obtain high-quality populations; (2) a reinforcement learning-based parameter-adaptive strategy was proposed to guide the population to select the best parameters; (3) a critical path-based neighborhood structure with transportation and setup times was designed, and according to the objectives of this study, four additional neighborhood structures were designed; (4) a reference point-based non-dominated sorting selection was presented to guide the solution toward the Pareto-optimal front; and (5) an external archive was proposed to enhance the utilization of abandoned historical solutions. Finally, the effectiveness of this algorithm was demonstrated using 33 benchmark instances of variants and comparison experiments.

AB  - Mental workload assessment of the operators in some safety-critical human-machine systems is an important research topic. In this paper, an experiment was designed to obtain the electroencephalogram (EEG) data under three levels of mental workload. The EEG data of multiple subjects were used for the mental workload classification based on the stochastic configuration network (SCN). The subject-specific classifiers (SSCs) were built by the individual EEG data. The results showed that the range of SSC test accuracy was between 56.5 % and 90.2 % with an average of 75.9 %. The SSC accuracy had a positive correlation with the operating accuracy (r = 0.852, p < 0.01). For comparison, the subject-multiple classifiers (SMCs) were established with the EEG data of multiple subjects. The results showed that the SSCs had a lower time-consuming and higher prediction accuracy than the SMCs. But the SMCs might embody the trend of statistical performance for a large number of subjects. This study provided an effective modeling method for the classification of mental workload, and it would bring great convenience to the practical application in the future.

AB  - To enhance the efficiency and safety of interactions with pedestrians, numerous external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) concepts for automated vehicles (AVs) have been proposed and evaluated, predominately based on singular pedestrian-AV interaction scenarios. This leaves a gap in comprehending the efficiency and robustness of eHMIs during interactions with scalable AVs. To bridge the gap, this study pioneers an exploration of pedestrians' road-crossing decisions, perceived clarity, and gaze behaviour during synchronous interactions with multiple AVs equipped with different eHMIs. An eye-tracking experiment was conducted, involving 48 video stimuli depicting two AVs (with yielding patterns and eHMIs manipulated) approaching a predetermined road-crossing location from the same side of a two-way, four-lane, un-signalized road. Each yielding AV will present one of four eHMI manipulations (i.e., light band, smiling expression, pedestrian symbol, and no eHMI as baseline), resulting in 16 unique eHMI combinations and video stimuli. Eighty-seven participants were recruited and tasked to respond to approaching AVs, during which their road-crossing decision time, perceived clarity, and gaze metrics were recorded. Findings revealed that different eHMIs across AVs were associated with prolonged road-crossing decision times, diminished perceived clarity, and intensified visual attention as evidenced by increased fixation counts and durations. Regarding AVs equipped with the same eHMIs, the pedestrian symbol-based eHMIs resulted in heightened clarity perception, reduced crossing decision times and visual engagement, in contrast to eHMIs presented in abstract light bands or smiling expressions. Furthermore, for eHMI-different AVs, those featuring only one eHMI within AVL-AVR pairs were perceived as less clear, eliciting heightened visual cognitive load and decision times. Integration of a pedestrian symbol-based eHMI in AVL-AVR configurations garnered superior clarity ratings and facilitated time savings. These findings of this pioneering study provide insights for eHMI design for future AVs in complex traffic scenarios with scalable road users.

However, in this jungle of frameworks, the performance evaluation of these technologies is not a trivial task, and strictly depends on the application requirements. The scope of this paper is to compare two of the most employed and promising frameworks to manage big data: Apache Flink and Apache Hive, which are general purpose distributed platforms under the umbrella of the Apache Software Foundation. To evaluate these two frameworks we use the benchmark BigBench, developed for Apache Hive. We re-implemented the most significant queries of Apache Hive BigBench to make them work on Apache Flink, in order to be able to compare the results of the same queries executed on both frameworks. Our results show that Apache Flink, if it is configured well, is able to outperform Apache Hive.

AB  - Industry 4.0 depicts the fourth industrial revolution which prompts an insightful, associated and decentralized manufacturing. The prime viewpoint is an uninterrupted linkage between decision-makers, machines, and products during the manufacturing process empowered by the digital framework. The prime objective is to analyze the optimal design of fault-tolerant machining system with various types of machining hindrance. In this article, we investigate fault-tolerant redundant repairable machining system which is an indispensable part of computer and communication systems, manufacturing and production systems, security systems, etc. Besides the random failure of operating units and standby units, probabilistic common cause failure of the machining system, an automatic switch of the available standby unit in place of a failed operating unit with a significant switching lag is a key concern in the present study with unpredictable switching failure and reboot delay. The workload is shared in general with M operating units but continues in short mode as overload until there are at least M−K units in the system with the degradable failure rate. Numerical simulation, comparative analyses and optimal analyses of queue characteristics are also performed significantly and the conclusion is drawn for system designers and decision-makers to develop state-of-the-art maintenance and repair policies.

AB  - With technological developments in robotics and their increasing deployment, human-robot teams are set to be a mainstay in the future. To develop robots that possess teaming capabilities, such as being able to communicate implicitly, the present study implemented a closed-loop system. This system enabled the robot to provide adaptive aid without the need for explicit commands from the human teammate, through the use of multiple physiological workload measures. Such measures of workload vary in sensitivity and there is large inter-individual variability in physiological responses to imposed taskload. Workload models enacted via closed-loop system should accommodate such individual variability. The present research investigated the effects of the adaptive robot aid vs. imposed aid on performance and workload. Results showed that adaptive robot aid driven by an individualized workload model for physiological response resulted in greater improvements in performance compared to aid that was simply imposed by the system.

AB  - The focus is on workload control, a production planning and control technique that reduces and stabilizes the total throughput time. In these conditions, defining realistic delivery dates should become easier, yet the use of basic techniques often proves to be ineffective. Hence, we propose using statistical and/or neural network techniques to estimate, starting from the current workload of the job shop, the expected lead time of entry jobs, and to use this estimation to define reliable delivering dates. To test the approach, we simulated a 6-machines job-shop and we make predictions using a multi-regressive linear model and a multi-layer neural network. In terms of tardy jobs, both approaches performed very well, with the neural network providing the best results.

AB  - Health information technology (IT) is a promising way to achieve safer medication management in the delivery of healthcare. However, human factors/ergonomics dictates that in order to make the complex, cognitive work of healthcare delivery safer, health IT must properly support human cognition. This means, for example, that new health IT must reduce, not increase, workload during safety-critical tasks. The present study was the first to quantitatively assess the short- and long-term impact of bar coded medication administration (BCMA) IT on nurses' mental workload as well as on perceived medication safety. One-hundred seventy registered nurses across 3 dissimilar clinical units at an academic, freestanding pediatric hospital in the Midwest US participated in surveys administered before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the hospital implemented BCMA. Nurses rated their external mental workload (interruptions, divided attention, being rushed) and internal mental workload (concentration, mental effort) during medication administration tasks as well as the likelihood of each of three medication safety events: medication administration errors, medication errors on the clinical unit, and clinical unit-level adverse drug events. Clinical unit differences were assessed. Findings generally confirmed the hypothesis that external but not internal mental workload was associated with the perceived likelihood of a medication safety event. Comparisons of mental workload from pre- to post-BCMA revealed statistically significant changes in the critical care unit only. Medication safety appeared to improve over the long term in the hematology/oncology unit only. In the critical care and medical/surgical units, medication safety exhibited short-term improvements that were eliminated over time. Changes in mental workload and medication safety, two classically microergonomic constructs, were deeply embedded in macroergonomic phenomena. These included the fit between the BCMA system and the nature of nursing work, the process of BCMA implementation, and BCMA interactions with concurrent changes occurring in the hospital. Findings raise questions about achieving sustainable performance improvement with health IT as well as the balance between micro- and macroergonomic approaches to studying technology change.
Relevance to industry
Designers must consider how technology changes cognitive work, including mental workload. Hospitals and other implementers of technology must ensure that new technology fits its users, their tasks, and the context of use, which may entail tailoring implementation, for example, to specific clinical units. Evaluators must look over time to assess both changes in cognitive work and implementation issues. Healthcare practitioners must also recognize that new technology means a complex transformation to an already complex sociotechnical system, which calls for a macroergonomic approach to design and analysis.

AB  - Despite the rapid growth of the Internet industry, the provision of full Internet service to remote regions is still challenging. As a solution, the combination of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is gaining attention. However, considering the high speed of LEO satellites in network environments remains a significant challenge. To this end, this paper introduces a dynamic computation offloading and resource allocation framework in the LEO satellite MEC architecture. Using Lyapunov optimization, we propose an efficient DCOOL algorithm to minimize average power consumption and propagation delay constrained by queue stability. Finally, comparative analysis and simulations demonstrate the superior performance of DCOOL while achieving lower power consumption and stable workload processing.

AB  - Many jobs like outdoor work and emergency rescue have to be exposed to extremely cold environments. The combined effects of the cold exposure and work intensity on human cognitive performance remain unclear. In this paper, the experiments of six Chinese young men exposed to an extremely cold environment (-10 °C) were conducted in a climatic chamber. The work intensity level was graded according to the metabolic rate corresponding to three walking speeds. Nine cognitive functions and one perceived were recorded to evaluate the subjects’ cognitive performance, including NCTB (seven items), Stroop, and RPE were measured. The increase of workload from moderate to high could lead to the acceleration of fatigue speed and the aggravation of fatigue degree 5 min earlier. Moderate work intensity is a noteworthy work level in extremely cold environment, which is an inflection point in the impact of fatigue and cognitive levels. The manual dexterity significantly increases by the workload intensity, and the high work intensity makes the hands more dexterous (29% increase). Extremely cold environment has a significant effect on short-term memory (decreased 33%). The selective attention was reduced by 16% in the extremely cold environment. With the moderate work intensity in extremely cold environment, the perceived judgment response speed would decrease. The combined effects of the extremely cold environment and the workload on the cognitive functions of psychomotor ability and attention or sensorimotor speed should be paid more attention to.

AB  - This study introduced the block assignment problem in the long-term production planning of a very large real-world shipbuilder and formulated it as a mixed integer linear programming model. For the problem, blocks are assigned to assembly shops for processing; some blocks must be assigned as a group to a region, a collection of assembly shops, because of their mutual dependency. Each assembly shop has its target work level. The objective is to minimize the sum of workload deviations of the assembly shops during a specific planning period. Because the mathematical model could not be solved within a reasonable time, a two-stage matheuristic algorithm was proposed. The algorithm determines the region of blocks in the first stage and the assembly shop for each block in the second stage. Computational experiments were performed using a real-world instance provided by the shipbuilder, including instances of different sizes generated from real-world data. The experiment results demonstrated that the algorithm yielded remarkable reductions of 10.5% and 35.3% in assignment costs and factory workload violations compared with manual planning, respectively. The proposed decomposition-based algorithm also demonstrated superior effectiveness in solving the problem than the full mathematical model. The proposed algorithm is currently embedded in the planning system of the shipbuilder.

AB  - Many organizations use decision support systems (DSS) to support DSS users in their daily work demands (e.g., high workload, insufficient information, ambiguous situations). A key question regarding their interaction is how the decision-control is divided between the DSS and the user, represented by the system's level of automation (LoA). To investigate the need for an adaptable DSS where users can manually adjust the LoA across situations, we used a vignette design to examine whether users prefer different LoA in different situations (i.e., six situational criteria, each manipulated by two specifications; e.g., low vs. high workload). In the twelve vignettes, the 116 participants should imagine working in an emergency control-center—a setting they were familiar with from previous experiments. Our results showed significant differences between the two corresponding vignettes, indicating that users prefer different LoA across situations. However, after controlling for the participants' overall preference for a situation-independent baseline LoA, the significant differences between all paired vignettes disappear. Our results have implications for whether situational or individual criteria are more important regarding LoA preferences, adaptable DSS, and for human-centered design based on user profiles. We discuss our findings in relation to the broader literature on trust and acceptance of DSS.

Thus, the objective of this paper was to provide an overview and investigate differences in physical activities and body postures at work and leisure among blue-collar sectors. The Dphacto cohort consists of 1087 workers from manufacturing, transportation and cleaning sectors (901 blue-collar and 186 white-collar workers) in Denmark. Eligible workers provided physical activity and heart rate measurements over several days with follow-up on health-related outcomes by self-report and registers. Considerable differences in sitting, standing, time on feet (walking, shuffling and standing combined) and forward bending of the back were found between work and leisure, and between the sectors. This overview of physical activity at work and leisure can be useful for better prevention of work-related health issues among blue-collar workers.

AB  - Managing cognitive load depends on adequate resource allocation by the human brain through the engagement of metastable substates, which are large-scale functional networks that change over time. We employed a novel analysis method, deep autoencoder dynamical analysis (DADA), with 100 healthy adults selected from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set in rest and six cognitive tasks. The deep autoencoder of DADA described seven recurrent stochastic metastable substates from the functional connectome of BOLD phase coherence matrices. These substates were significantly differentiated in terms of their probability of appearance, time duration, and spatial attributes. We found that during different cognitive tasks, there was a higher probability of having more connected substates dominated by a high degree of connectivity in the thalamus. In addition, compared with those during tasks, resting brain dynamics have a lower level of predictability, indicating a more uniform distribution of metastability between substates, quantified by higher entropy. These novel findings provide empirical evidence for the philosophically motivated cognitive theory, suggesting on-line and off-line as two fundamentally distinct modes of cognition. On-line cognition refers to task-dependent engagement with the sensory input, while off-line cognition is a slower, environmentally detached mode engaged with decision and planning. Overall, the DADA framework provides a bridge between neuroscience and cognitive theory that can be further explored in the future.

AB  - Human interaction often requires the precise yet flexible interpersonal coordination of rhythmic behavior, as in group music making. The present fMRI study investigates the functional brain networks that may facilitate such behavior by enabling temporal adaptation (error correction), prediction, and the monitoring and integration of information about ‘self’ and the external environment. Participants were required to synchronize finger taps with computer-controlled auditory sequences that were presented either at a globally steady tempo with local adaptations to the participants' tap timing (Virtual Partner task) or with gradual tempo accelerations and decelerations but without adaptation (Tempo Change task). Connectome-based predictive modelling was used to examine patterns of brain functional connectivity related to individual differences in behavioral performance and parameter estimates from the adaptation and anticipation model (ADAM) of sensorimotor synchronization for these two tasks under conditions of varying cognitive load. Results revealed distinct but overlapping brain networks associated with ADAM-derived estimates of temporal adaptation, anticipation, and the integration of self-controlled and externally controlled processes across task conditions. The partial overlap between ADAM networks suggests common hub regions that modulate functional connectivity within and between the brain's resting-state networks and additional sensory-motor regions and subcortical structures in a manner reflecting coordination skill. Such network reconfiguration might facilitate sensorimotor synchronization by enabling shifts in focus on internal and external information, and, in social contexts requiring interpersonal coordination, variations in the degree of simultaneous integration and segregation of these information sources in internal models that support self, other, and joint action planning and prediction.

AB  - The diversification of work as well as the challenges of modern industrial tasks make manual ergonomic assessment tools (i.e., checklist, excel-based worksheet) time consuming and strongly related to the ergonomist’s experience. Recent advancements in wearable sensors technology offer new perspectives in terms of integrating human-monitoring solutions with traditional ergonomics methods by movements’ digitization. Furthermore, digital posture assessment plays a critical role in the context of Industry 5.0, promoting worker well-being and productivity by identifying ergonomic risks and optimizing work environments. Also, leveraging advanced technologies for posture assessment enables proactive intervention strategies to mitigate musculoskeletal disorders and enhance overall workplace safety and efficiency. The present study proposes an innovative hardware and software solution which allows even non-expert designers or ergonomists to carry out a reliable postural ergonomic assessment according to well-known ergonomic methods, speeding up the analysis and providing accurate information. The setup consists of a wearable suit and its proprietary software tool specifically programmed to carry out the ergonomic assessment according to the Time-Based Assessment COmputerized Strategy (TACOs) method. The setup has been preliminarily tested in a controlled environment simulating a real industrial scenario and a comparison with standard ergonomic practices has been performed. The Mann-Whitney U test returned a p-value of [2.198e-11] < α [0.05] demonstrating how the solution proposes results which are numerically and qualitatively enhanced while showing the practical utility of the suggested technical setup and the validity of the suggested digital technique in retrieving and recognizing the workers’ posture.

AB  - The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), as a typical NP-hard optimization problem, has a significant value in manufacturing environment. This paper presents an improved estimation method of Multi-Objective Heuristic Kalman Algorithm (MOHKA) for solving Multi-Objective Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (MOFJSSP). The optimization results of improved MOHKA for the MOFJSSP were implemented in the five Kacem and ten Brendimarte benchmarks. First, an improved mathematical model of MOHKA was proposed and implemented in MATLAB. Then we applied MOHKA to solve MOFJSSP with an improved real number encoding system, optimized for three benchmark optimization parameters, the maximum completion time of on all jobs (makespan), the total workload on all machine, the workload of the critical machine (the maximum workload among the machines). The results presented in the paper show that the improved method of MOHKA for solving MOFJSSP can optimize multi-objective parameters especially for some of these selected cases in which our algorithm gives us high-quality results.

AB  - In modern manufacturing enterprises, quality-related soft sensors are important in production, especially for batch manufacturing processes. In practice, batch processes frequently produce new process modes due to various factors, such as changes in operating recipes, uncertainty in the external environment, and various product specifications. When this is the case, directly applying the historical model may lead to unexpected results. Moreover, it may be impractical to conduct enough trial runs and wait until sufficient batches are available before modeling for the new mode. Therefore, the problem of modeling for a new process mode with insufficient data brings challenges for the soft-sensor issue, which has rarely been addressed before. To solve the problem as mentioned above, a novel transfer and incremental soft-sensor scheme is developed for batch manufacturing processes with the support of multiple historical process modes, termed mode-cloud here. Using the proposed algorithm, the production data from the cloud of historical modes can be explored and utilized regarding their different phase-based relationships between process variables and product qualities. Thus, a new objective function is constructed to automatically identify and quantify the information buried in the vast ocean of historical data to determine the initial soft-sensor model for the new mode with limited data. Besides, with the constant increase of new samples, the initial soft-sensor model can incrementally update model parameters and release the workload of repetitive modeling. With both transfer modeling and incremental updating abilities, the proposed algorithm, which we call mode-cloud based transfer incremental learning (MTIL), can not only offer high adaptability and flexibility to accommodate a new process mode quickly, but also ensure the prediction accuracy. The MTIL based soft-sensor scheme is applied to the real injection molding process for the illustration purpose.

KW  - Segmentation evaluation
AB  - Fully annotated data sets play important roles in medical image segmentation and evaluation. Expense and imprecision are the two main issues in generating ground truth (GT) segmentations. In this paper, in an attempt to overcome these two issues jointly, we propose a method, named SparseGT, which exploit variability among human segmenters to maximally save manual workload in GT generation for evaluating actual segmentations by algorithms. Pseudo ground truth (p-GT) segmentations are created by only a small fraction of workload and with human-level perfection/imperfection, and they can be used in practice as a substitute for fully manual GT in evaluating segmentation algorithms at the same precision. p-GT segmentations are generated by first selecting slices sparsely, where manual contouring is conducted only on these sparse slices, and subsequently filling segmentations on other slices automatically. By creating p-GT with different levels of sparseness, we determine the largest workload reduction achievable for each considered object, where the variability of the generated p-GT is statistically indistinguishable from inter-segmenter differences in full manual GT segmentations for that object. Furthermore, we investigate the segmentation evaluation errors introduced by variability in manual GT by applying p-GT in evaluation of actual segmentations by an algorithm. Experiments are conducted on ∼500 computed tomography (CT) studies involving six objects in two body regions, Head & Neck and Thorax, where optimal sparseness and corresponding evaluation errors are determined for each object and each strategy. Our results indicate that creating p-GT by the concatenated strategy of uniformly selecting sparse slices and filling segmentations via deep-learning (DL) network show highest manual workload reduction by ∼80-96% without sacrificing evaluation accuracy compared to fully manual GT. Nevertheless, other strategies also have obvious contributions in different situations. A non-uniform strategy for slice selection shows its advantage for objects with irregular shape change from slice to slice. An interpolation strategy for filling segmentations can achieve ∼60-90% of workload reduction in simulating human-level GT without the need of an actual training stage and shows potential in enlarging data sets for training p-GT generation networks. We conclude that not only over 90% reduction in workload is feasible without sacrificing evaluation accuracy but also the suitable strategy and the optimal sparseness level achievable for creating p-GT are object- and application-specific.

AB  - For the hydraulic cylinder parts manufacturing shop scheduling problem (HCPMS), which integrates a parallel batch processor hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with the flexible job shop scheduling problem, this paper establishes a multi-objective scheduling model with makespan, total energy consumption, and total machine workload as the optimisation objectives, and proposes an improved multi-objective migrating birds optimisation (IMOMBO) algorithm to solve the problem. First, considering the characteristics of the combination of single-piece and batch processing in the workshop, a double-layer coding rule based on the operation and processing equipment is proposed, and the corresponding decoding rule is designed according to whether the workpiece requires quenching and tempering. Second, a multi-population co-evolution mechanism is developed to enhance the diversity of solutions by conducting different evolutionary strategies. Additionally, six neighborhood structures are introduced to perform local searches for the leader and follower birds, thereby improving the quality of the solutions. Finally, the effectiveness of the IMOMBO algorithm is demonstrated by comparing its results with those of four other algorithms through comparative experiments and a practical case.

AB  - This study focused on increasing productivity and efficiency in a Cancer Clinic (CC) taking into consideration mental workload. The demand of the clinic has increased and the clinic recognized the importance of improving the distribution of the resources. Addressing these objectives have a positive impact in operations, however, it also requires managing the human elements of the system in an efficient way. Previous studies have considered human resources as a number representing a fix quantity of available entities without considering their mental capabilities. This research measured mental workload using a perceptual tool, NASA-TLX, as well as physiological responses. The purpose was to balance patient appointments and increase resource utilization while taking into consideration the balance of human workload as a constraint in the mathematical model. Mental workload was included to assure a balance in the capacity of the human resources without overloading them. The mathematical model was able to successfully build a patient scheduling model considering nurses’ workload. It was shown that the model balanced patient appointments throughout the day by leveling the workload of nurses. Sensitivity analysis showed that the patient demand of the center could be increased by up to 50% without negatively impacting patient service.

AB  - The large scale emergence in the last decade of various cloud solutions, ranging from software-as-a-service (SaaS) based solutions for business process management and implementation to very sophisticated private cloud solutions capable of high performance computing (HPC) and efficient virtualization, constitute the building blocks for engineering the next generation of flexible enterprise systems that can respond with great agility to changes in their environment. These new technologies are adopted at a certain level by manufacturing enterprises in order to advance in a new era of mass customization where flexibility, scalability and agility are the differentiating factors. In this context, this paper introduces the virtualized manufacturing execution system (vMES), an intermediate layer in the manufacturing stack, and discusses the advantages and limitations offered by this approach for manufacturing enterprises. A classification of MES workloads based on the ISA-95 function model is presented, focusing on the virtualization techniques suitable for each workload, considering the algorithms and technologies used and the virtualization overhead. A pilot vMES implementation using a parallel process for smart resource provisioning and automatic scaling is also presented. The pilot implementation using six Adept robots and one IBM CloudBurst 2.1 private cloud and an ISA-95 based MES is described; the virtualization sequence is analyzed in several scenarios of resource workload collocation on physical cloud blades with and without perturbations.

AB  - Parallel DBMSs have become more and more mature and getting several success stories in the industry. This situation has been reached by powerful data partitioning and data allocation techniques and algorithms. By analyzing these findings closely, we figure out that they are quickly stressed by the workload changes, which represents the usual case of business analytics applications. To deal with this challenge in the context of big data warehouses, several studies proposed to move to another processing paradigm outside the DBMS realm such as Spark by proposing adaptive partitioning solutions to tackle the workload changes. The majority of approaches are offline and those that are online cause significant random disk I/O costs. This is because the correlation that may exist between jobs and data blocks read from the disk is not captured to refine the adaptive partitioning algorithms. This represents one of the major causes of providing high performance of dynamic workloads. To solve such limitations, we propose in this paper a proactive framework for query-aware adaptive partitioning (called PROADAPT) that uses an AI-inspired methodology that can be connected to any query optimizer managing partitioned data. This methodology uses a genetic algorithm to solve our formalized problem that considers the interaction that may exist among workload queries. PROADAPT intensively rewrites queries by exploiting dimension hierarchies to skip irrelevant data and then improves I/O performance. Different technical modules of our framework are discussed. Finally, we conduct intensive experiments on Postgres-XL and a Spark SQL parallel cluster to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

The method can be used to monitor and solve wind power generation problems at the same time. It also provides several advantages with respect to other traditional methods which imply significant workload and maintenance personnel. The functional requirements of the intelligent control system are analyzed, and a control algorithm for the stepping motor is selected and evaluated. Through the comparative analysis of the active power and internal temperature curve for three kinds of output power of the prototype, it is proved that the environmental intelligent control system greatly improves the operation efficiency, solves typical problems in the ventilator room environment, and provides a solid theoretical basis for further research in this field.

AB  - To attain improved human-machine collaboration, it is necessary for autonomous systems to infer human trust and workload and respond accordingly. In turn, autonomous systems require models that capture both human trust and workload dynamics. In a companion paper, we developed a trust-workload partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model framework that captured changes in human trust and workload for contexts that involve interaction between a human and an intelligent decision-aid system. In this paper, we define intuitive reward functions and show that these can be readily transformed for integration with the proposed POMDP model. We synthesize a near-optimal control policy using transparency as the feedback variable based on solutions for two cases: 1) increasing human trust and reducing workload, and 2) improving overall performance along with the aforementioned objectives for trust and workload. We implement these solutions in a reconnaissance mission study in which human subjects are aided by a virtual robotic assistant in completing a series of missions. We show that it is not always beneficial to aim to improve trust; instead, the control objective should be to optimize a context-specific performance objective when designing intelligent decision-aid systems that influence trust-workload behavior.

AB  - Converging electrophysiological evidence suggests that the alpha rhythm plays an important and active role in cognitive processing. Here, we systematically studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under three experimental conditions — rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8Hz. We also measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest, found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a wider frequency range than the 8–12Hz band many studies tend to include in their analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results against certain subjects and conditions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to quantify performance in human-robot interaction under time-delay conditions in a lunar tele-operations sampling task, by testing the hypothesis that an increase of time-delay would lead to higher perceived workload and lower human performance in human-robotic integrated operations. Tele-operation is key in the exploration of the Moon, and allows for robotic elements to be controlled from orbital infrastructure and other planetary bodies such as the Earth. Considering that future missions aim to control rovers (amongst others for sampling tasks) from Earth (delay: 3s), the Gateway (delay: 0.5s) and the Moon (delay: 0s), control under the time-delay conditions for these locations must be studied. Time-delay can affect performance, and understanding the performance means that mission operations can be planned bottom-up, which benefits both the preparation of the crew and the design of rovers. An experiment was conducted with 18 engineers who were assigned to control a robotic arm under three time-delay conditions, representing the three control locations. Several metrics were derived from cardiac, ocular, subjective and behavioral measures. The analyses disclosed that the large time-delay condition statistically increased the perceived workload, the time to complete the mission and decreased heart rate variability compared to the other conditions. However, no effect of time-delay was found on attentional and executive abilities. The metrics proved to be effective in the study of performance quantification in human-robot interaction for tele-operations in lunar control scenarios. This approach can be implemented for a larger range of robotic activities, such as tele-operated driving.

In this article, we propose a virtual reality (VR) based robot teleoperation system to achieve more efficient and natural interaction with humans in different scenes. A user-friendly VR interface is designed to help users interact with a desktop scene using their hands efficiently and intuitively. To improve user experience and reduce workload, we simulate the process in the physics engine to help build a preview of the scene after manipulation in the virtual scene before execution. W e conduct experiments with different users and compare our system with a direct control method across several teleoperation tasks. The user study demonstrates that the proposed system enables users to perform operations more instinctively with a lighter mental workload. Users can perform pick-and-place and object-stacking tasks in a considerably short time, even for beginners. Our code is available at https://github.com/lingxiaomeng/VR_Teleoperation_Gen3.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for characterizing errors associated with different categories of human observation combined with a method for integrating these into a hard+soft data fusion system. Error characteristics of human observers (often referred to as soft data sensors) have typically been artificially generated and lack contextual considerations that in a real-world application can drastically change the accuracy and precision of these characteristics. The proposed framework and method relies on error values that change based upon known and unknown states of qualifying variables empirically shown to affect observation accuracy under different contexts. This approach allows fusion systems to perform uncertainty alignment on data coming from human observers. The preprocessed data yields a more complete and reliable situation assessment when it is processed by data association and stochastic graph matching algorithms. This paper also provides an approach and results of initial validation testing of the proposed methodology. The testing approach leverages error characterization models for several exemplar categories of observation in combination with simulated synthetic data. Results have shown significant performance improvements with respect to both data association and situation assessment fusion processes with an average F-measure improvement of 0.16 and 0.20 for data association and situation assessment respectively. These F-measure improvements are representative of fewer incorrect and missed associations and fewer graph matching results, which then must be considered by human analysts. These benefits are expected to translate into a reduction of the overall cognitive workload facing human analysts in situations where they are tasked with developing and maintaining situational awareness.

AB  - Humans often rely on feedback to learn. Indeed, in learning the difference between feedback and an expected outcome is computed to inform future actions. Further, recent work has found that reward and feedback have a unique role in modulating conflict processing and cognitive control. However, it is still not clear how conflict, especially concerning the processing and evaluation of feedback, impacts learning. To address this, we examined the effects of feedback competition on feedback evaluation in a reinforcement learning task. Specifically, we had participants play a simple two-choice gambling game while electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. On half of the experiment blocks, we reversed the meaning of performance feedback for each trial from its prepotent meaning to induce response conflict akin to the Stroop effect (e.g., ‘✓’ meant incorrect). Behaviourally, we found that participants’ accuracy was reduced as a result of incongruent feedback. Paralleling this, an analysis of our EEG revealed that incongruent feedback resulted in a reduction in amplitude of the reward positivity and the P300, components of the human event-related brain potential implicated in reward processing. Our results demonstrate the negative impact of conflict on feedback evaluation and the impact of this on subsequent performance.

AB  - One of the key questions in the study of human language acquisition is the extent to which the development of neural processing networks for different components of language are modulated by exposure to linguistic stimuli. Sign languages offer a unique perspective on this issue, because prelingually Deaf children who receive access to complex linguistic input later in life provide a window into brain maturation in the absence of language, and subsequent neuroplasticity of neurolinguistic networks during late language learning. While the duration of sensitive periods of acquisition of linguistic subsystems (sound, vocabulary, and syntactic structure) is well established on the basis of L2 acquisition in spoken language, for sign languages, the relative timelines for development of neural processing networks for linguistic sub-domains are unknown. We examined neural responses of a group of Deaf signers who received access to signed input at varying ages to three linguistic phenomena at the levels of classifier signs, syntactic structure, and information structure. The amplitude of the N400 response to the marked word order condition negatively correlated with the age of acquisition for syntax and information structure, indicating increased cognitive load in these conditions. Additionally, the combination of behavioral and neural data suggested that late learners preferentially relied on classifiers over word order for meaning extraction. This suggests that late acquisition of sign language significantly increases cognitive load during analysis of syntax and information structure, but not word-level meaning.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) is considered an emerging Industry 4.0 technology with the potential to significantly change operations and supply chain management. In this context, this study aims to explore the effects of AM adoption on how companies conduct business. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review including 136 papers was conducted. As a result, a framework including all of the effects (consolidated and inconclusive) found of AM adoption on a company's business was developed. While various effects (e.g., the feasibility of a complex product, the freedom of product design, mass customization capability, and product variety) have frequently been studied in the literature and are consolidated, some are still considered consolidated effects but presenting only conceptual studies (e.g., enterprise reliability, equipment reliability/availability for maintenance, information flow, and production democratization) then needed practical research. In addition, there are still contradictions regarding the effects of AM on competitiveness, cost, dependence on the supplier, environmental impact, health and safety, product quality, production efficiency, responsiveness, supply chain complexity and flexibility, worker qualifications, number of workers and workload (inconclusive effects). In the end, this paper identifies management and technical/technological aspects to be considered when adopting AM, which have positive or negative effects on the AM adoption process. The most important aspects include technology, production strategy, technical requirements and supply chain distribution, influencing AM adoption positively or negatively. Then, we also highlight some inconclusive research results from the literature, presenting opportunities for future research. This work may support managers and policy makers in better understanding the AM adoption process and their potential business impacts.

AB  - Virtualization of manufacturing execution system (vMES) workloads offers a set of design and operational advantages to enterprises, the most visible being improved resource utilization and flexibility of the overall solution. This paper explores redundancy and scalability, as other important operational advantages introduced by the use of private clouds for MES virtualization in the context of the programmable infrastructure (PI) concept. PI is a new architectural approach in which the computing infrastructure, represented by resources, networks, storage, becomes dynamic and is controlled by the application, in contrast with traditional architectures where the application has to adapt to a static infrastructure. For MES applications, the adoption of PI has the potential to add a new layer of flexibility and optimization by allowing quick configuration and re-configuration based on environmental changes, especially in the context of virtualization in private cloud where workloads can be provisioned and de-provisioned in real time. In this context, this paper presents the main redundancy and scalability requirements for the workloads identified in ISA-95.03 based solutions and discusses in detail the strategies to assure the redundancy and scalability requirements of these workloads both individually and at the system level. The main contributions of this paper are therefore the introduction of PI combined with private cloud virtualization at the MES layer in order to achieve redundancy and scalability of the control solution. The pilot implementation presented is based on PI concepts and is realized in practice using SOA BPEL and IBM CloudBurst REST APIs. The MES system considered for the pilot implementation adopts a multi-agent vMES architecture having COBASA-type functionality. The experimental results presented in this paper show the system response in a set of failure scenarios, with focus on the reconfiguration time of workloads, and the dynamic response to perturbations in the system.

AB  - Seru production can reduce makespan, labor hours and manpower by improving workers’ workload balance based on the reconfiguration of workers. Therefore, this study focuses on the fundamental principles of seru system balancing. For a seru, we define and formulate seru balance (SB) to describe workloads balance of the workers in the seru. For a seru system containing more serus, the seru system balance (SSB) needs to be evaluated from workloads balance of all workers and workloads balance among all serus. Consequently, we define and formulate intra-seru system balancing (Intra-SSB) and inter-seru system balancing (Inter-SSB) to evaluate the two perspectives respectively. We theoretically develop the lower and upper bounds of Intra-SSB and Inter-SSB respectively. In addition, we define and formulate the seru system balancing problem (SSBP) as a bi-objective model with maximizing Intra-SSB and Inter-SSB simultaneously. The property of solution space for SSBP is analyzed. Finally, we develop an improved algorithm based on ε-constraint for SSBP. The algorithm saves computation time by cutting non-Pareto-optimal solutions before performing ε-constraint.

AB  - Autonomous driving has the potential to be the next critical technology that changes the lifestyle of a human. It has, however, not been verified whether the autonomous technology at different lower levels decreases or increases the mental workload of drivers. This paper verifies the relationship between a driver’s mental workload and level 0, 1 and 2 of autonomous driving using NASA-TLX and adjusted response time in a secondary task simulation study. Experiment results show that level 1 causes the lowest mental workload of the driver, followed by level 2 and level 0. We discuss this nonlinear relationship between the levels of autonomous driving support and the mental workloads incurred to the human driver.

AB  - Twelve Royal Marines participated in a laboratory study of a passive lower limb exoskeleton. Participants stood for 5 min in a semi-squatting posture in the laboratory while performing the Sustained Attention to Response Test (SART), repeated on separate days while wearing and without the exoskeleton. Performance on the SART was degraded when the semi-squatting posture was adopted and did not recover after 15 min of rest. The SART was rated as less frustrating when the exoskeleton was worn, while less time pressure and task conflict were reported and the need to exert self-control to maintain the posture was rated lower. There was no effect of the exoskeleton on SART performance. However, subjects’ increase in heart rate when squatting, without the exoskeleton, was positively correlated with an increase in their SART error rate. The findings are discussed in relation to the cognitive demands of performing physically demanding tasks and the possibility that new technologies designed to enhance human physical ability may also improve cognitive capacity.

AB  - Force output and muscle activity represent the gold standards for measuring physical fatigue. This study explores using ocular metrics for tracking changes in physical fatigue during the completion of a repeated handle push/pull task. Participants completed this task over three trials, and pupil size was recorded by means of a head-mounted eye-tracker. Blink frequency was also measured. Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection.

AB  - Driving behaviour is an inherently complex process affected by various factors ranging from network topography, traffic conditions and vehicle features to driver characteristics like age, experience, aggressiveness and emotional state. Among these, the effects of emotional state and stress have received considerable attention in the context of crash analysis and safety research where driving behaviour has been found to be affected by drivers’ mental state/stress, cognitive workload and distraction. However, these studies are mostly based on questionnaire surveys and self-reports which can be prone to response bias and reporting/measurement errors. The analyses are also often descriptive in nature. In a parallel stream of research, advances in sensor technologies have made it possible to observe drivers’ stress through human physiological responses, e.g. heart rate, electro-dermal activity etc. However, these studies have primarily focused on detecting stress rather than quantifying or modelling its effects on driving decisions. The present paper combines these two approaches in a single framework and investigates the gap-acceptance behaviour of drivers during an intersection crossing, using data collected using a driving simulator. The participants are deliberately subjected to stress induced by time pressure, and their stress levels are measured using two physiological indicators, namely Electrodermal Activity (skin conductance) and heart rate. In addition to statistical analyses, discrete choice models are developed to link the accept-reject choices of a driver with the driver demographics, traffic conditions and stress levels. The results of the models indicate that increased stress levels significantly increase the probabilities of accepting a gap. The improvement in model fit and safety implications derived from model estimates are also discussed. The insights from the results can be used for designing appropriate intervention strategies to improve safety.

AB  - In order to optimize production processes and to avoid errors, it is not only necessary to automate processes, but also to integrate workers wit their individual personality and skill profiles. For this purpose, human factors should be considered in the entire design process. The integrate view of mental human models, the cognitive demand of the working environment and the automation design is essential. Human-Syste Integration (HSI) constitutes a promising approach. Current model-based approaches offer possibilities to analyze and optimize tasks within a overall system, but they still lack integration. This leads to the research question: How can human factors be integrated into a system model of socio-technical, Cyber-Physical Production System? The paper at hand contributes an approach of human factor integration into the procedu of Model-Based Systems Engineering for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). The approach combines a system model of a CPPS wi HSI concepts. In accordance to the benefits of MBSE, SysML is selected to integrate human factors in the development process of a CPPS. Th approach is divided into five steps, which include the extension of the SysML meta model. This allows the optimization of skill-based huma machine interaction. Defined HSI-Profiles enable system developers to integrate employee requirements at early stages within the developme process. The approach is demonstrated by the maintenance of a 3D-Printer as a case example. This research enables system developers to depi individual workers with the help of the developed concepts and systematically integrate them into the development process of a CPPS.

Data were collected from forty-eight adults across varied office task scenarios (i.e., sending an email, setting up a timer/reminder, and searching for a phone number/address) and noise types (i.e., silence, non-verbal noise, and verbal noise). The baseline for this study is measured without the use of an IVA. Significant differences in performance and workload were found on both objective and subjective measures. In particular, verbal noise emerged as the primary factor affecting performance using an IVA. Task performance was dependent on the task scenario and noise type. Subjective ratings found that participants preferred to use IVA for less complex tasks. Future work can focus more on the effects of tasks, demographics, and learning curves. Furthermore, this work can help guide IVA system designers by highlighting factors affecting performance.

AB  - A teleoperation system for maintenance robots using an Augmented Reality (AR) environment as a human-robot interface is proposed. The components at the remote maintenance site are reproduced in the local environment of the operator using a mixture of physical and virtual objects. The AR environment enhances situational awareness and reduces cognitive load by immersing the operator in a representation of the remote site and overlaying information related to the maintenance task on the corresponding objects. Another contribution of the proposed system is an intuitive method for defining ad-hoc robotic maintenance tasks without the need for robot programming knowledge.

AB  - We investigated the preparation of a spoken answer response to interrogative sentences by measuring response time (RT) and the response-related readiness potential (RP). By comparing the RT and RP results we aimed to identify whether the RP-onset is more related to the actual speech preparation process or the pure intention to speak after turn-anticipation. Additionally, we investigated if the RP-onset can be influenced by the syntactic structure (one or two completion points). Therefore, the EEG data were sorted based on two variables: the cognitive load required for the response and the syntactic structure of the stimulus questions. The results of the response utterance preparation associated event-related potential (ERP) and the RT suggest that the RP-onset is more related to the actual speech preparation process rather than the pure intention to speak after turn-anticipation. However, the RP-onset can be influenced by the syntactic structure of the question leading to an early response preparation.

AB  - A long prevailing view of human reasoning suggests severe limits on our ability to adhere to simple logical or mathematical prescriptions. A key position assumes these failures arise from insufficient monitoring of rapidly produced intuitions. These faulty intuitions are thought to arise from a proposed substitution process, by which reasoners unknowingly interpret more difficult questions as easier ones. Recent work, however, suggests that reasoners are not blind to this substitution process, but in fact detect that their erroneous responses are not warranted. Using the popular bat-and-ball problem, we investigated whether this substitution sensitivity arises out of an automatic System 1 process or whether it depends on the operation of an executive resource demanding System 2 process. Results showed that accuracy on the bat-and-ball problem clearly declined under cognitive load. However, both reduced response confidence and increased response latencies indicated that biased reasoners remained sensitive to their faulty responses under load. Results suggest that a crucial substitution monitoring process is not only successfully engaged, but that it automatically operates as an autonomous System 1 process. By signaling its doubt along with a biased intuition, it appears System 1 is “smarter” than traditionally assumed.

AB  - Increased automation has shifted the operator control paradigm from a single operator controlling a single vehicle, to multiple operators collaborating to control multiple vehicles; this paradigm is known as m:N. Many questions remain unanswered in this new operational paradigm about the division of assets as workload for individual operators varies over time. This paper explores the management of workload by enabling operators to temporarily handoff vehicles among each other. A study was conducted to explore both a manual and assisted method for performing handoffs during manipulated contingency scenarios. The assisted handoff method allowed subjects to easily choose and group nominal and/or contingency vehicles. The number of contingencies was also manipulated to determine the effect workload had on how pilots utilized the ability to handoff vehicles. Results show subjects performed handoffs more often when there were more contingencies and when the assisted handoff tool was available. In addition, the assisted tool made subjects feel more comfortable, enabling them to feel like they could take longer to resolve contingency situations. Lastly, even during contingencies, subjects were able to successfully complete secondary tasks.

AB  - Many human activities require high cognitive performance over long periods, while impairments induced by sleep deprivation influence various aspects of cognitive abilities, including working memory (WM), attention, and processing speed. Based on previous research, vagal nerve stimulation can modulate cognitive abilities, attention, and arousal. Two experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) to relieve the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation. In the first experiment, 35 participants completed N-back tasks at 8:00 a.m. for two consecutive days in a within-subject study. Then, the participants received either taVNS or earlobe stimulation (active control) intervention in two sessions at random orders after 24 h of sustained wakefulness. Then, they completed the N-back tasks again. In the second experiment, 30 participants completed the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and 32 completed the N-back tasks at 8:00 a.m. on the first and second days. Then, they received either taVNS or earlobe stimulation at random orders and finished the N-back and PVT tasks immediately after one hour. In Experiment 1, taVNS could significantly improve the accuracy rate of participants in spatial 3-back tasks compared to active control, which was consistent with experiment 2. However, taVNS did not specifically enhance PVT performance. Therefore, taVNS could be a powerful intervention for acute sleep deprivation as it can improve performance on high cognitive load tasks and is easy to administer.

AB  - Workload pattern detection can be used as part of a proactive decision-making approach to optimize resource provisioning strategies and anticipate any performance problem in cloud computing environments. Existing workload pattern detection approaches suffer from two essential limitations which restrict their effectiveness in such environments. Specifically, they require massive human intervention, and are specific to particular types of workload data. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a generic workload pattern and periodicity detection technique that employs the prefix transposition approach from the molecular biology domain to detect workload periodicity in node-specific and aggregated cloud environments. The strengths of the proposed technique compared to the state of the art lie in its ability to be applied to any type of workload, and also to detect patterns of varying lengths, amplitudes, and shapes. Experiments conducted on cloud server nodes and aggregated CPU and throughput workload datasets collected from Information Technology (IT) and Telecom domains reveal that our solution improves the accuracy of the detections, especially in harsh environments, where the lengths, shapes, and amplitudes of patterns vary, as compared to the autocorrelation technique. Other findings show that the proposed approach is also highly efficient at detecting multiple short-term and long-term periodic patterns on any type of time series-based cloud computing workloads of different time granularity.

AB  - The SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite has received wide attention in both academia and industry. However, few work have studied the memory behaviors in SPEC CPU2017 workloads from a time dependence perspective. We run all SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks and collect 43 memory traces. This paper examines the correlation of memory access intervals in all SPEC CPU2017 workloads. The results show that there is a certain degree of correlation in the majority of the SPEC CPU2017 applications (79%). This observation differs from the SPEC CPU2006 in which the correlation of access behavior only exists in a small number of applications (27%). This phenomenon may be associated with an order-of-magnitude increase in the average instruction count in SPEC CPU2017. For each of 34 SPEC CPU2017 workloads with a certain degree of correlation, this paper estimates the Hurst parameters to test the self-similar property statistically. All Hurst parameters estimated are greater than 0.5, confirming the existence of self-similarity in SPEC CPU2017 workloads. We further deploy a versatile memory trace generator based on the inputs measured from the collected SPEC CPU2017 trace data. Experimental results show that the proposed model is robust for the memory access synthesis of various SPEC CPU2017 applications, and can accurately characterize the burstiness of memory access behaviors in SPEC CPU2017 workloads and more faithful than conventional models.

AB  - GPGPUs are used to run a wide range of applications due to their high performance. As technology scales down, processing units become more susceptible to different types of faults due to radiations, manufacturing defects, wearout and aging. Some faults are detected and fixed before deployment, while others appear during infield operation. To address infield faults, continuous and periodic testing mechanisms are leveraged. In this paper, we propose a GPGPU-specific technique that takes advantage of a couple of GPGPU workloads characteristics to reduce the performance overhead of periodic testing. First, we show that many GPGPU workloads experience high probability of input similarity between threads of the same warp. Second, we show that GPGPU workloads have noticeable variation in the threads activity of their warps. Traditional periodic testing mechanisms, when applied to GPGPUs, fail to exploit these observations. Hence, we propose the half-SP deactivation technique to exploit these workload characteristics and reduce the performance overhead of the periodic testing in GPGPU platforms. The results show that the proposed technique can reduce the performance overhead of the testing from 29% to 8% with less than 1.8% area and power overheads.

AB  - In the realm of customized manufacturing, production cycles are often compressed to capture market opportunities swiftly. The blanking system stands as the inaugural and pivotal phase in the realm of large equipment customized manufacturing. This study abstracts a novel problem from real-world blanking systems, as the distributed unrelated parallel machine scheduling with heterogeneous factories and order priorities (DUPMS-HP). The presented work formulates the bi-objective DUPMS-HP, aiming to minimize both the total weighted tardiness and the workload gap of each machine. A learning-based two-phase cooperative optimizer (LCTPO) is introduced to address this NP-hard problem, featuring: i) a cooperative evolutionary algorithm during the first stage for global search to ensure diversity; ii) the incorporation of five problem-specific local search strategies in the first stage to balance priority and due date constraints. Additionally, reinforcement learning is applied to learn and select the best neighborhood search operator for each elite solution, further enhancing diversity. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through a comparative analysis with five state-of-the-art algorithms on 20 instances. Experimental results affirm that LCTPO is more adept at solving DUPMS-HP compared to the alternative algorithms.

AB  - Timely evaluating operator Mental Workload (MW) levels in human–computer interaction helps to assign tasks legitimately and guarantee safety and efficiency at the same time. This study presented a stable Electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern over time. A data augmentation (DA) method and a deep neural network (NN) are developed accordingly based on the peculiarity of the EEG pattern for MW assessment. The EEG pattern consists of rhythmic energies in the Temporal–Spatial–Spectral domain, named energy tensor. The DA method for energy tensors is realized by randomly disrupting the temporal dimension which was certified to be irrelevant to MW levels in our previous study. The NN is designed based on deep transfer learning and Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (DS-CNN). Energy tensors after DA are used as the input of the proposed NN to construct MW classifiers and the entire operation is named transfer DS-CNN framework. The experiment results demonstrate that the optimal temporal resolution of EEG patterns for MW classification is 3.5 min. The transfer DS-CNN framework is effective enough to build a cross-session MW classifier for a specific subject in an average of 9.195 s, with an average prediction accuracy of 97.22%. Our study suggests that the stable EEG patterns and the DA method preserve features for cross-session MW recognition. It is befitting to discriminate MW levels in real-time with the transfer DS-CNN framework.

AB  - Machine utilization is an important factor for the productivity of manufacturing systems. On the one hand, under-utilization would cause low productivity; on the other hand, according to the reliability theory, over-utilization would increase the failure rates of machines and consequently also decrease their utilization rates. In this paper, we present a problem of distributing a predefined workload to a set of available machines under reliability-centered maintenance, the aim of which is to optimize the overall machine utilization in terms of minimizing the total cost caused by maintenance and work delay. We consider two versions of the problem, one with homogeneous machines and the other with heterogeneous machines, both of which are formulated as integer programs. We adapt a set of well-known metaheuristics, including genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and water wave optimization (WWO), to solve this problem. Computational experiments on a variety of problem instances from real-world manufacturers show that the adapted WWO algorithm exhibits the best performance on both versions.

AB  - Job performance is crucial to success in the labor-intensive and competitive construction industry. Unlike previous studies, this research focused not only on the overall job satisfaction and job performance relationship but also provided enhanced insights into the relationship between employee satisfaction levels with different aspects of their jobs and the individual impacts of each of these on the employee’s overall job performance in a comprehensive manner by presenting the survey findings of 394 skilled laborers, engineers/architects, and managerial staff in the Turkish and North Cyprus construction markets. A further contribution of the current study is differentiating among various categories of construction professionals for potential approach variations in the analysis of the defined relationship. Both job satisfaction and job performance vary considerably based on different employee categories. The lowest job satisfaction and job performance were recorded by skilled laborers, while the greatest ones were recorded by engineers/architects, and there was a strong positive correlation between job satisfaction and performance across all respondent categories. Regression analysis findings revealed “workload conditions” as the only strong predictor of job performance existing in all three categories, indicating a need to reconsider the heavy workload tradition available in the construction industry. The distinct difference between the job satisfaction facets that predicted job performance in various employee categories was a noteworthy finding. This suggests that organizations may benefit from categorizing their employee groups, concentrating on each group’s distinct approach, and developing tailored strategies in response. Strikingly, numerous strong predictors of job performance identified in this research may be improved without significant investment, giving the organizations a competitive edge. This study provides a guide for construction organizations in identifying the key job satisfaction facets to prioritize while implementing tailored strategies to improve the job performance of three types of crucial construction professionals.

AB  - Learning factories play an important role when studying multi-disciplinary problems. Such a problem is to support operators in multi-variant assembly. Multi-variants cause problems with product quality, production time as well as cognitive load and therefore it is important to find ways to support operators in this context. To assess the effects of multi variants, a design concept were developed in a learning factory environment (SIILab, CPPS-testbed). The concept was constructed at a conveyer belt with three assembly stations using Casat software for instruction presentations. The following aspects were included in the human-centered learning factory: studying the introduction of advanced automation, managing product variety, supporting operators in finding information and supporting existing human-automation interactions.

AB  - Inspection in Aerospace industry can, as well as many other industrial applications, benefit from using Augmented Reality (AR) due to its ability to superimpose helpful digital information in 3D, leading to fewer errors and decreased mental demand. However, each AR device has advantages and disadvantages, and not all AR devices are suitable for use in industrial settings. We compare a tripod-fitted-adjustable-arm tablet-based AR solution (Apple iPad Pro) to head-mounted AR (Microsoft HoloLens 2) and a traditional, computer screen-based human-machine interface (HMI), all three designed to guide operators based on previously performed AI-based image analysis. Following an iterative design process with three formative evaluations, a final field test in a real industrial shop floor engaging 6 professional inspectors revealed an overall preference for the tripod-fitted iPad variant which receiving the best scores in most dimensions covered in both a usability-focused SUS questionnaire (score 71) and a NASA-RTLX form focused on perceived workload. More specifically, the tripod-fitted iPad was considered more usable (SUS) than the classic computer display HMI (M=5.83, SD=4.92, p=0.034, N=6); the temporal demand (NASA-RTLX) was considered lower using the iPad compared to both HoloLens 2 and the HMI (M=6.67, SD=4.08, p=0.010; M=10.83, SD=9.70, p=0.040, N=6), respectively.

AB  - Precise programming of robots for industrial tasks is inflexible to variations and time-consuming. Teaching a kinematic behavior by demonstration and encoding it with dynamical systems that are robust with respect to perturbations, is proposed in order to address this issue. Given a kinematic behavior encoded by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), this work proposes a passive control scheme for assisting kinesthetic modifications of the learned behavior in task variations. It employs the utilization of penetrable spherical Virtual Fixtures (VFs) around the DMP’s virtual evolution that follows the teacher’s motion. The controller enables the user to haptically ‘inspect’ the spatial properties of the learned behavior in SE(3) and significantly modify it at any required segment, while facilitating the following of already learned segments. A demonstration within the VFs could signify that the kinematic behavior is taught correctly and could lead to autonomous execution, with the DMP generating the newly learned reference commands. The proposed control scheme is theoretically proved to be passive and experimentally validated with a KUKA LWR4+ robot. Results are compared with the case of using a gravity compensated robot agnostic of the previously learned task. It is shown that the time duration of teaching and the user’s cognitive load are reduced.

AB  - A comprehensive multiobjective model of the cellular manufacturing system (CMS) operating in a dynamic environment is developed. The proposed algorithm takes into consideration various important cell design issues, such as machine assignment, intercell/intracell material handling, worker assignment, outsourcing and workload balancing based on operational time and operation sequence of the parts. Workload balancing among cells tends to increase CMS processing costs, and hence the use of multiobjective optimization methods is required for CMS solutions that are optimal and feasible. A multiobjective matrix-based bacteria foraging optimization algorithm with traced constraint handling (MOMBATCH) is developed for this purpose. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II method that is frequently reported in the literature and the off-the-shelf program CPLEX. The results show that MOMBATCH solves problems more efficiently in terms of finding optimal solutions while maintaining the Pareto frontier diversity.

AB  - Relevant riding information such as speed or navigation instructions are typically displayed in head down dashboards on Powered Two-Wheelers. Data glasses provide information directly in the field of view and could, therefore, reduce glances away from the roadway ahead to focus on the dashboard. This study aimed to examine whether providing information in data glasses while riding as compared to classical head down displays makes a difference. Therefore, a total of N = 24 riders completed the ISO lane change test on a motorcycle riding simulator. Meanwhile, riders had to react to changing turn-by-turn indications which were either displayed in the dashboard, in the data glasses or redundantly in both display technologies. The performance in the lane change test and the reaction times achieved in the secondary task were examined along with riders’ workload by means of the Detection Response Task (DRT) and questionnaire data. Results revealed that riders’ lane change performances did not differ between the conditions ‘data glasses’ and ‘dashboard’. Information displayed in the data glasses was recognized faster and fewer turn-by-turn indications were missed. The performance in the DRT remained unchanged throughout the test conditions, while the subjective workload experience decreased with the use of data glasses. Overall, the results suggest that data glasses did not provoke an attentional capture effect and were, therefore, not inferior compared to dashboards regarding riding performance. However, data glasses did reduce the perceived workload and may in particular provide a safety benefit when time-critical information, such as warnings, need to be displayed.

AB  - The paper presents repeatable effects of synchronizing visual and auditory alarms with heartbeats on the availability of cognitive resources. A perception-driven situation awareness model is proposed and studied by implementing two distinct experimental protocols with different groups of participants. Results of a first study with a single-screen configuration are repeated by those of a second one on a multiple-screen context. Both experimental protocols rely on manipulating a between-subjects factor to compare two conditions - one with alarms activated synchronously with heart rate and one with alarms non-synchronized with heart rate - and a within-subjects factor to compare the impact of workload by increasing the level of task difficulty. Results about mono-screen and multi-screen configurations are homogenous. The synchronous condition makes people produce significantly more errors and fewer visual scans of the alarm display area. This degradation of perceptual abilities is non-conscious and is correlated with workload. Main people are not aware about their actual performance and this is confirmed by the evolution of subjective performance and frustration regarding task difficulty, display configuration and alarm activation condition. Such discrepancies between what it is looked at with what it is actually perceived and between actual and perceived indicators like performance are perceptual dissonances that are relevant for perception-driven situation awareness. The application of synchronizing dynamic events with heartbeats will be studied for different individual and collective work contexts in order to extend the proposed perception-driven situation awareness model based on perceptual dissonance management and on human capability parameters.

AB  - In make-to-order manufacturing systems, the production plan is made according to randomly fluctuating customer orders, therefore, the workload distributed to production machines fluctuates with customer orders. The workload that a production machine undertakes influences its deterioration process and maintenance. Besides, different types of dependencies among production machines also influence the production and maintenance scheduling of manufacturing systems. Existing studies have not paid enough attention to the joint optimization of production and maintenance for make-to-order manufacturing systems considering different types of dependencies. In this paper, first, customer orders are predicted using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) according to their characteristics. Second, the model of daily working hours is proposed to represent the influence of customer orders on the deterioration process of production machines. Third, the reliability and imperfect maintenance models of production machines considering three types of dependencies are proposed, and the optimal maintenance time window (MTW) for opportunistic maintenance is obtained in order to minimize the maintenance cost. Fourth, the mathematical model of the entire cost of a new production line construction, covering maintenance cost, operators’ salary, and construction cost, is proposed, and the optimal construction time is obtained in order to minimize the entire cost. Finally, a real use case of the manufacturing system for the shell of air-conditioning compressor is given to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed model and method. The originality of this work lies in the consideration of the influence of customer orders on the deterioration process of production machines and the modelling of different types of dependencies among production machines in a single model.

AB  - Every year, companies spend millions of euros for Work related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). In order to reduce this cost and pain at work, they started to integrate Physical Assistance Device (PAD) such as exoskeletons. These new products aim to provide physical assistance to the operator but their integration is facing many barriers such as morphological adaptability, bad usability and a negative perception among workers. Exoskeletons are bringing a new type of interaction with human that is crucial to understand. This paper addresses the emerging issue of the impact of PAD on the hardness of manufacturing working tasks and on the usability satisfaction of workers. The use case focuses on a sanding operation on a catamaran hull, with an upper body passive exoskeleton provided by our partner Skel-ex. Experimental measurements such as cardiac cost, posture analysis and usability tests are carried out on a set of participants during finishing tasks. In order to better understand how exoskeletons support able-bodied people at work and reduce fatigue, we present results that show a positive impact of the assistance on physical workload.

AB  - Increasing number of people work long hours with computers under high cognitive load. This could potentially cause mental stress in workplaces. Prolonged exposure to mental stress contributes to poor working experience and even severe health problems. Despite the growing demand, the existing intelligent stress detection methods are limited when applied to actual workplaces. They often measure physiological and physical signals, via intrusive devices, to detect stress. The intrusiveness hampers their accessibility and applicability in daily life and workplaces. To overcome that, behavior-based methods were proposed. Models that explore mouse and gaze behaviors during computer usages were demonstrated to be particularly effective. However, the current methods rely on using prior knowledge of the user interface (UI) layout to construct models. Their applicability thus is limited, especially in real workplaces where task UI is often dynamic. This paper presents a novel stress detection method to address the challenges. It attains non-intrusiveness and UI-agnostic by modeling the relative movement and coordination of mouse and gaze. The method is evaluated on a dynamic-UI task, namely, web searching. An accuracy of 78.8% is achieved using a commercial eye-tracker for gaze estimation, beating the state-of-the-art approaches by around 20%. We further use webcam to estimate gaze locations substituting for the eye-tracker, to enhance the model accessibility. The method yields 68.6% accuracy of stress detection without using any special devices. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our method. It opens up a new avenue for cognitive-aware adaptive user interface, intelligent working environment, and related applications.

A handful of these already exist within the world of computational materials discovery, but their dynamic capabilities are somewhat lacking. The PerQueue workflow manager is the answer to this need. By utilizing modular and dynamic building blocks to define a workflow explicitly before starting, PerQueue can give a better overview of the workflow while allowing full flexibility and high dynamism. To exemplify its usage, we present four use cases at different scales within computational materials discovery. These encapsulate high-throughput screening with Density Functional Theory, using active learning to train a Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential with Molecular Dynamics and reusing this potential for kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of extended systems. Lastly, it is used for an active-learning-accelerated image segmentation procedure with a human-in-the-loop.

AB  - In this paper, we establish a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model framework that captures dynamic changes in human trust and workload for contexts that involve interactions between humans and intelligent decision-aid systems. We use a reconnaissance mission study to elicit a dynamic change in human trust and workload with respect to the system’s reliability and user interface transparency as well as the presence or absence of danger. We use human subject data to estimate transition and observation probabilities of the POMDP model and analyze the trust-workload behavior of humans. Our results indicate that higher transparency is more likely to increase human trust when the existing trust is low but also is more likely to decrease trust when it is already high. Furthermore, we show that by using high transparency, the workload of the human is always likely to increase. In our companion paper, we use this estimated model to develop an optimal control policy that varies system transparency to affect human trust-workload behavior towards improving human-machine collaboration.

AB  - Concurrent with autonomous robots, teleoperation gains importance in industrial applications. This includes remote intervention scenarios and human-robot-cooperation during complex or harmful tasks operated from a distance. For an efficient teleoperation, an interface achieving a good user experience and relieving workload of the operators is decisive. Whereas virtual reality allows a spatial integration, environment reconstruction is often based on point clouds in combination with pre-known object models. Challenges exist in spatial representation, through bandwidth limitations and sensor interferences. Furthermore, the potential of knowledge augmentation for workload improvement is often not fully utilized. To overcome these challenges, we present a hybrid environment reconstruction method, which is adaptive regarding the integration of different data sources as well as their derived semantic information levels. For evaluation, a user study is performed. Thereby known procedures to measure usability, immersion, user experience and operator workload serve for evaluation and comparison.

AB  - Netherlands Railways has developed driver advisory systems (DAS) to provide the train driver with route context information and coasting advice in order to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency. However, the impact of these DAS on human factors aspects and safety performance is unclear. The current study assesses the impact of two DAS levels (route context information and coasting advice) on mental workload, attention allocation and safety performance, using eye tracking, a subjective mental workload rating scale (RSME) and simulator data. The overall findings suggest that the application of DAS levels has no negative impact on safety performance and attention allocation towards the trackside compared to a control condition with static timetable information. Furthermore, safety performance benefits significantly from DAS with route context information. DAS were originally developed to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency goals. This study implicates that DAS can also benefit safety performance. The current study found that DAS could decrease workload when the functionalities meet the requirements of the situation. The possible presence of mental underload and its effect on driving performance should be taken into consideration when implementing DAS. It is essential in the development of DAS that it meaningfully enriches the train driving task in stead of simply increasing mental workload.

AB  - Being the latest computing paradigm, cloud computing has proliferated as many IT giants started to deliver resources as services. Thus application providers are free from the burden of the low-level implementation and system administration. Meanwhile, the fact that we are in an era of information explosion brings certain challenges. Some websites may encounter a sharp rising workload due to some unexpected social concerns, which make these websites unavailable or even fail to provide services in time. Currently, a post-action method based on human experience and system alarm is widely used to handle this scenario in industry, which has shortcomings like reaction delay. In our paper, we want to solve this problem by deploying such websites on cloud, and use features of the cloud to tackle it. We present a framework of dynamic virtual resource management in clouds, to cope with traffic burst that applications might encounter. The framework implements a whole work-flow from prediction of the sharp rising workload to a customized resource management module which guarantees the high availability of web applications and cost-effectiveness of the cloud service providers. Our experiments show the accuracy of our workload forecasting method by comparing it with other methods. The 1998 World Cup workload dataset used in our experiment reveals the applicability of our model in the specific scenarios of traffic burst. Also, a simulation-based experiment is designed to indicate that the proposed management framework detects changes in workload intensity that occur over time and allocates multiple virtualized IT resources accordingly to achieve high availability and cost-effective targets.

AB  - The study aimed at investigating the impact of an innovative Wake Vortex Alert (WVA) avionics on pilots' operation and mental states, intending to improve aviation safety by mitigating the risks associated with wake vortex encounters (WVEs). Wake vortices, generated by jet aircraft, pose a significant hazard to trailing or crossing aircrafts. Despite existing separation rules, incidents involving WVEs continue to occur, especially affecting smaller aircrafts like business jets, resulting in aircraft upsets and occasional cabin injuries. To address these challenges, the study focused on developing and validating an alert system that can be presented to air traffic controllers, enabling them to warn flight crews. This empowers the flight crews to either avoid the wake vortex or secure the cabin to prevent injuries. The research employed a multidimensional approach including an analysis of human performance and human factors (HF) issues to determine the potential impact of the alert on pilots' roles, tasks, and mental states. It also utilizes Human Assurance Levels (HALs) to evaluate the necessary human factors support based on the safety criticality of the new system. Realistic flight simulations were conducted to collect data of pilots' behavioural, subjective and neurophysiological responses during WVEs. The data allowed for an objective evaluation of the WVA impact on pilots' operation, behaviour and mental states (mental workload, stress levels and arousal). In particular, the results highlighted the effectiveness of the alert system in facilitating pilots' preparation, awareness and crew resource management (CRM). The results also highlighted the importance of avionics able to enhance aviation safety and reducing risks associated with wake vortex encounters. In particular, we demonstrated how providing timely information and improving situational awareness, the WVA will minimize the occurrence of WVEs and contribute to safer aviation operations.

We collect the manufacturing data of the workload and the expected output for each planning period from the manufacturing execution system and the data monitoring system. Then, we fit the above data as piecewise linear clearing functions (CFs) and import the parameters of clearing functions to the mathematical planning model. A theoretical optimal solution can be calculated by the mathematical model. We import this solution as an initial solution into the discrete-event simulation model to perform simulation iterative optimization, until a satisfactory solution is obtained. To reflect the physical production system data changes in time and to update production plans, we design two update strategies. Strategy 1: The discrete event simulation model in virtual space is updated when key parameters exceed the designed thresholds. Strategy 2: The simulated data used by clearing functions is updated after every production planning process. We fit clearing functions using both historical data and simulation prediction data.

AB  - During the dynamic driving process, classification of mental workload for drivers is a complex task due to multiple factors, including human, vehicle, road, and the environment. Many current studies focus on the impacts of a single factor, such as physiological signal, lane changing, and so on, but these results are usually unsatisfactory due to the incapacity to account for other factors. In response, this work proposes a multi-factor quantification and analysis method to classify the driver's mental workload by incorporating physiological signal, traffic flow, and environment. For physiological signals, we use sensors to gather the driver's Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA). In order to quantify the traffic flow and environment, such as traffic volume, space headway, and weather. We use detection algorithms in images from the car's front and rear driving recorders in the real-world driving experiment on the expressway. Furthermore, we can estimate the distance between surrounding vehicles and the experimental vehicle using the detected car coordinates and camera parameters. This work then applies deep learning algorithms to classify the front driving recorder images into several weather classifications. Finally, the quantified multi-factor data can be utilized to classify the driver's mental workload. Drivers, on the other hand, annotate the data using the NASA Task Load Index Scale's results (NASA-TLX). In our experiments, we compare the classification results of single-factor and multi-factor data with three machine learning algorithms: neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF). The results demonstrate that for traffic volume and space headway from drive recorders, the detection performance of traffic volume in a monocular camera can reach up to 87.3%. Within sight distance, the accuracy of space headway can reach up to 87.1%. The RF algorithm achieves an outstanding classification result with strong stability by incorporating ECG, EDA, traffic flow, and environmental factors, and its classification accuracy achieves 97.8%. These findings further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multi-factor quantification and analysis method.

AB  - Assembly workers face cognitive challenges due to the ongoing trend towards high-variant and small-series assembly of products with shorter lifecycles. To decrease cognitive load and to raise efficiency as well as quality, many companies start using cognitive assistance systems. However, several implementations lack of worker acceptance, which decreases the benefits of assistance systems. An early involvement of workers in the decision-making process can increase acceptance. This paper presents an approach for a digital assembly workstation consisting of several hardware and software components. With this demonstrator, assembly workers can experience the diversity of human-machine interaction technologies and potentials of cognitive support.

We often see ring type and bar type progress indicators in our daily life, but how does one choose the appropriately shaped design? This study uses two experiments to answer the above question, with the aim of maximizing the quality of the user experience. Thirty-six participants were asked to estimate the duration and to evaluate their preferences. The physiological data were collected in real time. The results show that shape affects women's preferences and speed perception for progress indicators. Under the condition of a long waiting time, the waiting experience is better when using the ring type design for all subjects. The quality of the user experience increased when using a progress indicator design that included percentage of task completion. In addition, we provide a reference for the user-friendliness design of progress indicators.

AB  - Human operators in the upcoming Industry 4.0 workplace will face accelerating job demands such as elevated cognitive complexity. Unobtrusive objective measures of mental workload (MWL) are therefore in high demand as indicated by both theory and practice. This pilot study explored the wearability and external validity of pupillometry, a MWL measure robustly validated in laboratory settings and now deployable in work settings demanding operator mobility. In an ecologically valid work environment, 21 participants performed two manual assemblies - one of low and one of high complexity - while wearing eye-tracking glasses for pupil size measurement. Results revealed that the device was perceived as fairly wearable in terms of physical and mental comfort. In terms of validity, no significant differences in mean pupil size were found between the assemblies even though subjective mental workload differed significantly. Exploratory analyses on the pupil size when attending to the assembly instructions only, were inconclusive. The present work suggests that current lab-based procedures might not be adequate yet for in-the-field mobile pupillometry. From a broader perspective, these findings also invite a more nuanced view on the current validity of lab-validated physiological MWL-measures when applied in real-life settings. We therefore conclude with some key insights for future development of mobile pupillometry.

AB  - Fatigue is a critically important aspect of crew endurance in submarine operations, with continuously high fatigue being associated with increased risk of human error and long-term negative health ramifications. Submarines pose several unique challenges to fatigue mitigation, including requirements for continuous manning for long durations, a lack of access to critical environmental zeitgebers (stimuli pertinent to circadian physiology; e.g., natural sunlight), and work, rest and sleep occurring within an encapsulated environment. In this paper, we examine the factors that underlie fatigue in such a context with the aim of evaluating the predictive utility of a biomathematical model (BMM) of fatigue. Three experience sampling studies were conducted with submarine crews using a participant-led measurement protocol that included assessments of subjective sleepiness, workload (NASA-Task Load Index [TLX] and a bespoke underload-overload scale), and sleep. As expected, results indicated that predicting KSS with a BMM approach outperformed more conventional linear modelling approaches (e.g., time-of-day, sleep duration, time awake). Both the homeostatic and circadian components of the BMM were significantly associated with KSS and used as controls in the workload models. We found increased NASA-TLX workload was significantly associated with increased average KSS ratings at the between-person level. However, counter to expectations, the two workload measures were not found to have significant linear or quadratic relationship with fatigue at the within-person level. An important outcome of the research is that applied fatigue researchers should be extremely cautious applying conventional linear predictors when predicting fatigue. Practical implications for the submarine and related extreme work context are discussed. Important avenues for continued research are outlined, including directly estimating BMM parameters.

AB  - Attacks exploiting human attentional vulnerability have posed severe threats to cybersecurity. In this work, we identify and formally define a new type of proactive attentional attacks called Informational Denial-of-Service (IDoS) attacks that generate a large volume of feint attacks to overload human operators and hide real attacks among feints. We incorporate human factors (e.g., levels of expertise, stress, and efficiency) and empirical psychological results (e.g., the Yerkes-Dodson law and the sunk cost fallacy) to model the operators’ attention dynamics and their decision-making processes along with the real-time alert monitoring and inspection. To assist human operators in dismissing the feints and escalating the real attacks timely and accurately, we develop a Resilient and Adaptive Data-driven alert and Attention Management Strategy (RADAMS) that de-emphasizes alerts selectively based on the abstracted category labels of the alerts. RADAMS uses reinforcement learning to achieve a customized and transferable design for various human operators and evolving IDoS attacks. The integrated modeling and theoretical analysis lead to the Product Principle of Attention (PPoA), fundamental limits, and the tradeoff among crucial human and economic factors. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed strategy outperforms the default strategy and can reduce the IDoS risk by as much as 20%. Besides, the strategy is resilient to large variations of costs, attack frequencies, and human attention capacities. We have recognized interesting phenomena such as attentional risk equivalency, attacker’s dilemma, and the half-truth optimal attack strategy.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested cortical involvement in postural control in humans by measuring cortical activities and conducting dual-task paradigms. In dual-task paradigms, task performance deteriorates and can be facilitated in specific dual-task settings. Theoretical frameworks explaining these dual-task interactions have been proposed and debated for decades. Therefore, we investigated postural control performance under different visual conditions using a virtual reality system, simultaneously measuring cortical activities with a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Twenty-four healthy participants were included in this study. Postural stability and cortical activities after perturbations were measured under several conditions consisting of postural and visual perturbations. The results showed that concurrent visual and postural perturbations could facilitate cortical activities in the supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobe. Additionally, visual distractors deteriorated postural control ability and cortical activation of the supplementary motor area. These findings supported the theoretical framework of the “Cross talk model”, in which concurrent tasks using similar neural domains can facilitate these task performances. Furthermore, it indicated that the cortical resource capacity and domains activated for information processing should be considered in experiments involving dual-task paradigms and training.

AB  - Traffic safety is directly related to the mental and physical condition of the driver. Performing regular secondary tasks while driving is an additional activity that dissipates attention and adds to the drivers' workload. Identifying driver fatigue and workload based on gaze behavior is one way to ensure a safe driving experience. The purpose of this paper is to classify and predict driving perceived workload using a set of eye-tracking metrics (gaze fixation, duration, pointing, and pupil diameter). The ability of eye-tracking metrics to predict driving workload has been investigated. As a result, frustration, performance, and temporal load showed a correlation with gaze metrics. Gaze point, duration, fixation, and pupil diameter significantly influence driving workload. Relevance to industry: Results will supply the specialists in eye-tracking/sensor technologies and traffic safety with new knowledge to improve the design of the driving performance and safety monitoring systems and efficiency of the driving process.

AB  - In this paper we use the SMS instant messaging application to examine the effect of notifications on time preferences. To do so, we conducted a laboratory experiment with three different groups. Participants in the first (second) treatment group received SMS messages with a high (low) degree of frequency. The third group was a control group that did not receive any SMS messages. The results show that, with exposure to SMS notifications, regardless of their frequency, the tendency to favor the present increases. They also indicate that SMS notifications affect impulsiveness and stress. However, the influence of impulsiveness and stress were not the factors that activated the change in time preferences. In addition to the contribution to the literature on smartphones and human behavior, our results have real-life implications regarding how we make decisions when we are interrupted by notifications from our mobile devices.

AB  - Objective
To determine how firefighters experience and manage sleep inertia (the state of impaired alertness and performance upon waking) during night calls.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen volunteer firefighters. Firefighters were asked about their experiences of sleep inertia and what strategies they use to manage sleep inertia when waking and responding to night calls.
Results
Firefighters perceive that the duration and risk of sleep inertia is less than what is commonly espoused in the literature. This presents a potential barrier to implementing sleep inertia countermeasures in this cohort. However, firefighters informally managed sleep inertia directly and indirectly. Several deliberate strategies to directly reduce sleep inertia (e.g., running to and from their car), and indirect strategies to manage the impact of sleep inertia (e.g., risk assessments) emerged. Moreover, it was identified that various aspects of the firefighting role have the potential to reduce sleep inertia through multifactorial physical and mental stimulation (e.g., through waking to the pager alarm and the cognitive demand of firefighting tasks).
Conclusions
The firefighting role can be inherently stimulating and has the potential to reduce the severity of sleep inertia for firefighters waking and responding to night calls. Regardless, informal strategies to manage sleep inertia could be incorporated into formal education procedures of organisations to improve the safety of firefighters.
Relevance to industry
Informal sleep inertia management strategies could be formalised to help educate less experienced firefighters on how to manage night-time calls and improve the safety of personnel in the firefighting industry.

AB  - Telerobotic operation, i.e., a human operator to manipulate remote robotic systems at a distance, has started to gain its popularity in the construction industry. It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for teleoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye-tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX surveys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more accurate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages.

AB  - Order review and release research has brought several different release methods forward to improve the performance of a manufacturing system. Two of the most recognized methods are Workload Control (WLC) and Constant Work-in-Progress (ConWIP). Both depend on a backlog of not yet released orders which is organized in a pre-shop pool. Lately, the sequencing of the backlog has received increasing attention for both methods. Existing research shows the performance-increasing potential of capacity slack-based sequencing rules. This paper analyzes this potential by further developing some of the known rules and applying them to both WLC and ConWIP using a simulating approach.

AB  - Blockchain technology, with its attributes of decentralization, immutability, and traceability, has emerged as a powerful catalyst for enhancing traditional industries in terms of optimizing business processes. However, transaction performance and scalability has become the main challenges hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain. Due to its inability to meet the demands of high-frequency trading, blockchain cannot be adopted in many scenarios. To improve the transaction capacity, researchers have proposed some on-chain scaling technologies, including lightning networks, directed acyclic graph technology, state channels, and sharding mechanisms, in which sharding emerges as a potential scaling technology. Nevertheless, excessive cross-shard transactions and uneven shard workloads prevent the sharding mechanism from achieving the expected aim. This paper proposes a graph-based sharding scheme for public blockchain to efficiently balance the transaction distribution. By mitigating cross-shard transactions and evening-out workloads among shards, the scheme reduces transaction confirmation latency and enhances the transaction capacity of the blockchain. Therefore, the scheme can achieve a high-frequency transaction as well as a better blockchain scalability. Experiments results show that the scheme effectively reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio to a range of 35%–56% and significantly decreases the transaction confirmation latency to 6 s in a blockchain with no more than 25 shards.

AB  - With the wide application of intelligent driving assistance system, the augmented reality head-up display (AR HUD) interface plays an increasingly important role in drivers' real-time perception of traffic environment. As the AR HUD is vulnerable to be affected by changed ambient light, it weakens the legibility of the virtual interface and driver's visual comfort to a certain extent. The content color, as one of interface visual design elements, directly affects the performance of driver, which include the visual sensitivity and fatigue and further influences the vehicle safety. The selection between luminance contrast (affects sensitive and number of applicable environments) and driver performance (affects fatigue) are contradictory issues. In order to solve this contradictory problem in the design of AR HUD interface, and balance the cognitive load and situation awareness of driver, an extended analysis and optimization method of interface element was proposed. This method quantifies the discrete interface elements and makes the opposition problem consistent. The content color selection models under two conditions are constructed, which describe the distance from the chosen color to the optimal interval. It has been proved to be effective in finding the best answer for driver performance in interface design. Other interface elements in AR HUD can also be further optimized based on this method.

AB  - Brake reaction time is a key component to studying driving performance and evaluating fitness to drive. Although commercial simulators can measure brake reaction time, their cost remains a major barrier to clinical access. Therefore, we developed open-source software written in C-sharp (C#) for measuring driving related reaction times, which includes a subject-controlled vehicle with straight-line dynamics and several testing scenarios. The software measures both simple and cognitive load based reaction times and can use any human interface device compliant steering wheel and pedals. Measures from the software were validated against a commercial simulator and tested for reproducibility. Further, experiments were performed using hand controls in both able-bodied and spinal cord injured patients to determine clinical feasibility for disabled populations. The software demonstrated high validity when measuring brake reaction times, showed excellent test-retest reliability, and was sensitive enough to determine significant brake reaction time differences between able-bodied and spinal cord injured subjects. These results indicate that the proposed simulator is a simple and feasible low-cost solution to perform brake reaction time tests and evaluate fitness to drive.

AB  - Predicting accuracy in cognitively challenging tasks has potential applications in education and industry. Task demand has been linked with increases in response time and variations in reaction time and eye-tracking metrics, however, machine learning research has not been used to predict performance on tasks with multiple levels of difficulty. We report data on adult participants who performed tasks of mental attentional capacity with six levels of difficulty and use machine learning methods to predict accuracy scores considering metrics associated with task difficulty, reaction time and eye movements. Results show that machine learning models can robustly predict performance with reaction times and difficulty level being the strongest predictors. Eye-tracking indices can also predict accuracy independently, with the most important features of the model driven by the number of fixations, number of saccades, duration of the current fixation and pupil size. Practical and theoretical implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - Today’s smart production facilities’ increasing modularity and continuous reconfiguration require appropriate logistic support processes. The main challenges here are complexity and the frequent alteration of factory output. To cope with them the resulting logistic system is over dimensioned compared to the average, in order to match the change of needs in the production schedule, which frequently leads to inefficiency in energy consumption, as a relatively large logistic system supplies the production. The current paper describes a method where the material flow system is controlled in a way considering both aspects of schedule adherence and energy management. A simulation model has been developed to prove the concept’s applicability. Results have indicated that the proposed control method reacts effectively for the urgent tasks and change of workload.

AB  - The ever increasing computing demands in embedded systems is driving the adoption of hardware accelerators such as GPUs, which offer powerful platforms that can compute parallel workloads efficiently. Relevant critical applications that benefit from such platforms, for instance autonomous driving, usually impose additional real-time requirements that must be met to guarantee the correctness of the systems. In this paper, we propose exploiting readily available and extensively validated techniques to model and analyze real-time systems with GPUs. Specifically, we propose a methodology to employ the MAST model to characterize such systems, and different variants of the Offset-Based Response-Time Analysis techniques to validate the real-time requirements. We verify our approach with a real industrial application sourced from the railway industry. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving synthetic and real task-sets, we characterize the applicability of the approach, and we also show how estimated worst-case response times are aligned with real measurements up to 87.2%.
